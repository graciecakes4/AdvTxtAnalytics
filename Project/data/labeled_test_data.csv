Transcriber’s Notes:

As you may be aware, Project Gutenberg has been involved with the
writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now, and since we
get a few questions about the order in which the books should be read,
and in which they were published, these following comments should
hopefully help most of our readers.

***

The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of D’Artagnan Romances:
it is usually split into three or four parts, and the final portion
is entitled The Man in the Iron Mask. The Man in the Iron Mask we’re
familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.
[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the
confusion...but wait...there’s yet more reason for confusion.]

We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four
etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la
Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask.

One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,
entitled Ten Years Later, says it’s the sequel to The Three Musketeers.
While this is technically true, there’s another book, Twenty Years
After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts
that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years
After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty
Years “After” the original story...however, this is why the different
words “After” and “Later”...the Ten Years “After” is ten years after
the Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the
D’Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the
subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different
volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the
first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later
can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the
four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,
it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material
in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the
series which may prove helpful:

The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D’Artagnan Romances.
Covers the years 1625-1628.

Twenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D’Artagnan Romances.
Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but
second in time sequence!!!]

Ten Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the
D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.

The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First
75 chapters of the third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the
year 1660.

Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (second in the new series)--Chapters
76-140 of that third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
1660-1661. [In this particular editing of it]

Louise de la Valliere: Etext 2710 (third in the new series)--Chapters
141-208 of the third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the year
1661.

The Man in the Iron Mask: Etext 2759 (our next text)--Chapters
209-269 of the third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
1661-1673.

Introduction:

In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le Siecle, the
first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated playwright
Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had
found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a
history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures
of a young man named D’Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost
immediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and
ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers
would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,
Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the
scenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English
history.

Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,
and became the three D’Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief
summary of the first two novels:

The Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.
The young D’Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and
almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.
Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal’s
guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.
The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D’Artagnan’s landlord
to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them
across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the
Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,
named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of
Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the
four friends.

Twenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now
1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has
died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit
upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,
the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.
D’Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have
retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de
la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.
Aramis, whose real name is D’Herblay, has followed his intention of
shedding the musketeer’s cassock for the priest’s robes, and Porthos has
married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But
trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the
institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at
home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D’Artagnan brings
his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,
but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother’s death
at the musketeers’ hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our
heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,
quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.

The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October,
1847--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English
translation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at
various points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does
not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the
three-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,
Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of
this etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition
does, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,
Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first three
etexts:

The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and
D’Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become
disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with
the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on
his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,
and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune
in the process. D’Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich
citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king’s
brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own
estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to
assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly
Mazarin’s trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,
the king’s superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any
means necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant
bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet’s
loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king’s attention
that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could
possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation
against the king. Louis calls D’Artagnan out of retirement and sends
him to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his
long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At
Belle-Isle, D’Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications
is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that’s not all.
The blueprints for the island, although in Porthos’s handwriting,
show evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.
D’Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,
which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting
that D’Artagnan has arrived on the king’s behalf to investigate, Aramis
tricks D’Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,
and sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of
the danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a
present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating
Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an
audience with the king.

Ten Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of
England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into
complete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is
in love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,
thankfully prevented by Raoul’s timely and tactful intervention. After
the marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of
Buckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke
fights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and
spiteful man, the sworn enemy of D’Artagnan, and, by the same token,
that of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are
seriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.
Raoul’s friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to
Henrietta’s charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De
Guiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the king’s eye falls on
Madame Henrietta during the comte’s absence, and this time Monsieur’s
jealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and
his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king
can pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They
unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoul’s fiancee. While the
court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears
Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends
beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for
Madame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De
Guiche confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their
own affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise
are trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the
scandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise’s attachment,
the king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite
period.

Meanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.
Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask
Fouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it
for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his
new mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels
and her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown
friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that
Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D’Artagnan while inquiring of him
as to Aramis’s whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the
musketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden
overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet
had already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the
governor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable
resemblance to Louis XIV--in fact, the two are identical. He uses
the existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the
general of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new
general of the order. On Aramis’s advice, hoping to use Louise’s
influence with the king to counteract Colbert’s influence, Fouquet also
writes a love letter to La Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never
reaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it
turns out to be an agent of Colbert’s.

Louise de la Valliere (Etext 2710): Believing D’Artagnan occupied at
Fontainebleau and Porthos safely tucked away at Paris, Aramis holds a
funeral for the dead Franciscan--but in fact, Aramis is wrong in both
suppositions. D’Artagnan has left Fontainebleau, bored to tears by
the _fetes_, retrieved Porthos, and is visiting the country-house of
Planchet, his old lackey. This house happens to be right next door
to the graveyard, and upon observing Aramis at this funeral, and his
subsequent meeting with a mysterious hooded lady, D’Artagnan, suspicions
aroused, resolves to make a little trouble for the bishop. He presents
Porthos to the king at the same time as Fouquet presents Aramis, thereby
surprising the wily prelate. Aramis’s professions of affection and
innocence do only a little to allay D’Artagnan’s concerns, and he
continues to regard Aramis’s actions with a curious and wary eye.
Meanwhile, much to his delight, Porthos is invited to dine with the king
as a result of his presentation, and with D’Artagnan’s guidance, manages
to behave in such a manner as to procure the king’s marked favor.

The mysterious woman turns out to be the Duchesse de Chevreuse, a
notorious schemer and former friend of Anne of Austria. She comes
bearing more bad news for Fouquet, who is already in trouble, as the
king has invited himself to a _fete_ at Vaux, Fouquet’s magnificent
mansion, that will surely bankrupt the poor superintendent. The Duchesse
has letters from Mazarin that prove that Fouquet has received thirteen
million francs from the royal coffers, and she wishes to sell these
letters to Aramis. Aramis refuses, and the letters are instead sold to
Colbert. Fouquet, meanwhile, discovers that the receipt that proves his
innocence in the affair has been stolen from him. Even worse, Fouquet,
desperate for money, is forced to sell the parliamentary position that
renders him untouchable by any court proceedings. As part of her deal
with Colbert, though, Chevreuse also obtains a secret audience with the
queen-mother, where the two discuss a shocking secret--Louis XIV has a
twin brother, long believed, however, to be dead.

Meanwhile, in other quarters, De Wardes, Raoul’s inveterate enemy, has
returned from Calais, barely recovered from his wounds, and no sooner
does he return than he begins again to insult people, particularly La
Valliere, and this time the comte de Guiche is the one to challenge him.
The duel leaves De Guiche horribly wounded, but enables Madame to use
her influence to destroy De Wardes’s standing at court. The _fetes_,
however, come to an end, and the court returns to Paris. The king has
been more than obvious about his affections for Louise, and Madame,
the queen-mother, and the queen join forces to destroy her. She is
dishonorably discharged from court, and in despair, she flees to the
convent at Chaillot. Along the way, though, she runs into D’Artagnan,
who manages to get word back to the king of what has taken place. By
literally begging Madame in tears, Louis manages to secure Louise’s
return to court--but Madame still places every obstacle possible before
the lovers. They have to resort to building a secret staircase and
meeting in the apartments of M. de Saint-Aignan, where Louis has a
painter create a portrait of Louise. But Madame recalls Raoul from
London and shows him these proofs of Louise’s infidelity. Raoul,
crushed, challenges Saint-Aignan to a duel, which the king prevents,
and Athos, furious, breaks his sword before the king. The king has
D’Artagnan arrest Athos, and at the Bastile they encounter Aramis, who
is paying Baisemeaux another visit. Raoul learns of Athos’s arrest,
and with Porthos in tow, they effect a daring rescue, surprising the
carriage containing D’Artagnan and Athos as they leave the Bastile.
Although quite impressive, the intrepid raid is in vain, as D’Artagnan
has already secured Athos’s pardon from the king. Instead, everybody
switches modes of transport; D’Artagnan and Porthos take the horses back
to Paris, and Athos and Raoul take the carriage back to La Fere, where
they intend to reside permanently, as the king is now their sworn enemy,
Raoul cannot bear to see Louise, and they have no more dealings in
Paris.

Aramis, left alone with Baisemeaux, inquires the governor of the prison
about his loyalties, in particular to the Jesuits. The bishop reveals
that he is a confessor of the society, and invokes their regulations
in order to obtain access to this mysterious prisoner who bears such a
striking resemblance to Louis XIV...

And so Baisemeaux is conducting Aramis to the prisoner as the final
section of The Vicomte de Bragelonne and this final story of the
D’Artagnan Romances opens. I have written a “Cast of Historical
Characters,” Etext 2760, that will enable curious readers to compare
personages in the novel with their historical counterparts. Also of
interest may be an essay Dumas wrote on the possible identity of the
real Man in the Iron Mask, which is Etext 2751. Enjoy!

Chapter I. The Prisoner.

Since Aramis’s singular transformation into a confessor of the order,
Baisemeaux was no longer the same man. Up to that period, the place
which Aramis had held in the worthy governor’s estimation was that of
a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of
gratitude; but now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was
his master. He himself lighted a lantern, summoned a turnkey, and said,
returning to Aramis, “I am at your orders, monseigneur.” Aramis merely
nodded his head, as much as to say, “Very good”; and signed to him with
his hand to lead the way. Baisemeaux advanced, and Aramis followed him.
It was a calm and lovely starlit night; the steps of three men resounded
on the flags of the terraces, and the clinking of the keys hanging from
the jailer’s girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers,
as if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury
beyond their reach. It might have been said that the alteration effected
in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners. The turnkey, the same who,
on Aramis’s first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious,
was now not only silent, but impassible. He held his head down, and
seemed afraid to keep his ears open. In this wise they reached the
basement of the Bertaudiere, the two first stories of which were
mounted silently and somewhat slowly; for Baisemeaux, though far from
disobeying, was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey. On arriving
at the door, Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner’s
chamber; but Aramis, stopping him on the threshold, said, “The rules do
not allow the governor to hear the prisoner’s confession.”

Baisemeaux bowed, and made way for Aramis, who took the lantern and
entered; and then signed to them to close the door behind him. For
an instant he remained standing, listening whether Baisemeaux and the
turnkey had retired; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their
descending footsteps that they had left the tower, he put the lantern
on the table and gazed around. On a bed of green serge, similar in all
respect to the other beds in the Bastile, save that it was newer, and
under curtains half-drawn, reposed a young man, to whom we have already
once before introduced Aramis. According to custom, the prisoner was
without a light. At the hour of curfew, he was bound to extinguish his
lamp, and we perceive how much he was favored, in being allowed to keep
it burning even till then. Near the bed a large leathern armchair,
with twisted legs, sustained his clothes. A little table--without pens,
books, paper, or ink--stood neglected in sadness near the window; while
several plates, still unemptied, showed that the prisoner had scarcely
touched his evening meal. Aramis saw that the young man was stretched
upon his bed, his face half concealed by his arms. The arrival of a
visitor did not caused any change of position; either he was waiting in
expectation, or was asleep. Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern,
pushed back the armchair, and approached the bed with an evident mixture
of interest and respect. The young man raised his head. “What is it?”
 said he.

“You desired a confessor?” replied Aramis.

“Yes.”

“Because you were ill?”

“Yes.”

“Very ill?”

The young man gave Aramis a piercing glance, and answered, “I thank
you.” After a moment’s silence, “I have seen you before,” he continued.
Aramis bowed.

Doubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold, crafty,
and imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of
Vannes was little reassuring to one in his situation, for he added, “I
am better.”

“And so?” said Aramis.

“Why, then--being better, I have no longer the same need of a confessor,
I think.”

“Not even of the hair-cloth, which the note you found in your bread
informed you of?”

The young man started; but before he had either assented or denied,
Aramis continued, “Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to
hear an important revelation?”

“If it be so,” said the young man, sinking again on his pillow, “it is
different; I am listening.”

Aramis then looked at him more closely, and was struck with the easy
majesty of his mien, one which can never be acquired unless Heaven
has implanted it in the blood or heart. “Sit down, monsieur,” said the
prisoner.

Aramis bowed and obeyed. “How does the Bastile agree with you?” asked
the bishop.

“Very well.”

“You do not suffer?”

“No.”

“You have nothing to regret?”

“Nothing.”

“Not even your liberty?”

“What do you call liberty, monsieur?” asked the prisoner, with the tone
of a man who is preparing for a struggle.

“I call liberty, the flowers, the air, light, the stars, the happiness
of going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish
to carry you.”

The young man smiled, whether in resignation or contempt, it was
difficult to tell. “Look,” said he, “I have in that Japanese vase two
roses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor’s garden;
this morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath
my gaze; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their
perfumes, filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it. Look now
on these two roses; even among roses these are beautiful, and the rose
is the most beautiful of flowers. Why, then, do you bid me desire other
flowers when I possess the loveliest of all?”

Aramis gazed at the young man in surprise.

“If _flowers_ constitute liberty,” sadly resumed the captive, “I am
free, for I possess them.”

“But the air!” cried Aramis; “air is so necessary to life!”

“Well, monsieur,” returned the prisoner; “draw near to the window; it is
open. Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages
of hail and lightning, exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle
breezes. It caresses my face. When mounted on the back of this armchair,
with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself, I fancy
I am swimming the wide expanse before me.” The countenance of Aramis
darkened as the young man continued: “Light I have! what is better than
light? I have the sun, a friend who comes to visit me every day without
the permission of the governor or the jailer’s company. He comes in
at the window, and traces in my room a square the shape of the window,
which lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very floor. This
luminous square increases from ten o’clock till midday, and decreases
from one till three slowly, as if, having hastened to my presence, it
sorrowed at bidding me farewell. When its last ray disappears I have
enjoyed its presence for five hours. Is not that sufficient? I have been
told that there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries, and laborers who
toil in mines, who never behold it at all.” Aramis wiped the drops from
his brow. “As to the stars which are so delightful to view,” continued
the young man, “they all resemble each other save in size and
brilliancy. I am a favored mortal, for if you had not lighted that
candle you would have been able to see the beautiful stars which I was
gazing at from my couch before your arrival, whose silvery rays were
stealing through my brain.”

Aramis lowered his head; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter
flow of that sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive.

“So much, then, for the flowers, the air, the daylight, and the stars,”
 tranquilly continued the young man; “there remains but exercise. Do
I not walk all day in the governor’s garden if it is fine--here if it
rains? in the fresh air if it is warm; in perfect warmth, thanks to my
winter stove, if it be cold? Ah! monsieur, do you fancy,” continued the
prisoner, not without bitterness, “that men have not done everything for
me that a man can hope for or desire?”

“Men!” said Aramis; “be it so; but it seems to me you are forgetting
Heaven.”

“Indeed I have forgotten Heaven,” murmured the prisoner, with emotion;
“but why do you mention it? Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of
Heaven?”

Aramis looked steadily at this singular youth, who possessed the
resignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist. “Is not Heaven in
everything?” he murmured in a reproachful tone.

“Say rather, at the end of everything,” answered the prisoner, firmly.

“Be it so,” said Aramis; “but let us return to our starting-point.”

“I ask nothing better,” returned the young man.

“I am your confessor.”

“Yes.”

“Well, then, you ought, as a penitent, to tell me the truth.”

“My whole desire is to tell it you.”

“Every prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been
imprisoned. What crime, then, have you committed?”

“You asked me the same question the first time you saw me,” returned the
prisoner.

“And then, as now you evaded giving me an answer.”

“And what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you?”

“Because this time I am your confessor.”

“Then if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed, explain to
me in what a crime consists. For as my conscience does not accuse me, I
aver that I am not a criminal.”

“We are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth, not
alone for having ourselves committed crimes, but because we know that
crimes have been committed.”

The prisoner manifested the deepest attention.

“Yes, I understand you,” he said, after a pause; “yes, you are right,
monsieur; it is very possible that, in such a light, I am a criminal in
the eyes of the great of the earth.”

“Ah! then you know something,” said Aramis, who thought he had pierced
not merely through a defect in the harness, but through the joints of
it.

“No, I am not aware of anything,” replied the young man; “but sometimes
I think--and I say to myself--”

“What do you say to yourself?”

“That if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad
or I should divine a great deal.”

“And then--and then?” said Aramis, impatiently.

“Then I leave off.”

“You leave off?”

“Yes; my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy; I feel _ennui_
overtaking me; I wish--”

“What?”

“I don’t know; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things
which I do not possess, when I am so happy with what I have.”

“You are afraid of death?” said Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.

“Yes,” said the young man, smiling.

Aramis felt the chill of that smile, and shuddered. “Oh, as you fear
death, you know more about matters than you say,” he cried.

“And you,” returned the prisoner, “who bade me to ask to see you;
you, who, when I did ask to see you, came here promising a world of
confidence; how is it that, nevertheless, it is you who are silent,
leaving it for me to speak? Since, then, we both wear masks, either let
us both retain them or put them aside together.”

Aramis felt the force and justice of the remark, saying to himself,
“This is no ordinary man; I must be cautious.--Are you ambitious?”
 said he suddenly to the prisoner, aloud, without preparing him for the
alteration.

“What do you mean by ambitious?” replied the youth.

“Ambition,” replied Aramis, “is the feeling which prompts a man to
desire more--much more--than he possesses.”

“I said that I was contented, monsieur; but, perhaps, I deceive myself.
I am ignorant of the nature of ambition; but it is not impossible I may
have some. Tell me your mind; that is all I ask.”

“An ambitious man,” said Aramis, “is one who covets that which is beyond
his station.”

“I covet nothing beyond my station,” said the young man, with an
assurance of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes
tremble.

He was silent. But to look at the kindling eye, the knitted brow, and
the reflective attitude of the captive, it was evident that he expected
something more than silence,--a silence which Aramis now broke. “You
lied the first time I saw you,” said he.

“Lied!” cried the young man, starting up on his couch, with such a tone
in his voice, and such a lightning in his eyes, that Aramis recoiled, in
spite of himself.

“I _should_ say,” returned Aramis, bowing, “you concealed from me what
you knew of your infancy.”

“A man’s secrets are his own, monsieur,” retorted the prisoner, “and not
at the mercy of the first chance-comer.”

“True,” said Aramis, bowing still lower than before, “‘tis true; pardon
me, but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer? I beseech
you to reply, monseigneur.”

This title slightly disturbed the prisoner; but nevertheless he did not
appear astonished that it was given him. “I do not know you, monsieur,”
 said he.

“Oh, but if I dared, I would take your hand and kiss it!”

The young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand;
but the light which beamed in his eyes faded away, and he coldly and
distrustfully withdrew his hand again. “Kiss the hand of a prisoner,” he
said, shaking his head, “to what purpose?”

“Why did you tell me,” said Aramis, “that you were happy here? Why, that
you aspired to nothing? Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent
me from being frank in my turn?”

The same light shone a third time in the young man’s eyes, but died
ineffectually away as before.

“You distrust me,” said Aramis.

“And why say you so, monsieur?”

“Oh, for a very simple reason; if you know what you ought to know, you
ought to mistrust everybody.”

“Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful, since you suspect me
of knowing what I do not know.”

Aramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance. “Oh,
monseigneur! you drive me to despair,” said he, striking the armchair
with his fist.

“And, on my part, I do not comprehend you, monsieur.”

“Well, then, try to understand me.” The prisoner looked fixedly at
Aramis.

“Sometimes it seems to me,” said the latter, “that I have before me the
man whom I seek, and then--”

“And then your man disappears,--is it not so?” said the prisoner,
smiling. “So much the better.”

Aramis rose. “Certainly,” said he; “I have nothing further to say to a
man who mistrusts me as you do.”

“And I, monsieur,” said the prisoner, in the same tone, “have nothing
to say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be
mistrustful of everybody.”

“Even of his old friends,” said Aramis. “Oh, monseigneur, you are _too_
prudent!”

“Of my old friends?--you one of my old friends,--you?”

“Do you no longer remember,” said Aramis, “that you once saw, in the
village where your early years were spent--”

“Do you know the name of the village?” asked the prisoner.

“Noisy-le-Sec, monseigneur,” answered Aramis, firmly.

“Go on,” said the young man, with an immovable aspect.

“Stay, monseigneur,” said Aramis; “if you are positively resolved to
carry on this game, let us break off. I am here to tell you many things,
‘tis true; but you must allow me to see that, on your side, you have
a desire to know them. Before revealing the important matters I still
withhold, be assured I am in need of some encouragement, if not candor;
a little sympathy, if not confidence. But you keep yourself intrenched
in a pretended which paralyzes me. Oh, not for the reason you think;
for, ignorant as you may be, or indifferent as you feign to be, you are
none the less what you are, monseigneur, and there is nothing--nothing,
mark me! which can cause you not to be so.”

“I promise you,” replied the prisoner, “to hear you without impatience.
Only it appears to me that I have a right to repeat the question I have
already asked, ‘Who _are_ you?’”

“Do you remember, fifteen or eighteen years ago, seeing at Noisy-le-Sec
a cavalier, accompanied by a lady in black silk, with flame-colored
ribbons in her hair?”

“Yes,” said the young man; “I once asked the name of this cavalier, and
they told me that he called himself the Abbe d’Herblay. I was astonished
that the abbe had so warlike an air, and they replied that there was
nothing singular in that, seeing that he was one of Louis XIII.’s
musketeers.”

“Well,” said Aramis, “that musketeer and abbe, afterwards bishop of
Vannes, is your confessor now.”

“I know it; I recognized you.”

“Then, monseigneur, if you know that, I must further add a fact of which
you are ignorant--that if the king were to know this evening of the
presence of this musketeer, this abbe, this bishop, this confessor,
_here_--he, who has risked everything to visit you, to-morrow would
behold the steely glitter of the executioner’s axe in a dungeon more
gloomy, more obscure than yours.”

While listening to these words, delivered with emphasis, the young
man had raised himself on his couch, and was now gazing more and more
eagerly at Aramis.

The result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some
confidence from it. “Yes,” he murmured, “I remember perfectly. The
woman of whom you speak came once with you, and twice afterwards with
another.” He hesitated.

“With another, who came to see you every month--is it not so,
monseigneur?”

“Yes.”

“Do you know who this lady was?”

The light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner’s eyes. “I am aware
that she was one of the ladies of the court,” he said.

“You remember that lady well, do you not?”

“Oh, my recollection can hardly be very confused on this head,” said the
young prisoner. “I saw that lady once with a gentleman about forty-five
years old. I saw her once with you, and with the lady dressed in black.
I have seen her twice since then with the same person. These four
people, with my master, and old Perronnette, my jailer, and the governor
of the prison, are the only persons with whom I have ever spoken, and,
indeed, almost the only persons I have ever seen.”

“Then you were in prison?”

“If I am a prisoner here, then I was comparatively free, although in
a very narrow sense--a house I never quitted, a garden surrounded with
walls I could not climb, these constituted my residence, but you know
it, as you have been there. In a word, being accustomed to live within
these bounds, I never cared to leave them. And so you will understand,
monsieur, that having never seen anything of the world, I have nothing
left to care for; and therefore, if you relate anything, you will be
obliged to explain each item to me as you go along.”

“And I will do so,” said Aramis, bowing; “for it is my duty,
monseigneur.”

“Well, then, begin by telling me who was my tutor.”

“A worthy and, above all, an honorable gentleman, monseigneur; fit guide
for both body and soul. Had you ever any reason to complain of him?”

“Oh, no; quite the contrary. But this gentleman of yours often used to
tell me that my father and mother were dead. Did he deceive me, or did
he speak the truth?”

“He was compelled to comply with the orders given him.”

“Then he lied?”

“In one respect. Your father is dead.”

“And my mother?”

“She is dead _for you_.”

“But then she lives for others, does she not?”

“Yes.”

“And I--and I, then” (the young man looked sharply at Aramis) “am
compelled to live in the obscurity of a prison?”

“Alas! I fear so.”

“And that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation
of a great secret?”

“Certainly, a very great secret.”

“My enemy must indeed be powerful, to be able to shut up in the Bastile
a child such as I then was.”

“He is.”

“More powerful than my mother, then?”

“And why do you ask that?”

“Because my mother would have taken my part.”

Aramis hesitated. “Yes, monseigneur; more powerful than your mother.”

“Seeing, then, that my nurse and preceptor were carried off, and that I,
also, was separated from them--either they were, or I am, very dangerous
to my enemy?”

“Yes; but you are alluding to a peril from which he freed himself, by
causing the nurse and preceptor to disappear,” answered Aramis, quietly.

“Disappear!” cried the prisoner, “how did they disappear?”

“In a very sure way,” answered Aramis--“they are dead.”

The young man turned pale, and passed his hand tremblingly over his
face. “Poison?” he asked.

“Poison.”

The prisoner reflected a moment. “My enemy must indeed have been very
cruel, or hard beset by necessity, to assassinate those two innocent
people, my sole support; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had
never harmed a living being.”

“In your family, monseigneur, necessity is stern. And so it is necessity
which compels me, to my great regret, to tell you that this gentleman
and the unhappy lady have been assassinated.”

“Oh, you tell me nothing I am not aware of,” said the prisoner, knitting
his brows.

“How?”

“I suspected it.”

“Why?”

“I will tell you.”

At this moment the young man, supporting himself on his two elbows,
drew close to Aramis’s face, with such an expression of dignity, of
self-command and of defiance even, that the bishop felt the electricity
of enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great heart of his,
into his brain of adamant.

“Speak, monseigneur. I have already told you that by conversing with you
I endanger my life. Little value as it has, I implore you to accept it
as the ransom of your own.”

“Well,” resumed the young man, “this is why I suspected they had killed
my nurse and my preceptor--”

“Whom you used to call your father?”

“Yes; whom I called my father, but whose son I well knew I was not.”

“Who caused you to suppose so?”

“Just as you, monsieur, are too respectful for a friend, he was also too
respectful for a father.”

“I, however,” said Aramis, “have no intention to disguise myself.”

The young man nodded assent and continued: “Undoubtedly, I was not
destined to perpetual seclusion,” said the prisoner; “and that which
makes me believe so, above all, now, is the care that was taken to
render me as accomplished a cavalier as possible. The gentleman attached
to my person taught me everything he knew himself--mathematics, a little
geometry, astronomy, fencing and riding. Every morning I went through
military exercises, and practiced on horseback. Well, one morning during
the summer, it being very hot, I went to sleep in the hall. Nothing, up
to that period, except the respect paid me, had enlightened me, or even
roused my suspicions. I lived as children, as birds, as plants, as the
air and the sun do. I had just turned my fifteenth year--”

“This, then, is eight years ago?”

“Yes, nearly; but I have ceased to reckon time.”

“Excuse me; but what did your tutor tell you, to encourage you to work?”

“He used to say that a man was bound to make for himself, in the world,
that fortune which Heaven had refused him at his birth. He added that,
being a poor, obscure orphan, I had no one but myself to look to; and
that nobody either did, or ever would, take any interest in me. I
was, then, in the hall I have spoken of, asleep from fatigue with long
fencing. My preceptor was in his room on the first floor, just over
me. Suddenly I heard him exclaim, and then he called: ‘Perronnette!
Perronnette!’ It was my nurse whom he called.”

“Yes, I know it,” said Aramis. “Continue, monseigneur.”

“Very likely she was in the garden; for my preceptor came hastily
downstairs. I rose, anxious at seeing him anxious. He opened the
garden-door, still crying out, ‘Perronnette! Perronnette!’ The windows
of the hall looked into the court; the shutters were closed; but through
a chink in them I saw my tutor draw near a large well, which was almost
directly under the windows of his study. He stooped over the brim,
looked into the well, and again cried out, and made wild and affrighted
gestures. Where I was, I could not only see, but hear--and see and hear
I did.”

“Go on, I pray you,” said Aramis.

“Dame Perronnette came running up, hearing the governor’s cries. He went
to meet her, took her by the arm, and drew her quickly towards the edge;
after which, as they both bent over it together, ‘Look, look,’ cried he,
‘what a misfortune!’

“‘Calm yourself, calm yourself,’ said Perronnette; ‘what is the matter?’

“‘The letter!’ he exclaimed; ‘do you see that letter?’ pointing to the
bottom of the well.

“‘What letter?’ she cried.

“‘The letter you see down there; the last letter from the queen.’

“At this word I trembled. My tutor--he who passed for my father, he who
was continually recommending me modesty and humility--in correspondence
with the queen!

“‘The queen’s last letter!’ cried Perronnette, without showing more
astonishment than at seeing this letter at the bottom of the well; ‘but
how came it there?’

“‘A chance, Dame Perronnette--a singular chance. I was entering my room,
and on opening the door, the window, too, being open, a puff of air came
suddenly and carried off this paper--this letter of her majesty’s; I
darted after it, and gained the window just in time to see it flutter a
moment in the breeze and disappear down the well.’

“‘Well,’ said Dame Perronnette; ‘and if the letter has fallen into the
well, ‘tis all the same as if it was burnt; and as the queen burns all
her letters every time she comes--’

“And so you see this lady who came every month was the queen,” said the
prisoner.

“‘Doubtless, doubtless,’ continued the old gentleman; ‘but this letter
contained instructions--how can I follow them?’

“‘Write immediately to her; give her a plain account of the accident,
and the queen will no doubt write you another letter in place of this.’

“‘Oh! the queen would never believe the story,’ said the good gentleman,
shaking his head; ‘she will imagine that I want to keep this letter
instead of giving it up like the rest, so as to have a hold over her.
She is so distrustful, and M. de Mazarin so--Yon devil of an Italian is
capable of having us poisoned at the first breath of suspicion.’”

Aramis almost imperceptibly smiled.

“‘You know, Dame Perronnette, they are both so suspicious in all that
concerns Philippe.’

“Philippe was the name they gave me,” said the prisoner.

“‘Well, ‘tis no use hesitating,’ said Dame Perronnette, ‘somebody must
go down the well.’

“‘Of course; so that the person who goes down may read the paper as he
is coming up.’

“‘But let us choose some villager who cannot read, and then you will be
at ease.’

“‘Granted; but will not any one who descends guess that a paper must be
important for which we risk a man’s life? However, you have given me
an idea, Dame Perronnette; somebody shall go down the well, but that
somebody shall be myself.’

“But at this notion Dame Perronnette lamented and cried in such a
manner, and so implored the old nobleman, with tears in her eyes, that
he promised her to obtain a ladder long enough to reach down, while she
went in search of some stout-hearted youth, whom she was to persuade
that a jewel had fallen into the well, and that this jewel was wrapped
in a paper. ‘And as paper,’ remarked my preceptor, ‘naturally unfolds
in water, the young man would not be surprised at finding nothing, after
all, but the letter wide open.’

“‘But perhaps the writing will be already effaced by that time,’ said
Dame Perronnette.

“‘No consequence, provided we secure the letter. On returning it to
the queen, she will see at once that we have not betrayed her; and
consequently, as we shall not rouse the distrust of Mazarin, we shall
have nothing to fear from him.’

“Having come to this resolution, they parted. I pushed back the shutter,
and, seeing that my tutor was about to re-enter, I threw myself on
my couch, in a confusion of brain caused by all I had just heard. My
governor opened the door a few moments after, and thinking I was asleep
gently closed it again. As soon as ever it was shut, I rose, and,
listening, heard the sound of retiring footsteps. Then I returned to the
shutters, and saw my tutor and Dame Perronnette go out together. I was
alone in the house. They had hardly closed the gate before I sprang from
the window and ran to the well. Then, just as my governor had leaned
over, so leaned I. Something white and luminous glistened in the green
and quivering silence of the water. The brilliant disk fascinated and
allured me; my eyes became fixed, and I could hardly breathe. The well
seemed to draw me downwards with its slimy mouth and icy breath; and I
thought I read, at the bottom of the water, characters of fire traced
upon the letter the queen had touched. Then, scarcely knowing what I was
about, and urged on by one of those instinctive impulses which drive
men to destruction, I lowered the cord from the windlass of the well to
within about three feet of the water, leaving the bucket dangling, at
the same time taking infinite pains not to disturb that coveted
letter, which was beginning to change its white tint for the hue of
chrysoprase,--proof enough that it was sinking,--and then, with the
rope weltering in my hands, slid down into the abyss. When I saw myself
hanging over the dark pool, when I saw the sky lessening above my head,
a cold shudder came over me, a chill fear got the better of me, I was
seized with giddiness, and the hair rose on my head; but my strong will
still reigned supreme over all the terror and disquietude. I gained
the water, and at once plunged into it, holding on by one hand, while I
immersed the other and seized the dear letter, which, alas! came in two
in my grasp. I concealed the two fragments in my body-coat, and, helping
myself with my feet against the sides of the pit, and clinging on with
my hands, agile and vigorous as I was, and, above all, pressed for time,
I regained the brink, drenching it as I touched it with the water that
streamed off me. I was no sooner out of the well with my prize, than I
rushed into the sunlight, and took refuge in a kind of shrubbery at
the bottom of the garden. As I entered my hiding-place, the bell which
resounded when the great gate was opened, rang. It was my preceptor come
back again. I had but just time. I calculated that it would take ten
minutes before he would gain my place of concealment, even if, guessing
where I was, he came straight to it; and twenty if he were obliged to
look for me. But this was time enough to allow me to read the cherished
letter, whose fragments I hastened to unite again. The writing was
already fading, but I managed to decipher it all.

“And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?” asked Aramis,
deeply interested.

“Quite enough, monsieur, to see that my tutor was a man of noble rank,
and that Perronnette, without being a lady of quality, was far better
than a servant; and also to perceived that I must myself be high-born,
since the queen, Anne of Austria, and Mazarin, the prime minister,
commended me so earnestly to their care.” Here the young man paused,
quite overcome.

“And what happened?” asked Aramis.

“It happened, monsieur,” answered he, “that the workmen they had
summoned found nothing in the well, after the closest search; that my
governor perceived that the brink was all watery; that I was not so
dried by the sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette spying that my garments
were moist; and, lastly, that I was seized with a violent fever, owing
to the chill and the excitement of my discovery, an attack of delirium
supervening, during which I related the whole adventure; so that, guided
by my avowal, my governor found the pieces of the queen’s letter inside
the bolster where I had concealed them.”

“Ah!” said Aramis, “now I understand.”

“Beyond this, all is conjecture. Doubtless the unfortunate lady and
gentleman, not daring to keep the occurrence secret, wrote of all this
to the queen and sent back the torn letter.”

“After which,” said Aramis, “you were arrested and removed to the
Bastile.”

“As you see.”

“Your two attendants disappeared?”

“Alas!”

“Let us not take up our time with the dead, but see what can be done
with the living. You told me you were resigned.”

“I repeat it.”

“Without any desire for freedom?”

“As I told you.”

“Without ambition, sorrow, or thought?”

The young man made no answer.

“Well,” asked Aramis, “why are you silent?”

“I think I have spoken enough,” answered the prisoner, “and that now it
is your turn. I am weary.”

Aramis gathered himself up, and a shade of deep solemnity spread itself
over his countenance. It was evident that he had reached the crisis in
the part he had come to the prison to play. “One question,” said Aramis.

“What is it? speak.”

“In the house you inhabited there were neither looking-glasses nor
mirrors?”

“What are those two words, and what is their meaning?” asked the young
man; “I have no sort of knowledge of them.”

“They designate two pieces of furniture which reflect objects; so that,
for instance, you may see in them your own lineaments, as you see mine
now, with the naked eye.”

“No; there was neither a glass nor a mirror in the house,” answered the
young man.

Aramis looked round him. “Nor is there anything of the kind here,
either,” he said; “they have again taken the same precaution.”

“To what end?”

“You will know directly. Now, you have told me that you were instructed
in mathematics, astronomy, fencing, and riding; but you have not said a
word about history.”

“My tutor sometimes related to me the principal deeds of the king, St.
Louis, King Francis I., and King Henry IV.”

“Is that all?”

“Very nearly.”

“This also was done by design, then; just as they deprived you of
mirrors, which reflect the present, so they left you in ignorance of
history, which reflects the past. Since your imprisonment, books have
been forbidden you; so that you are unacquainted with a number of facts,
by means of which you would be able to reconstruct the shattered mansion
of your recollections and your hopes.”

“It is true,” said the young man.

“Listen, then; I will in a few words tell you what has passed in France
during the last twenty-three or twenty-four years; that is, from the
probable date of your birth; in a word, from the time that interests
you.”

“Say on.” And the young man resumed his serious and attentive attitude.

“Do you know who was the son of Henry IV.?”

“At least I know who his successor was.”

“How?”

“By means of a coin dated 1610, which bears the effigy of Henry IV.; and
another of 1612, bearing that of Louis XIII. So I presumed that,
there being only two years between the two dates, Louis was Henry’s
successor.”

“Then,” said Aramis, “you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis
XIII.?”

“I do,” answered the youth, slightly reddening.

“Well, he was a prince full of noble ideas and great projects, always,
alas! deferred by the trouble of the times and the dread struggle that
his minister Richelieu had to maintain against the great nobles of
France. The king himself was of a feeble character, and died young and
unhappy.”

“I know it.”

“He had been long anxious about having a heir; a care which weighs
heavily on princes, who desire to leave behind them more than one pledge
that their best thoughts and works will be continued.”

“Did the king, then, die childless?” asked the prisoner, smiling.

“No, but he was long without one, and for a long while thought he should
be the last of his race. This idea had reduced him to the depths of
despair, when suddenly, his wife, Anne of Austria--”

The prisoner trembled.

“Did you know,” said Aramis, “that Louis XIII.’s wife was called Anne of
Austria?”

“Continue,” said the young man, without replying to the question.

“When suddenly,” resumed Aramis, “the queen announced an interesting
event. There was great joy at the intelligence, and all prayed for her
happy delivery. On the 5th of September, 1638, she gave birth to a son.”

Here Aramis looked at his companion, and thought he observed him turning
pale. “You are about to hear,” said Aramis, “an account which few indeed
could now avouch; for it refers to a secret which they imagined buried
with the dead, entombed in the abyss of the confessional.”

“And you will tell me this secret?” broke in the youth.

“Oh!” said Aramis, with unmistakable emphasis, “I do not know that I
ought to risk this secret by intrusting it to one who has no desire to
quit the Bastile.”

“I hear you, monsieur.”

“The queen, then, gave birth to a son. But while the court was rejoicing
over the event, when the king had shown the new-born child to the
nobility and people, and was sitting gayly down to table, to celebrate
the event, the queen, who was alone in her room, was again taken ill and
gave birth to a second son.”

“Oh!” said the prisoner, betraying a better acquaintance with affairs
than he had owned to, “I thought that Monsieur was only born in--”

Aramis raised his finger; “Permit me to continue,” he said.

The prisoner sighed impatiently, and paused.

“Yes,” said Aramis, “the queen had a second son, whom Dame Perronnette,
the midwife, received in her arms.”

“Dame Perronnette!” murmured the young man.

“They ran at once to the banqueting-room, and whispered to the king what
had happened; he rose and quitted the table. But this time it was no
longer happiness that his face expressed, but something akin to terror.
The birth of twins changed into bitterness the joy to which that of an
only son had given rise, seeing that in France (a fact you are assuredly
ignorant of) it is the oldest of the king’s sons who succeeds his
father.”

“I know it.”

“And that the doctors and jurists assert that there is ground for
doubting whether the son that first makes his appearance is the elder by
the law of heaven and of nature.”

The prisoner uttered a smothered cry, and became whiter than the
coverlet under which he hid himself.

“Now you understand,” pursued Aramis, “that the king, who with so much
pleasure saw himself repeated in one, was in despair about two; fearing
that the second might dispute the first’s claim to seniority, which had
been recognized only two hours before; and so this second son, relying
on party interests and caprices, might one day sow discord and engender
civil war throughout the kingdom; by these means destroying the very
dynasty he should have strengthened.”

“Oh, I understand!--I understand!” murmured the young man.

“Well,” continued Aramis; “this is what they relate, what they declare;
this is why one of the queen’s two sons, shamefully parted from his
brother, shamefully sequestered, is buried in profound obscurity; this
is why that second son has disappeared, and so completely, that not a
soul in France, save his mother, is aware of his existence.”

“Yes! his mother, who has cast him off,” cried the prisoner in a tone of
despair.

“Except, also,” Aramis went on, “the lady in the black dress; and,
finally, excepting--”

“Excepting yourself--is it not? You who come and relate all this; you,
who rouse in my soul curiosity, hatred, ambition, and, perhaps, even the
thirst of vengeance; except you, monsieur, who, if you are the man to
whom I expect, whom the note I have received applies to, whom, in short,
Heaven ought to send me, must possess about you--”

“What?” asked Aramis.

“A portrait of the king, Louis XIV., who at this moment reigns upon the
throne of France.”

“Here is the portrait,” replied the bishop, handing the prisoner a
miniature in enamel, on which Louis was depicted life-like, with a
handsome, lofty mien. The prisoner eagerly seized the portrait, and
gazed at it with devouring eyes.

“And now, monseigneur,” said Aramis, “here is a mirror.” Aramis left the
prisoner time to recover his ideas.

“So high!--so high!” murmured the young man, eagerly comparing the
likeness of Louis with his own countenance reflected in the glass.

“What do you think of it?” at length said Aramis.

“I think that I am lost,” replied the captive; “the king will never set
me free.”

“And I--I demand to know,” added the bishop, fixing his piercing eyes
significantly upon the prisoner, “I demand to know which of these two is
king; the one this miniature portrays, or whom the glass reflects?”

“The king, monsieur,” sadly replied the young man, “is he who is on
the throne, who is not in prison; and who, on the other hand, can cause
others to be entombed there. Royalty means power; and you behold how
powerless I am.”

“Monseigneur,” answered Aramis, with a respect he had not yet
manifested, “the king, mark me, will, if you desire it, be the one that,
quitting his dungeon, shall maintain himself upon the throne, on which
his friends will place him.”

“Tempt me not, monsieur,” broke in the prisoner bitterly.

“Be not weak, monseigneur,” persisted Aramis; “I have brought you all
the proofs of your birth; consult them; satisfy yourself that you are a
king’s son; it is for _us_ to act.”

“No, no; it is impossible.”

“Unless, indeed,” resumed the bishop ironically, “it be the destiny of
your race, that the brothers excluded from the throne should be always
princes void of courage and honesty, as was your uncle, M. Gaston
d’Orleans, who ten times conspired against his brother Louis XIII.”

“What!” cried the prince, astonished; “my uncle Gaston ‘conspired
against his brother’; conspired to dethrone him?”

“Exactly, monseigneur; for no other reason. I tell you the truth.”

“And he had friends--devoted friends?”

“As much so as I am to you.”

“And, after all, what did he do?--Failed!”

“He failed, I admit; but always through his own fault; and, for the
sake of purchasing--not his life--for the life of the king’s brother is
sacred and inviolable--but his liberty, he sacrificed the lives of all
his friends, one after another. And so, at this day, he is a very
blot on history, the detestation of a hundred noble families in this
kingdom.”

“I understand, monsieur; either by weakness or treachery, my uncle slew
his friends.”

“By weakness; which, in princes, is always treachery.”

“And cannot a man fail, then, from incapacity and ignorance? Do you
really believe it possible that a poor captive such as I, brought up,
not only at a distance from the court, but even from the world--do you
believe it possible that such a one could assist those of his friends
who should attempt to serve him?” And as Aramis was about to reply, the
young man suddenly cried out, with a violence which betrayed the temper
of his blood, “We are speaking of friends; but how can _I_ have any
friends--I, whom no one knows; and have neither liberty, money, nor
influence, to gain any?”

“I fancy I had the honor to offer myself to your royal highness.”

“Oh, do not style me so, monsieur; ‘tis either treachery or cruelty. Bid
me not think of aught beyond these prison-walls, which so grimly
confine me; let me again love, or, at least, submit to my slavery and my
obscurity.”

“Monseigneur, monseigneur; if you again utter these desperate words--if,
after having received proof of your high birth, you still remain
poor-spirited in body and soul, I will comply with your desire, I will
depart, and renounce forever the service of a master, to whom so eagerly
I came to devote my assistance and my life!”

“Monsieur,” cried the prince, “would it not have been better for you to
have reflected, before telling me all that you have done, that you have
broken my heart forever?”

“And so I desire to do, monseigneur.”

“To talk to me about power, grandeur, eye, and to prate of thrones! Is
a prison the fit place? You wish to make me believe in splendor, and we
are lying lost in night; you boast of glory, and we are smothering our
words in the curtains of this miserable bed; you give me glimpses of
power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer
in the corridor--that step which, after all, makes you tremble more than
it does me. To render me somewhat less incredulous, free me from the
Bastile; let me breathe the fresh air; give me my spurs and trusty
sword, then we shall begin to understand each other.”

“It is precisely my intention to give you all this, monseigneur, and
more; only, do you desire it?”

“A word more,” said the prince. “I know there are guards in every
gallery, bolts to every door, cannon and soldiery at every barrier.
How will you overcome the sentries--spike the guns? How will you break
through the bolts and bars?”

“Monseigneur,--how did you get the note which announced my arrival to
you?”

“You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note.”

“If we can corrupt one turnkey, we can corrupt ten.”

“Well; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from
the Bastile; possible so to conceal him that the king’s people shall
not again ensnare him; possible, in some unknown retreat, to sustain the
unhappy wretch in some suitable manner.”

“Monseigneur!” said Aramis, smiling.

“I admit that, whoever would do this much for me, would seem more than
mortal in my eyes; but as you tell me I am a prince, brother of the
king, how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my
brother have deprived me of? And as, to effect this, I must pass a
life of war and hatred, how can you cause me to prevail in those
combats--render me invulnerable by my enemies? Ah! monsieur, reflect on
all this; place me, to-morrow, in some dark cavern at a mountain’s base;
yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river, plain
and valley, of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens, or the
stormy sky, and it is enough. Promise me no more than this, for, indeed,
more you cannot give, and it would be a crime to deceive me, since you
call yourself my friend.”

Aramis waited in silence. “Monseigneur,” he resumed, after a moment’s
reflection, “I admire the firm, sound sense which dictates your words; I
am happy to have discovered my monarch’s mind.”

“Again, again! oh, God! for mercy’s sake,” cried the prince, pressing
his icy hands upon his clammy brow, “do not play with me! I have no need
to be a king to be the happiest of men.”

“But I, monseigneur, wish you to be a king for the good of humanity.”

“Ah!” said the prince, with fresh distrust inspired by the word; “ah!
with what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?”

“I forgot to say, monseigneur, that if you would allow me to guide you,
and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom,
you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to
the success of your cause, and these friends are numerous.”

“Numerous?”

“Less numerous than powerful, monseigneur.”

“Explain yourself.”

“It is impossible; I will explain, I swear before Heaven, on that day
that I see you sitting on the throne of France.”

“But my brother?”

“You shall decree his fate. Do you pity him?”

“Him, who leaves me to perish in a dungeon? No, no. For him I have no
pity!”

“So much the better.”

“He might have himself come to this prison, have taken me by the hand,
and have said, ‘My brother, Heaven created us to love, not to contend
with one another. I come to you. A barbarous prejudice has condemned you
to pass your days in obscurity, far from mankind, deprived of every joy.
I will make you sit down beside me; I will buckle round your waist our
father’s sword. Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put
down or restrain me? Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?’ ‘Oh!
never,’ I would have replied to him, ‘I look on you as my preserver,
I will respect you as my master. You give me far more than Heaven
bestowed; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving
and being loved in this world.’”

“And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?”

“On my life! While now--now that I have guilty ones to punish--”

“In what manner, monseigneur?”

“What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my
brother?”

“I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which
the king ought to have heeded; I say that your mother committed a
crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature
created so startlingly alike, of her own flesh, and I conclude that the
object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium.”

“By which you mean--”

“That if I restore you to your place on your brother’s throne, he shall
take yours in prison.”

“Alas! there’s such infinity of suffering in prison, especially it would
be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment.”

“Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire; and
if it seems good to you, after punishment, you will have it in your
power to pardon.”

“Good. And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?”

“Tell me, my prince.”

“It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the
Bastile.”

“I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the
pleasure of seeing you once again.”

“And when?”

“The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls.”

“Heavens! how will you give me notice of it?”

“By myself coming to fetch you.”

“Yourself?”

“My prince, do not leave this chamber save with me, or if in my absence
you are compelled to do so, remember that I am not concerned in it.”

“And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever, save to
you?”

“Save only to me.” Aramis bowed very low. The prince offered his hand.

“Monsieur,” he said, in a tone that issued from his heart, “one word
more, my last. If you have sought me for my destruction; if you are only
a tool in the hands of my enemies; if from our conference, in which
you have sounded the depths of my mind, anything worse than captivity
result, that is to say, if death befall me, still receive my blessing,
for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the
tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long, weary years.”

“Monseigneur, wait the results ere you judge me,” said Aramis.

“I say that, in such a case, I bless and forgive you. If, on the other
hand, you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of
fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven; if by your means I
am enabled to live in the memory of man, and confer luster on my race by
deeds of valor, or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people; if, from
my present depths of sorrow, aided by your generous hand, I raise myself
to the very height of honor, then to you, whom I thank with blessings,
to you will I offer half my power and my glory: though you would still
be but partly recompensed, and your share must always remain incomplete,
since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands.”

“Monseigneur,” replied Aramis, moved by the pallor and excitement of
the young man, “the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and
admiration. It is not you who will have to thank me, but rather the
nation whom you will render happy, the posterity whose name you will
make glorious. Yes; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than
life, I shall have given you immortality.”

The prince offered his hand to Aramis, who sank upon his knee and kissed
it.

“It is the first act of homage paid to our future king,” said he. “When
I see you again, I shall say, ‘Good day, sire.’”

“Till then,” said the young man, pressing his wan and wasted fingers
over his heart,--“till then, no more dreams, no more strain on my
life--my heart would break! Oh, monsieur, how small is my prison--how
low the window--how narrow are the doors! To think that so much pride,
splendor, and happiness, should be able to enter in and to remain here!”

“Your royal highness makes me proud,” said Aramis, “since you infer it
is I who brought all this.” And he rapped immediately on the door.
The jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux, who, devoured by fear and
uneasiness, was beginning, in spite of himself, to listen at the door.
Happily, neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice,
even in the most passionate outbreaks.

“What a confessor!” said the governor, forcing a laugh; “who would
believe that a compulsory recluse, a man as though in the very jaws of
death, could have committed crimes so numerous, and so long to tell of?”

Aramis made no reply. He was eager to leave the Bastile, where the
secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls.
As soon as they reached Baisemeaux’s quarters, “Let us proceed to
business, my dear governor,” said Aramis.

“Alas!” replied Baisemeaux.

“You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand
livres,” said the bishop.

“And to pay over the first third of the sum,” added the poor governor,
with a sigh, taking three steps towards his iron strong-box.

“Here is the receipt,” said Aramis.

“And here is the money,” returned Baisemeaux, with a threefold sigh.

“The order instructed me only to give a receipt; it said nothing about
receiving the money,” rejoined Aramis. “Adieu, monsieur le governeur!”

And he departed, leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with
joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the
confessor extraordinary to the Bastile.



Chapter II. How Mouston Had Become Fatter without Giving Porthos Notice
Thereof, and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy
Gentleman.

Since the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D’Artagnan were
seldom together. One was occupied with harassing duties for the king,
the other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended
to forward to his estate, and by aid of which he hoped to establish in
his various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed
in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty’s society. D’Artagnan,
ever faithful, one morning during an interval of service thought about
Porthos, and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a
fortnight, directed his steps towards his hotel, and pounced upon him
just as he was getting up. The worthy baron had a pensive--nay,
more than pensive--melancholy air. He was sitting on his bed, only
half-dressed, and with legs dangling over the edge, contemplating a host
of garments, which with their fringes, lace, embroidery, and slashes
of ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over the floor. Porthos, sad and
reflective as La Fontaine’s hare, did not observe D’Artagnan’s entrance,
which was, moreover, screened at this moment by M. Mouston, whose
personal corpulency, quite enough at any time to hide one man from
another, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant
was holding up for his master’s inspection, by the sleeves, that he
might the better see it all over. D’Artagnan stopped at the threshold
and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then, as the sight of the
innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the
bosom of that excellent gentleman, D’Artagnan thought it time to put
an end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of announcing
himself.

“Ah!” exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; “ah! ah!
Here is D’Artagnan. I shall then get hold of an idea!”

At these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out
of the way, smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus
found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented
his reaching D’Artagnan. Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in
rising, and crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face
with his friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection
that seemed to increase with every day. “Ah!” he repeated, “you are
always welcome, dear friend; but just now you are more welcome than
ever.”

“But you seem to have the megrims here!” exclaimed D’Artagnan.

Porthos replied by a look expressive of dejection. “Well, then, tell me
all about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is a secret.”

“In the first place,” returned Porthos, “you know I have no secrets from
you. This, then, is what saddens me.”

“Wait a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of
satin and velvet!”

“Oh, never mind,” said Porthos, contemptuously; “it is all trash.”

“Trash, Porthos! Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell! gorgeous satin!
regal velvet!”

“Then you think these clothes are--”

“Splendid, Porthos, splendid! I’ll wager that you alone in France have
so many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were to live to
be a hundred years of age, which wouldn’t astonish me in the very least,
you could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being
obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.”

Porthos shook his head.

“Come, my friend,” said D’Artagnan, “this unnatural melancholy in you
frightens me. My dear Porthos, pray get it out, then. And the sooner the
better.”

“Yes, my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.”

“Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux?”

“No: they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the
estimate.”

“Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?”

“No, my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock
all the pools in the neighborhood.”

“Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?”

“No, my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning
a hundred paces from the chateau, and a fountain sprung up in a place
entirely destitute of water.”

“What in the world _is_ the matter, then?”

“The fact is, I have received an invitation for the _fete_ at Vaux,”
 said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.

“Well! do you complain of that? The king has caused a hundred mortal
heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations. And so, my
dear friend, you are really going to Vaux?”

“Indeed I am!”

“You will see a magnificent sight.”

“Alas! I doubt it, though.”

“Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there!”

“Ah!” cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.

“Eh! good heavens, are you ill?” cried D’Artagnan.

“I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf! It isn’t that.”

“But what is it, then?”

“‘Tis that I have no clothes!”

D’Artagnan stood petrified. “No clothes! Porthos, no clothes!” he cried,
“when I see at least fifty suits on the floor.”

“Fifty, truly; but not one which fits me!”

“What? not one that fits you? But are you not measured, then, when you
give an order?”

“To be sure he is,” answered Mouston; “but unfortunately _I_ have gotten
stouter!”

“What! _you_ stouter!”

“So much so that I am now bigger than the baron. Would you believe it,
monsieur?”

“_Parbleu!_ it seems to me that is quite evident.”

“Do you see, stupid?” said Porthos, “that is quite evident!”

“Be still, my dear Porthos,” resumed D’Artagnan, becoming slightly
impatient, “I don’t understand why your clothes should not fit you,
because Mouston has grown stouter.”

“I am going to explain it,” said Porthos. “You remember having related
to me the story of the Roman general Antony, who had always seven wild
boars kept roasting, each cooked up to a different point; so that he
might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask
for it. Well, then, I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to
court to spend a week, I resolved to have always seven suits ready for
the occasion.”

“Capitally reasoned, Porthos--only a man must have a fortune like yours
to gratify such whims. Without counting the time lost in being measured,
the fashions are always changing.”

“That is exactly the point,” said Porthos, “in regard to which I
flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device.”

“Tell me what it is; for I don’t doubt your genius.”

“You remember what Mouston once was, then?”

“Yes; when he used to call himself Mousqueton.”

“And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?”

“No, not exactly. I beg your pardon, my good Mouston.”

“Oh! you are not in fault, monsieur,” said Mouston, graciously. “You
were in Paris, and as for us, we were at Pierrefonds.”

“Well, well, my dear Porthos; there was a time when Mouston began to
grow fat. Is that what you wished to say?”

“Yes, my friend; and I greatly rejoice over the period.”

“Indeed, I believe you do,” exclaimed D’Artagnan.

“You understand,” continued Porthos, “what a world of trouble it spared
for me.”

“No, I don’t--by any means.”

“Look here, my friend. In the first place, as you have said, to be
measured is a loss of time, even though it occur only once a fortnight.
And then, one may be travelling; and then you wish to have seven suits
always with you. In short, I have a horror of letting any one take my
measure. Confound it! either one is a nobleman or not. To be scrutinized
and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you, by inch and
line--‘tis degrading! Here, they find you too hollow; there, too
prominent. They recognize your strong and weak points. See, now, when we
leave the measurer’s hands, we are like those strongholds whose angles
and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy.”

“In truth, my dear Porthos, you possess ideas entirely original.”

“Ah! you see when a man is an engineer--”

“And has fortified Belle-Isle--‘tis natural, my friend.”

“Well, I had an idea, which would doubtless have proved a good one, but
for Mouston’s carelessness.”

D’Artagnan glanced at Mouston, who replied by a slight movement of his
body, as if to say, “You will see whether I am at all to blame in all
this.”

“I congratulated myself, then,” resumed Porthos, “at seeing Mouston get
fat; and I did all I could, by means of substantial feeding, to make him
stout--always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth,
and could then be measured in my stead.”

“Ah!” cried D’Artagnan. “I see--that spared you both time and
humiliation.”

“Consider my joy when, after a year and a half’s judicious feeding--for
I used to feed him up myself--the fellow--”

“Oh! I lent a good hand myself, monsieur,” said Mouston, humbly.

“That’s true. Consider my joy when, one morning, I perceived Mouston was
obliged to squeeze in, as I once did myself, to get through the little
secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of
the late Madame du Vallon, in the chateau of Pierrefonds. And, by the
way, about that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know
everything, why these wretches of architects, who ought to have the
compasses run into them, just to remind them, came to make doorways
through which nobody but thin people can pass?”

“Oh, those doors,” answered D’Artagnan, “were meant for gallants, and
they have generally slight and slender figures.”

“Madame du Vallon had no gallant!” answered Porthos, majestically.

“Perfectly true, my friend,” resumed D’Artagnan; “but the architects
were probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of
your marrying again.”

“Ah! that is possible,” said Porthos. “And now I have received an
explanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow, let us
return to the subject of Mouston’s fatness. But see how the two things
apply to each other. I have always noticed that people’s ideas run
parallel. And so, observe this phenomenon, D’Artagnan. I was talking to
you of Mouston, who is fat, and it led us on to Madame du Vallon--”

“Who was thin?”

“Hum! Is it not marvelous?”

“My dear friend, a _savant_ of my acquaintance, M. Costar, has made the
same observation as you have, and he calls the process by some Greek
name which I forget.”

“What! my remark is not then original?” cried Porthos, astounded. “I
thought I was the discoverer.”

“My friend, the fact was known before Aristotle’s days--that is to say,
nearly two thousand years ago.”

“Well, well, ‘tis no less true,” said Porthos, delighted at the idea of
having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest
sages of antiquity.

“Wonderfully--but suppose we return to Mouston. It seems to me, we have
left him fattening under our very eyes.”

“Yes, monsieur,” said Mouston.

“Well,” said Porthos, “Mouston fattened so well, that he gratified all
my hopes, by reaching my standard; a fact of which I was well able to
convince myself, by seeing the rascal, one day, in a waistcoat of mine,
which he had turned into a coat--a waistcoat, the mere embroidery of
which was worth a hundred pistoles.”

“‘Twas only to try it on, monsieur,” said Mouston.

“From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my
tailors, and to have him measured instead of myself.”

“A capital idea, Porthos; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than
you.”

“Exactly! They measured him down to the ground, and the end of the skirt
came just below my knee.”

“What a marvelous man you are, Porthos! Such a thing could happen only
to you.”

“Ah! yes; pay your compliments; you have ample grounds to go upon. It
was exactly at that time--that is to say, nearly two years and a half
ago--that I set out for Belle-Isle, instructing Mouston (so as always
to have, in every event, a pattern of every fashion) to have a coat made
for himself every month.”

“And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions? Ah! that was
anything but right, Mouston.”

“No, monsieur, quite the contrary; quite the contrary!”

“No, he never forgot to have his coats made; but he forgot to inform me
that he had got stouter!”

“But it was not my fault, monsieur! your tailor never told me.”

“And this to such an extent, monsieur,” continued Porthos, “that the
fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth, and so my last
dozen coats are all too large, from a foot to a foot and a half.”

“But the rest; those which were made when you were of the same size?”

“They are no longer the fashion, my dear friend. Were I to put them on,
I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam; and as though I had been
two years away from court.”

“I understand your difficulty. You have how many new suits?
nine? thirty-six? and yet not one to wear. Well, you must have a
thirty-seventh made, and give the thirty-six to Mouston.”

“Ah! monsieur!” said Mouston, with a gratified air. “The truth is, that
monsieur has always been very generous to me.”

“Do you mean to insinuate that I hadn’t that idea, or that I was
deterred by the expense? But it wants only two days to the _fete_; I
received the invitation yesterday; made Mouston post hither with my
wardrobe, and only this morning discovered my misfortune; and from now
till the day after to-morrow, there isn’t a single fashionable tailor
who will undertake to make me a suit.”

“That is to say, one covered all over with gold, isn’t it?”

“I wish it so! undoubtedly, all over.”

“Oh, we shall manage it. You won’t leave for three days. The invitations
are for Wednesday, and this is only Sunday morning.”

“‘Tis true; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four
hours beforehand.”

“How, Aramis?”

“Yes, it was Aramis who brought me the invitation.”

“Ah! to be sure, I see. You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet?”

“By no means! by the king, dear friend. The letter bears the following
as large as life: ‘M. le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has
condescended to place him on the invitation list--’”

“Very good; but you leave with M. Fouquet?”

“And when I think,” cried Porthos, stamping on the floor, “when I think
I shall have no clothes, I am ready to burst with rage! I should like to
strangle somebody or smash something!”

“Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything, Porthos; I will manage it
all; put on one of your thirty-six suits, and come with me to a tailor.”

“Pooh! my agent has seen them all this morning.”

“Even M. Percerin?”

“Who is M. Percerin?”

“Oh! only the king’s tailor!”

“Oh, ah, yes,” said Porthos, who wished to appear to know the king’s
tailor, but now heard his name mentioned for the first time; “to M.
Percerin’s, by Jove! I was afraid he would be too busy.”

“Doubtless he will be; but be at ease, Porthos; he will do for me
what he wouldn’t do for another. Only you must allow yourself to be
measured!”

“Ah!” said Porthos, with a sigh, “‘tis vexatious, but what would you
have me do?”

“Do? As others do; as the king does.”

“What! do they measure the king, too? does he put up with it?”

“The king is a beau, my good friend, and so are you, too, whatever you
may say about it.”

Porthos smiled triumphantly. “Let us go to the king’s tailor,” he said;
“and since he measures the king, I think, by my faith, I may do worse
than allow him to measure _me!_”



Chapter III. Who Messire Jean Percerin Was.

The king’s tailor, Messire Jean Percerin, occupied a rather large house
in the Rue St. Honore, near the Rue de l’Arbre Sec. He was a man
of great taste in elegant stuffs, embroideries, and velvets, being
hereditary tailor to the king. The preferment of his house reached as
far back as the time of Charles IX.; from whose reign dated, as we know,
fancy in _bravery_ difficult enough to gratify. The Percerin of that
period was a Huguenot, like Ambrose Pare, and had been spared by the
Queen of Navarre, the beautiful Margot, as they used to write and say,
too, in those days; because, in sooth, he was the only one who could
make for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear,
seeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical
defects, which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal.
Percerin being saved, made, out of gratitude, some beautiful black
bodices, very inexpensively indeed, for Queen Catherine, who ended by
being pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people, on whom she had
long looked with detestation. But Percerin was a very prudent man;
and having heard it said that there was no more dangerous sign for a
Protestant than to be smiled up on by Catherine, and having observed
that her smiles were more frequent than usual, he speedily turned
Catholic with all his family; and having thus become irreproachable,
attained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of France.
Under Henry III., gay king as he was, this position was as grand as the
height of one of the loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras. Now Percerin had
been a clever man all his life, and by way of keeping up his reputation
beyond the grave, took very good care not to make a bad death of it, and
so contrived to die very skillfully; and that at the very moment he felt
his powers of invention declining. He left a son and a daughter, both
worthy of the name they were called upon to bear; the son, a cutter as
unerring and exact as the square rule; the daughter, apt at embroidery,
and at designing ornaments. The marriage of Henry IV. and Marie de
Medici, and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen,
together with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere, king of the
_beaux_ of the period, made the fortune of the second generation of
Percerins. M. Concino Concini, and his wife Galligai, who subsequently
shone at the French court, sought to Italianize the fashion, and
introduced some Florentine tailors; but Percerin, touched to the
quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem, entirely defeated these
foreigners, and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his
compatriots, and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would
never employ any other, and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day
that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre.

And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin’s workshop, which the
Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human
body it contained. Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown
Percerin, the king, Louis XIII., had the generosity to bear no malice to
his tailor, and to retain him in his service. At the time that Louis the
Just afforded this great example of equity, Percerin had brought up two
sons, one of whom made his _debut_ at the marriage of Anne of Austria,
invented that admirable Spanish costume, in which Richelieu danced a
saraband, made the costumes for the tragedy of “Mirame,” and stitched
on to Buckingham’s mantle those famous pearls which were destined to
be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre. A man becomes easily
notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham, a M. de
Cinq-Mars, a Mademoiselle Ninon, a M. de Beaufort, and a Marion de
Lorme. And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory
when his father died. This same Percerin III., old, famous and wealthy,
yet further dressed Louis XIV.; and having no son, which was a great
cause of sorrow to him, seeing that with himself his dynasty would end,
he had brought up several hopeful pupils. He possessed a carriage,
a country house, men-servants the tallest in Paris; and by special
authority from Louis XIV., a pack of hounds. He worked for MM. de Lyonne
and Letellier, under a sort of patronage; but politic man as he was, and
versed in state secrets, he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert. This
is beyond explanation; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition.
Great geniuses of every kind live on unseen, intangible ideas; they act
without themselves knowing why. The great Percerin (for, contrary to
the rule of dynasties, it was, above all, the last of the Percerins who
deserved the name of Great), the great Percerin was inspired when he cut
a robe for the queen, or a coat for the king; he could mount a mantle
for Monsieur, the clock of a stocking for Madame; but, in spite of his
supreme talent, he could never hit off anything approaching a creditable
fit for M. Colbert. “That man,” he used often to say, “is beyond my art;
my needle can never dot him down.” We need scarcely say that Percerin
was M. Fouquet’s tailor, and that the superintendent highly esteemed
him. M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old, nevertheless still fresh,
and at the same time so dry, the courtiers used to say, that he was
positively brittle. His renown and his fortune were great enough for
M. le Prince, that king of fops, to take his arm when talking over the
fashions; and for those least eager to pay never to dare to leave their
accounts in arrear with him; for Master Percerin would for the first
time make clothes upon credit, but the second never, unless paid for the
former order.

It is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown, instead of
running after customers, made difficulties about obliging any fresh
ones. And so Percerin declined to fit _bourgeois_, or those who had but
recently obtained patents of nobility. A story used to circulate that
even M. de Mazarin, in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full
suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal, one fine day slipped letters
of nobility into his pocket.

It was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D’Artagnan
took the despairing Porthos; who, as they were going along, said to his
friend, “Take care, my good D’Artagnan, not to compromise the dignity
of a man such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin, who will, I
expect, be very impertinent; for I give you notice, my friend, that if
he is wanting in respect I will infallibly chastise him.”

“Presented by me,” replied D’Artagnan, “you have nothing to fear, even
though you were what you are not.”

“Ah! ‘tis because--”

“What? Have you anything against Percerin, Porthos?”

“I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name.”

“And then?”

“The fellow refused to supply me.”

“Oh, a misunderstanding, no doubt, which it will be now exceedingly easy
to set right. Mouston must have made a mistake.”

“Perhaps.”

“He has confused the names.”

“Possibly. That rascal Mouston never can remember names.”

“I will take it all upon myself.”

“Very good.”

“Stop the carriage, Porthos; here we are.”

“Here! how here? We are at the Halles; and you told me the house was at
the corner of the Rue de l’Arbre Sec.”

“‘Tis true, but look.”

“Well, I do look, and I see--”

“What?”

“_Pardieu!_ that we are at the Halles!”

“You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the
carriage in front of us?”

“No.”

“Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of
it. Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or
forty others which have arrived before us.”

“No, you are right, indeed. What a number of people! And what are they
all about?”

“‘Tis very simple. They are waiting their turn.”

“Bah! Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their
quarters?”

“No; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin’s house.”

“And we are going to wait too?”

“Oh, we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud.”

“What are we to do, then?”

“Get down, pass through the footmen and lackeys, and enter the tailor’s
house, which I will answer for our doing, if you go first.”

“Come along, then,” said Porthos.

They accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the
establishment. The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin’s doors
were closed, while a servant, standing before them, was explaining to
the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M.
Percerin could not receive anybody. It was bruited about outside still,
on the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom
he favored, in confidence, that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes
for the king, and that, owing to the urgency of the case, he was
meditating in his office on the ornaments, colors, and cut of these five
suits. Some, contented with this reason, went away again, contented
to repeat the tale to others, but others, more tenacious, insisted
on having the doors opened, and among these last three Blue Ribbons,
intended to take parts in a ballet, which would inevitably fail unless
the said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great
Percerin himself. D’Artagnan, pushing on Porthos, who scattered the
groups of people right and left, succeeded in gaining the counter,
behind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer
queries. (We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put
off Porthos like the rest, but D’Artagnan, showing himself, pronounced
merely these words, “The king’s order,” and was let in with his friend.)
The poor fellows had enough to do, and did their best, to reply to the
demands of the customers in the absence of their master, leaving
off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence; and when wounded pride, or
disappointed expectation, brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke,
he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter.
The line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture. Our
captain of musketeers, a man of sure and rapid observation, took it all
in at a glance; and having run over the groups, his eye rested on a man
in front of him. This man, seated upon a stool, scarcely showed his head
above the counter that sheltered him. He was about forty years of age,
with a melancholy aspect, pale face, and soft luminous eyes. He was
looking at D’Artagnan and the rest, with his chin resting upon his hand,
like a calm and inquiring amateur. Only on perceiving, and doubtless
recognizing, our captain, he pulled his hat down over his eyes. It was
this action, perhaps, that attracted D’Artagnan’s attention. If so,
the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect entirely
different from what he had desired. In other respects his costume was
plain, and his hair evenly cut enough for customers, who were not close
observers, to take him for a mere tailor’s apprentice, perched behind
the board, and carefully stitching cloth or velvet. Nevertheless, this
man held up his head too often to be very productively employed with his
fingers. D’Artagnan was not deceived,--not he; and he saw at once that
if this man was working at anything, it certainly was not at velvet.

“Eh!” said he, addressing this man, “and so you have become a tailor’s
boy, Monsieur Moliere!”

“Hush, M. d’Artagnan!” replied the man, softly, “you will make them
recognize me.”

“Well, and what harm?”

“The fact is, there is no harm, but--”

“You were going to say there is no good in doing it either, is it not
so?”

“Alas! no; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures.”

“Go on--go on, Monsieur Moliere. I quite understand the interest you
take in the plates--I will not disturb your studies.”

“Thank you.”

“But on one condition; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is.”

“Oh! willingly; in his own room. Only--”

“Only that one can’t enter it?”

“Unapproachable.”

“For everybody?”

“Everybody. He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my
observations, and then he went away.”

“Well, my dear Monsieur Moliere, but you will go and tell him I am
here.”

“I!” exclaimed Moliere, in the tone of a courageous dog, from which
you snatch the bone it has legitimately gained; “I disturb myself! Ah!
Monsieur d’Artagnan, how hard you are upon me!”

“If you don’t go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here, my dear
Moliere,” said D’Artagnan, in a low tone, “I warn you of one thing: that
I won’t exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me.”

Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture, “This gentleman,
is it not?”

“Yes.”

Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds
and hearts of men. The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one,
for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber.



Chapter IV. The Patterns.

During all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away, leaving at
every angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace, as the waves
leave foam or scattered seaweed on the sands, when they retire with the
ebbing tide. In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared, making another
sign to D’Artagnan from under the hangings. The latter hurried after
him, with Porthos in the rear, and after threading a labyrinth of
corridors, introduced him to M. Percerin’s room. The old man, with his
sleeves turned up, was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered
brocade, so as the better to exhibit its luster. Perceiving D’Artagnan,
he put the silk aside, and came to meet him, by no means radiant with
joy, and by no means courteous, but, take it altogether, in a tolerably
civil manner.

“The captain of the king’s musketeers will excuse me, I am sure, for I
am engaged.”

“Eh! yes, on the king’s costumes; I know that, my dear Monsieur
Percerin. You are making three, they tell me.”

“Five, my dear sir, five.”

“Three or five, ‘tis all the same to me, my dear monsieur; and I know
that you will make them most exquisitely.”

“Yes, I know. Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world,
I do not deny it; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word,
they must first be made; and to do this, captain, I am pressed for
time.”

“Oh, bah! there are two days yet; ‘tis much more than you require,
Monsieur Percerin,” said D’Artagnan, in the coolest possible manner.

Percerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be
contradicted, even in his whims; but D’Artagnan did not pay the least
attention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume.

“My dear M. Percerin,” he continued, “I bring you a customer.”

“Ah! ah!” exclaimed Percerin, crossly.

“M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,” continued
D’Artagnan. Percerin attempted a bow, which found no favor in the eyes
of the terrible Porthos, who, from his first entry into the room, had
been regarding the tailor askance.

“A very good friend of mine,” concluded D’Artagnan.

“I will attend to monsieur,” said Percerin, “but later.”

“Later? but when?”

“When I have time.”

“You have already told my valet as much,” broke in Porthos,
discontentedly.

“Very likely,” said Percerin; “I am nearly always pushed for time.”

“My friend,” returned Porthos, sententiously, “there is always time to
be found when one chooses to seek it.”

Percerin turned crimson; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by
age.

“Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere.”

“Come, come, Percerin,” interposed D’Artagnan, “you are not in a good
temper to-day. Well, I will say one more word to you, which will bring
you on your knees; monsieur is not only a friend of mine, but more, a
friend of M. Fouquet’s.”

“Ah! ah!” exclaimed the tailor, “that is another thing.” Then turning
to Porthos, “Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent?” he
inquired.

“I am attached to myself,” shouted Porthos, at the very moment that the
tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue. Moliere
was all observation, D’Artagnan laughed, Porthos swore.

“My dear Percerin,” said D’Artagnan, “you will make a dress for the
baron. ‘Tis I who ask you.”

“To you I will not say nay, captain.”

“But that is not all; you will make it for him at once.”

“‘Tis impossible within eight days.”

“That, then, is as much as to refuse, because the dress is wanted for
the _fete_ at Vaux.”

“I repeat that it is impossible,” returned the obstinate old man.

“By no means, dear Monsieur Percerin, above all if _I_ ask you,” said a
mild voice at the door, a silvery voice which made D’Artagnan prick up
his ears. It was the voice of Aramis.

“Monsieur d’Herblay!” cried the tailor.

“Aramis,” murmured D’Artagnan.

“Ah! our bishop!” said Porthos.

“Good morning, D’Artagnan; good morning, Porthos; good-morning, my dear
friends,” said Aramis. “Come, come, M. Percerin, make the baron’s
dress; and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet.” And he
accompanied the words with a sign, which seemed to say, “Agree, and
dismiss them.”

It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior
even to D’Artagnan’s, for the tailor bowed in assent, and turning round
upon Porthos, said, “Go and get measured on the other side.”

Porthos colored in a formidable manner. D’Artagnan saw the storm coming,
and addressing Moliere, said to him, in an undertone, “You see before
you, my dear monsieur, a man who considers himself disgraced, if you
measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him; study this type
for me, Master Aristophanes, and profit by it.”

Moliere had no need of encouragement, and his gaze dwelt long and keenly
on the Baron Porthos. “Monsieur,” he said, “if you will come with me, I
will make them take your measure without touching you.”

“Oh!” said Porthos, “how do you make that out, my friend?”

“I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of
your dress. It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of
quality, who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch
them. We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being
measured, a process which, as I think, wounds the natural dignity of a
man; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these--”

“_Corboeuf!_ I believe I am too!”

“Well, that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence, and you shall
have the benefit of our invention.”

“But how in the world can it be done?” asked Porthos, delighted.

“Monsieur,” said Moliere, bowing, “if you will deign to follow me, you
will see.”

Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes. Perhaps he fancied from
D’Artagnan’s liveliness that he would leave with Porthos, so as not to
lose the conclusion of a scene well begun. But, clear-sighted as he was,
Aramis deceived himself. Porthos and Moliere left together: D’Artagnan
remained with Percerin. Why? From curiosity, doubtless; probably to
enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis. As Moliere
and Porthos disappeared, D’Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes, a
proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him.

“A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?”

Aramis smiled. “No,” said he.

“You will go to Vaux, however?”

“I shall go, but without a new dress. You forget, dear D’Artagnan, that
a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every
_fete_.”

“Bah!” said the musketeer, laughing, “and do we write no more poems now,
either?”

“Oh! D’Artagnan,” exclaimed Aramis, “I have long ago given up all such
tomfoolery.”

“True,” repeated D’Artagnan, only half convinced. As for Percerin, he
was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades.

“Don’t you perceive,” said Aramis, smiling, “that we are greatly boring
this good gentleman, my dear D’Artagnan?”

“Ah! ah!” murmured the musketeer, aside; “that is, I am boring you,
my friend.” Then aloud, “Well, then, let us leave; I have no further
business here, and if you are as disengaged as I, Aramis--”

“No, not I--I wished--”

“Ah! you had something particular to say to M. Percerin? Why did you not
tell me so at once?”

“Something particular, certainly,” repeated Aramis, “but not for you,
D’Artagnan. But, at the same time, I hope you will believe that I can
never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not
hear it.”

“Oh, no, no! I am going,” said D’Artagnan, imparting to his voice an
evident tone of curiosity; for Aramis’s annoyance, well dissembled as it
was, had not a whit escaped him; and he knew that, in that impenetrable
mind, every thing, even the most apparently trivial, was designed to
some end; an unknown one, but an end that, from the knowledge he had of
his friend’s character, the musketeer felt must be important.

On his part, Aramis saw that D’Artagnan was not without suspicion, and
pressed him. “Stay, by all means,” he said, “this is what it is.” Then
turning towards the tailor, “My dear Percerin,” said he,--“I am even
very happy that you are here, D’Artagnan.”

“Oh, indeed,” exclaimed the Gascon, for the third time, even less
deceived this time than before.

Percerin never moved. Aramis roused him violently, by snatching from his
hands the stuff upon which he was engaged. “My dear Percerin,” said he,
“I have, near hand, M. Lebrun, one of M. Fouquet’s painters.”

“Ah, very good,” thought D’Artagnan; “but why Lebrun?”

Aramis looked at D’Artagnan, who seemed to be occupied with an engraving
of Mark Antony. “And you wish that I should make him a dress, similar to
those of the Epicureans?” answered Percerin. And while saying this, in
an absent manner, the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of
brocade.

“An Epicurean’s dress?” asked D’Artagnan, in a tone of inquiry.

“I see,” said Aramis, with a most engaging smile, “it is written that
our dear D’Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening. Yes,
friend, you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet’s Epicureans, have you
not?”

“Undoubtedly. Is it not a kind of poetical society, of which La
Fontaine, Loret, Pelisson, and Moliere are members, and which holds its
sittings at Saint-Mande?”

“Exactly so. Well, we are going to put our poets in uniform, and enroll
them in a regiment for the king.”

“Oh, very well, I understand; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for
the king. Be at ease; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun, I will not
mention it.”

“Always agreeable, my friend. No, Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with
this part of it; the secret which concerns him is far more important
than the other.”

“Then, if it is so important as all that, I prefer not to know it,” said
D’Artagnan, making a show of departure.

“Come in, M. Lebrun, come in,” said Aramis, opening a side-door with his
right hand, and holding back D’Artagnan with his left.

“I’faith, I too, am quite in the dark,” quoth Percerin.

Aramis took an “opportunity,” as is said in theatrical matters.

“My dear M. de Percerin,” Aramis continued, “you are making five dresses
for the king, are you not? One in brocade; one in hunting-cloth; one in
velvet; one in satin; and one in Florentine stuffs.”

“Yes; but how--do you know all that, monseigneur?” said Percerin,
astounded.

“It is all very simple, my dear monsieur; there will be a hunt, a
banquet, concert, promenade and reception; these five kinds of dress are
required by etiquette.”

“You know everything, monseigneur!”

“And a thing or two in addition,” muttered D’Artagnan.

“But,” cried the tailor, in triumph, “what you do not know,
monseigneur--prince of the church though you are--what nobody will
know--what only the king, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and myself do
know, is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments, and the
cut, the _ensemble_, the finish of it all!”

“Well,” said Aramis, “that is precisely what I have come to ask you,
dear Percerin.”

“Ah, bah!” exclaimed the tailor, terrified, though Aramis had pronounced
these words in his softest and most honeyed tones. The request appeared,
on reflection, so exaggerated, so ridiculous, so monstrous to M.
Percerin that first he laughed to himself, then aloud, and finished
with a shout. D’Artagnan followed his example, not because he found the
matter so “very funny,” but in order not to allow Aramis to cool.

“At the outset, I appear to be hazarding an absurd question, do I not?”
 said Aramis. “But D’Artagnan, who is incarnate wisdom itself, will tell
you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this.”

“Let us see,” said the attentive musketeer; perceiving with his
wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now, and
that the hour of battle was approaching.

“Let us see,” said Percerin, incredulously.

“Why, now,” continued Aramis, “does M. Fouquet give the king a
_fete?_--Is it not to please him?”

“Assuredly,” said Percerin. D’Artagnan nodded assent.

“By delicate attentions? by some happy device? by a succession of
surprises, like that of which we were talking?--the enrolment of our
Epicureans.”

“Admirable.”

“Well, then; this is the surprise we intend. M. Lebrun here is a man who
draws most excellently.”

“Yes,” said Percerin; “I have seen his pictures, and observed that his
dresses were highly elaborated. That is why I at once agreed to make him
a costume--whether to agree with those of the Epicureans, or an original
one.”

“My dear monsieur, we accept your offer, and shall presently avail
ourselves of it; but just now, M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses
you will make for himself, but of those you are making for the king.”

Percerin made a bound backwards, which D’Artagnan--calmest and most
appreciative of men, did not consider overdone, so many strange and
startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded. “The
king’s dresses! Give the king’s dresses to any mortal whatever! Oh!
for once, monseigneur, your grace is mad!” cried the poor tailor in
extremity.

“Help me now, D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, more and more calm and smiling.
“Help me now to persuade monsieur, for _you_ understand; do you not?”

“Eh! eh!--not exactly, I declare.”

“What! you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king
the surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux; and that
the portrait, which be a striking resemblance, ought to be dressed
exactly as the king will be on the day it is shown?”

“Oh! yes, yes,” said the musketeer, nearly convinced, so plausible was
this reasoning. “Yes, my dear Aramis, you are right; it is a happy idea.
I will wager it is one of your own, Aramis.”

“Well, I don’t know,” replied the bishop; “either mine or M. Fouquet’s.”
 Then scanning Percerin, after noticing D’Artagnan’s hesitation, “Well,
Monsieur Percerin,” he asked, “what do you say to this?”

“I say, that--”

“That you are, doubtless, free to refuse. I know well--and I by no means
count upon compelling you, my dear monsieur. I will say more, I even
understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet’s
idea; you dread appearing to flatter the king. A noble spirit, M.
Percerin, a noble spirit!” The tailor stammered. “It would, indeed, be a
very pretty compliment to pay the young prince,” continued Aramis; “but
as the surintendant told me, ‘if Percerin refuse, tell him that it
will not at all lower him in my opinion, and I shall always esteem him,
only--’”

“‘Only?’” repeated Percerin, rather troubled.

“‘Only,’” continued Aramis, “‘I shall be compelled to say to the
king,’--you understand, my dear Monsieur Percerin, that these are M.
Fouquet’s words,--‘I shall be constrained to say to the king, “Sire, I
had intended to present your majesty with your portrait, but owing to a
feeling of delicacy, slightly exaggerated perhaps, although creditable,
M. Percerin opposed the project.”’”

“Opposed!” cried the tailor, terrified at the responsibility which would
weigh upon him; “I to oppose the desire, the will of M. Fouquet when he
is seeking to please the king! Oh, what a hateful word you have uttered,
monseigneur. Oppose! Oh, ‘tis not I who said it, Heaven have mercy on
me. I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it! Is it not true,
Monsieur d’Artagnan, that I have opposed nothing?”

D’Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral. He
felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it, whether comedy or
tragedy; he was at his wit’s end at not being able to fathom it, but in
the meanwhile wished to keep clear.

But already Percerin, goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he
stood in the way of a pleasant surprise, had offered Lebrun a chair, and
proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses, the
fifth being still in the workmen’s hands; and these masterpieces he
successively fitted upon four lay figures, which, imported into France
in the time of Concini, had been given to Percerin II. by Marshal
d’Onore, after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their
competition. The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the
dresses. But Aramis, who was closely watching all the phases of his
toil, suddenly stopped him.

“I think you have not quite got it, my dear Lebrun,” he said; “your
colors will deceive you, and on canvas we shall lack that exact
resemblance which is absolutely requisite. Time is necessary for
attentively observing the finer shades.”

“Quite true,” said Percerin, “but time is wanting, and on that head, you
will agree with me, monseigneur, I can do nothing.”

“Then the affair will fail,” said Aramis, quietly, “and that because of
a want of precision in the colors.”

Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with
the closest fidelity--a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed
impatience.

“What in the world, now, is the meaning of this imbroglio?” the
musketeer kept saying to himself.

“That will never do,” said Aramis: “M. Lebrun, close your box, and roll
up your canvas.”

“But, monsieur,” cried the vexed painter, “the light is abominable
here.”

“An idea, M. Lebrun, an idea! If we had a pattern of the materials, for
example, and with time, and a better light--”

“Oh, then,” cried Lebrun, “I would answer for the effect.”

“Good!” said D’Artagnan, “this ought to be the knotty point of the whole
thing; they want a pattern of each of the materials. _Mordioux!_ Will
this Percerin give in now?”

Percerin, beaten from his last retreat, and duped, moreover, by the
feigned good-nature of Aramis, cut out five patterns and handed them to
the bishop of Vannes.

“I like this better. That is your opinion, is it not?” said Aramis to
D’Artagnan.

“My dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, “my opinion is that you are always
the same.”

“And, consequently, always your friend,” said the bishop in a charming
tone.

“Yes, yes,” said D’Artagnan, aloud; then, in a low voice, “If I am your
dupe, double Jesuit that you are, I will not be your accomplice; and
to prevent it, ‘tis time I left this place.--Adieu, Aramis,” he added
aloud, “adieu; I am going to rejoin Porthos.”

“Then wait for me,” said Aramis, pocketing the patterns, “for I have
done, and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend.”

Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes, Percerin put back the dresses
into the closet, Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the
patterns were secure,--and they all left the study.



Chapter V. Where, Probably, Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the
Bourgeois Gentilhomme.

D’Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber; but no longer an
irritated Porthos, or a disappointed Porthos, but Porthos radiant,
blooming, fascinating, and chattering with Moliere, who was looking
upon him with a species of idolatry, and as a man would who had not only
never seen anything greater, but not even ever anything so great. Aramis
went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand, which lost
itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend,--an operation which
Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness. But the friendly
pressure having been performed not too painfully for him, the bishop of
Vannes passed over to Moliere.

“Well, monsieur,” said he, “will you come with me to Saint-Mande?”

“I will go anywhere you like, monseigneur,” answered Moliere.

“To Saint-Mande!” cried Porthos, surprised at seeing the proud bishop
of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor. “What, Aramis, are you
going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande?”

“Yes,” said Aramis, smiling, “our work is pressing.”

“And besides, my dear Porthos,” continued D’Artagnan, “M. Moliere is not
altogether what he seems.”

“In what way?” asked Porthos.

“Why, this gentleman is one of M. Percerin’s chief clerks, and is
expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has
ordered for the Epicureans.”

“‘Tis precisely so,” said Moliere.

“Yes, monsieur.”

“Come, then, my dear M. Moliere,” said Aramis, “that is, if you have
done with M. du Vallon.”

“We have finished,” replied Porthos.

“And you are satisfied?” asked D’Artagnan.

“Completely so,” replied Porthos.

Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony, and grasped the
hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him.

“Pray, monsieur,” concluded Porthos, mincingly, “above all, be exact.”

“You will have your dress the day after to-morrow, monsieur le baron,”
 answered Moliere. And he left with Aramis.

Then D’Artagnan, taking Porthos’s arm, “What has this tailor done for
you, my dear Porthos,” he asked, “that you are so pleased with him?”

“What has he done for me, my friend! done for me!” cried Porthos,
enthusiastically.

“Yes, I ask you, what has he done for you?”

“My friend, he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished: he
has taken my measure without touching me!”

“Ah, bah! tell me how he did it.”

“First, then, they went, I don’t know where, for a number of lay
figures, of all heights and sizes, hoping there would be one to suit
mine, but the largest--that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard--was
two inches too short, and a half foot too narrow in the chest.”

“Indeed!”

“It is exactly as I tell you, D’Artagnan; but he is a great man, or at
the very least a great tailor, is this M. Moliere. He was not at all put
at fault by the circumstance.”

“What did he do, then?”

“Oh! it is a very simple matter. I’faith, ‘tis an unheard-of thing that
people should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method
from the first. What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared
me!”

“Not to mention of the costumes, my dear Porthos.”

“Yes, thirty dresses.”

“Well, my dear Porthos, come, tell me M. Moliere’s plan.”

“Moliere? You call him so, do you? I shall make a point of recollecting
his name.”

“Yes; or Poquelin, if you prefer that.”

“No; I like Moliere best. When I wish to recollect his name, I shall
think of _voliere_ [an aviary]; and as I have one at Pierrefonds--”

“Capital!” returned D’Artagnan. “And M. Moliere’s plan?”

“‘Tis this: instead of pulling me to pieces, as all these rascals
do--of making me bend my back, and double my joints--all of them low and
dishonorable practices--” D’Artagnan made a sign of approbation with
his head. “‘Monsieur,’ he said to me,” continued Porthos, “‘a gentleman
ought to measure himself. Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass;’
and I drew near the glass. I must own I did not exactly understand what
this good M. Voliere wanted with me.”

“Moliere!”

“Ah! yes, Moliere--Moliere. And as the fear of being measured still
possessed me, ‘Take care,’ said I to him, ‘what you are going to do with
me; I am very ticklish, I warn you.’ But he, with his soft voice (for
he is a courteous fellow, we must admit, my friend), he with his soft
voice, ‘Monsieur,’ said he, ‘that your dress may fit you well, it must
be made according to your figure. Your figure is exactly reflected in
this mirror. We shall take the measure of this reflection.’”

“In fact,” said D’Artagnan, “you saw yourself in the glass; but where
did they find one in which you could see your whole figure?”

“My good friend, it is the very glass in which the king is used to look
to see himself.”

“Yes; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are.”

“Ah! well, I know not how that may be; it is, no doubt, a cunning way
of flattering the king; but the looking-glass was too large for me.
‘Tis true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of
glass, placed one above another, and its breadth of three similar
parallelograms in juxtaposition.”

“Oh, Porthos! what excellent words you have command of. Where in the
word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?”

“At Belle-Isle. Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic
studies and castramentative experiments.”

D’Artagnan recoiled, as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked
the breath out of his body.

“Ah! very good. Let us return to the looking-glass, my friend.”

“Then, this good M. Voliere--”

“Moliere.”

“Yes--Moliere--you are right. You will see now, my dear friend, that I
shall recollect his name quite well. This excellent M. Moliere set to
work tracing out lines on the mirror, with a piece of Spanish chalk,
following in all the make of my arms and my shoulders, all the while
expounding this maxim, which I thought admirable: ‘It is advisable that
a dress should not incommode its wearer.’”

“In reality,” said D’Artagnan, “that is an excellent maxim, which is,
unfortunately, seldom carried out in practice.”

“That is why I found it all the more astonishing, when he expatiated
upon it.”

“Ah! he expatiated?”

“_Parbleu!_”

“Let me hear his theory.”

“‘Seeing that,’ he continued, ‘one may, in awkward circumstances, or in
a troublesome position, have one’s doublet on one’s shoulder, and not
desire to take one’s doublet off--’”

“True,” said D’Artagnan.

“‘And so,’ continued M. Voliere--”

“Moliere.”

“Moliere, yes. ‘And so,’ went on M. Moliere, ‘you want to draw your
sword, monsieur, and you have your doublet on your back. What do you
do?’

“‘I take it off,’ I answered.

“‘Well, no,’ he replied.

“‘How no?’

“‘I say that the dress should be so well made, that it will in no way
encumber you, even in drawing your sword.’

“‘Ah, ah!’

“‘Throw yourself on guard,’ pursued he.

“I did it with such wondrous firmness, that two panes of glass burst out
of the window.

“‘’Tis nothing, nothing,’ said he. ‘Keep your position.’

“I raised my left arm in the air, the forearm gracefully bent, the
ruffle drooping, and my wrist curved, while my right arm, half extended,
securely covered my wrist with the elbow, and my breast with the wrist.”

“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “‘tis the true guard--the academic guard.”

“You have said the very word, dear friend. In the meanwhile, Voliere--”

“Moliere.”

“Hold! I should certainly, after all, prefer to call him--what did you
say his other name was?”

“Poquelin.”

“I prefer to call him Poquelin.”

“And how will you remember this name better than the other?”

“You understand, he calls himself Poquelin, does he not?”

“Yes.”

“If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard.”

“Good.”

“And change _Coc_ into _Poc_, _nard_ into _lin_; and instead of
Coquenard I shall have Poquelin.”

“‘Tis wonderful,” cried D’Artagnan, astounded. “Go on, my friend, I am
listening to you with admiration.”

“This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass.”

“I beg your pardon--Poquelin.”

“What did I say, then?”

“You said Coquelin.”

“Ah! true. This Poquelin, then, sketched my arm on the glass; but he
took his time over it; he kept looking at me a good deal. The fact is,
that I must have been looking particularly handsome.”

“‘Does it weary you?’ he asked.

“‘A little,’ I replied, bending a little in my hands, ‘but I could hold
out for an hour or so longer.’

“‘No, no, I will not allow it; the willing fellows will make it a duty
to support your arms, as of old, men supported those of the prophet.’

“‘Very good,’ I answered.

“‘That will not be humiliating to you?’

“‘My friend,’ said I, ‘there is, I think, a great difference between
being supported and being measured.’”

“The distinction is full of the soundest sense,” interrupted D’Artagnan.

“Then,” continued Porthos, “he made a sign: two lads approached; one
supported my left arm, while the other, with infinite address, supported
my right.”

“‘Another, my man,’ cried he. A third approached. ‘Support monsieur by
the waist,’ said he. The _garcon_ complied.”

“So that you were at rest?” asked D’Artagnan.

“Perfectly; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass.”

“Poquelin, my friend.”

“Poquelin--you are right. Stay, decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere.”

“Yes; and then it was over, wasn’t it?”

“During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror.”

“‘Twas delicate in him.”

“I much like the plan; it is respectful, and keeps every one in his
place.”

“And there it ended?”

“Without a soul having touched me, my friend.”

“Except the three _garcons_ who supported you.”

“Doubtless; but I have, I think, already explained to you the difference
there is between supporting and measuring.”

“‘Tis true,” answered D’Artagnan; who said afterwards to himself,
“I’faith, I greatly deceive myself, or I have been the means of a good
windfall to that rascal Moliere, and we shall assuredly see the scene
hit off to the life in some comedy or other.” Porthos smiled.

“What are you laughing at?” asked D’Artagnan.

“Must I confess? Well, I was laughing over my good fortune.”

“Oh, that is true; I don’t know a happier man than you. But what is this
last piece of luck that has befallen you?’

“Well, my dear fellow, congratulate me.”

“I desire nothing better.”

“It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that
manner.”

“Are you so sure of it?’

“Nearly so. Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere
and the other _garcons_ showed me the fact.”

“Well, my friend, that does not surprise me from Moliere,” said
D’Artagnan.

“Voliere, my friend.”

“Oh, no, no, indeed! I am very willing to leave you to go on saying
Voliere; but, as for me, I shall continued to say Moliere. Well, this,
I was saying, does not surprise me, coming from Moliere, who is a very
ingenious fellow, and inspired you with this grand idea.”

“It will be of great use to him by and by, I am sure.”

“Won’t it be of use to him, indeed? I believe you, it will, and that
in the highest degree;--for you see my friend Moliere is of all
known tailors the man who best clothes our barons, comtes, and
marquises--according to their measure.”

On this observation, neither the application nor depth of which we
shall discuss, D’Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin’s house and
rejoined their carriages, wherein we will leave them, in order to look
after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande.



Chapter VI. The Bee-Hive, the Bees, and the Honey.

The bishop of Vannes, much annoyed at having met D’Artagnan at M.
Percerin’s, returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor. Moliere,
on the other hand, quite delighted at having made such a capital rough
sketch, and at knowing where to find his original again, whenever he
should desire to convert his sketch into a picture, Moliere arrived in
the merriest of moods. All the first story of the left wing was occupied
by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris, and those on the freest
footing in the house--every one in his compartment, like the bees in
their cells, employed in producing the honey intended for that royal
cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV. during
the _fete_ at Vaux. Pelisson, his head leaning on his hand, was engaged
in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the “Facheux,” a comedy in
three acts, which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere, as
D’Artagnan called him, or Coquelin de Voliere, as Porthos styled him.
Loret, with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer,--the gazetteers
of all ages have always been so artless!--Loret was composing an
account of the _fetes_ at Vaux, before those _fetes_ had taken place.
La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other, a peripatetic,
absent-minded, boring, unbearable dreamer, who kept buzzing and humming
at everybody’s elbow a thousand poetic abstractions. He so often
disturbed Pelisson, that the latter, raising his head, crossly said, “At
least, La Fontaine, supply me with a rhyme, since you have the run of
the gardens at Parnassus.”

“What rhyme do you want?” asked the _Fabler_ as Madame de Sevigne used
to call him.

“I want a rhyme to _lumiere_.”

“_Orniere_,” answered La Fontaine.

“Ah, but, my good friend, one cannot talk of _wheel-ruts_ when
celebrating the delights of Vaux,” said Loret.

“Besides, it doesn’t rhyme,” answered Pelisson.

“What! doesn’t rhyme!” cried La Fontaine, in surprise.

“Yes; you have an abominable habit, my friend,--a habit which will ever
prevent your becoming a poet of the first order. You rhyme in a slovenly
manner.”

“Oh, oh, you think so, do you, Pelisson?”

“Yes, I do, indeed. Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one
can find a better.”

“Then I will never write anything again save in prose,” said La
Fontaine, who had taken up Pelisson’s reproach in earnest. “Ah! I often
suspected I was nothing but a rascally poet! Yes, ‘tis the very truth.”

“Do not say so; your remark is too sweeping, and there is much that is
good in your ‘Fables.’”

“And to begin,” continued La Fontaine, following up his idea, “I will go
and burn a hundred verses I have just made.”

“Where are your verses?”

“In my head.”

“Well, if they are in your head you cannot burn them.”

“True,” said La Fontaine; “but if I do not burn them--”

“Well, what will happen if you do not burn them?”

“They will remain in my mind, and I shall never forget them!”

“The deuce!” cried Loret; “what a dangerous thing! One would go mad with
it!”

“The deuce! the deuce!” repeated La Fontaine; “what can I do?”

“I have discovered the way,” said Moliere, who had entered just at this
point of the conversation.

“What way?”

“Write them first and burn them afterwards.”

“How simple! Well, I should never have discovered that. What a mind that
devil of a Moliere has!” said La Fontaine. Then, striking his forehead,
“Oh, thou wilt never be aught but an ass, Jean La Fontaine!” he added.

“_What_ are you saying there, my friend?” broke in Moliere, approaching
the poet, whose aside he had heard.

“I say I shall never be aught but an ass,” answered La Fontaine, with
a heavy sigh and swimming eyes. “Yes, my friend,” he added, with
increasing grief, “it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner.”

“Oh, ‘tis wrong to say so.”

“Nay, I am a poor creature!”

“Who said so?”

“_Parbleu!_ ‘twas Pelisson; did you not, Pelisson?”

Pelisson, again absorbed in his work, took good care not to answer.

“But if Pelisson said you were so,” cried Moliere, “Pelisson has
seriously offended you.”

“Do you think so?”

“Ah! I advise you, as you are a gentleman, not to leave an insult like
that unpunished.”

“_What!_” exclaimed La Fontaine.

“Did you ever fight?”

“Once only, with a lieutenant in the light horse.”

“What wrong had he done you?”

“It seems he ran away with my wife.”

“Ah, ah!” said Moliere, becoming slightly pale; but as, at La Fontaine’s
declaration, the others had turned round, Moliere kept upon his lips the
rallying smile which had so nearly died away, and continuing to make La
Fontaine speak--

“And what was the result of the duel?”

“The result was, that on the ground my opponent disarmed me, and then
made an apology, promising never again to set foot in my house.”

“And you considered yourself satisfied?” said Moliere.

“Not at all! on the contrary, I picked up my sword. ‘I beg your pardon,
monsieur,’ I said, ‘I have not fought you because you were my wife’s
friend, but because I was told I ought to fight. So, as I have never
known any peace save since you made her acquaintance, do me the pleasure
to continue your visits as heretofore, or _morbleu!_ let us set to
again.’ And so,” continued La Fontaine, “he was compelled to resume his
friendship with madame, and I continue to be the happiest of husbands.”

All burst out laughing. Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes.
Why? Perhaps to wipe away a tear, perhaps to smother a sigh. Alas! we
know that Moliere was a moralist, but he was not a philosopher. “‘Tis
all one,” he said, returning to the topic of the conversation, “Pelisson
has insulted you.”

“Ah, truly! I had already forgotten it.”

“And I am going to challenge him on your behalf.”

“Well, you can do so, if you think it indispensable.”

“I do think it indispensable, and I am going to--”

“Stay,” exclaimed La Fontaine, “I want your advice.”

“Upon what? this insult?”

“No; tell me really now whether _lumiere_ does not rhyme with
_orniere_.”

“I should make them rhyme.”

“Ah! I knew you would.”

“And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time.”

“A hundred thousand!” cried La Fontaine. “Four times as many as ‘La
Pucelle,’ which M. Chaplain is meditating. Is it also on this subject,
too, that you have composed a hundred thousand verses?”

“Listen to me, you eternally absent-minded creature,” said Moliere.

“It is certain,” continued La Fontaine, “that _legume_, for instance,
rhymes with _posthume_.”

“In the plural, above all.”

“Yes, above all in the plural, seeing that then it rhymes not with three
letters, but with four; as _orniere_ does with _lumiere_.”

“But give me _ornieres_ and _lumieres_ in the plural, my dear Pelisson,”
 said La Fontaine, clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend, whose
insult he had quite forgotten, “and they will rhyme.”

“Hem!” coughed Pelisson.

“Moliere says so, and Moliere is a judge of such things; he declares he
has himself made a hundred thousand verses.”

“Come,” said Moliere, laughing, “he is off now.”

“It is like _rivage_, which rhymes admirably with _herbage_. I would
take my oath of it.”

“But--” said Moliere.

“I tell you all this,” continued La Fontaine, “because you are preparing
a _divertissement_ for Vaux, are you not?”

“Yes, the ‘Facheux.’”

“Ah, yes, the ‘Facheux;’ yes, I recollect. Well, I was thinking a
prologue would admirably suit your _divertissement_.”

“Doubtless it would suit capitally.”

“Ah! you are of my opinion?”

“So much so, that I have asked you to write this very prologue.”

“You asked _me_ to write it?”

“Yes, you, and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson, who is
engaged upon it at this moment.”

“Ah! that is what Pelisson is doing, then? I’faith, my dear Moliere, you
are indeed often right.”

“When?”

“When you call me absent-minded. It is a monstrous defect; I will cure
myself of it, and do your prologue for you.”

“But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it!--”

“Ah, true, miserable rascal that I am! Loret was indeed right in saying
I was a poor creature.”

“It was not Loret who said so, my friend.”

“Well, then, whoever said so, ‘tis the same to me! And so your
_divertissement_ is called the ‘Facheux?’ Well, can you make _heureux_
rhyme with _facheux?_”

“If obliged, yes.”

“And even with _capriceux_.”

“Oh, no, no.”

“It would be hazardous, and yet why so?”

“There is too great a difference in the cadences.”

“I was fancying,” said La Fontaine, leaving Moliere for Loret--“I was
fancying--”

“What were you fancying?” said Loret, in the middle of a sentence. “Make
haste.”

“You are writing the prologue to the ‘Facheux,’ are you not?”

“No! _mordieu!_ it is Pelisson.”

“Ah, Pelisson,” cried La Fontaine, going over to him, “I was fancying,”
 he continued, “that the nymph of Vaux--”

“Ah, beautiful!” cried Loret. “The nymph of Vaux! thank you, La
Fontaine; you have just given me the two concluding verses of my paper.”

“Well, if you can rhyme so well, La Fontaine,” said Pelisson, “tell me
now in what way you would begin my prologue?”

“I should say, for instance, ‘Oh! nymph, who--’ After ‘who’ I should
place a verb in the second person singular of the present indicative;
and should go on thus: ‘this grot profound.’”

“But the verb, the verb?” asked Pelisson.

“To admire the greatest king of all kings round,” continued La Fontaine.

“But the verb, the verb,” obstinately insisted Pelisson. “This second
person singular of the present indicative?”

“Well, then; quittest:

“Oh, nymph, who quittest now this grot profound, To admire the greatest
king of all kings round.”

“You would not put ‘who quittest,’ would you?”

“Why not?”

“‘Quittest,’ after ‘you who’?”

“Ah! my dear fellow,” exclaimed La Fontaine, “you are a shocking
pedant!”

“Without counting,” said Moliere, “that the second verse, ‘king of all
kings round,’ is very weak, my dear La Fontaine.”

“Then you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature,--a shuffler, as
you said.”

“I never said so.”

“Then, as Loret said.”

“And it was not Loret either; it was Pelisson.”

“Well, Pelisson was right a hundred times over. But what annoys me more
than anything, my dear Moliere, is, that I fear we shall not have our
Epicurean dresses.”

“You expected yours, then, for the _fete?_”

“Yes, for the _fete_, and then for after the _fete_. My housekeeper told
me that my own is rather faded.”

“_Diable!_ your housekeeper is right; rather more than faded.”

“Ah, you see,” resumed La Fontaine, “the fact is, I left it on the floor
in my room, and my cat--”

“Well, your cat--”

“She made her nest upon it, which has rather changed its color.”

Moliere burst out laughing; Pelisson and Loret followed his example. At
this juncture, the bishop of Vannes appeared, with a roll of plans and
parchments under his arm. As if the angel of death had chilled all gay
and sprightly fancies--as if that wan form had scared away the Graces
to whom Xenocrates sacrificed--silence immediately reigned through the
study, and every one resumed his self-possession and his pen. Aramis
distributed the notes of invitation, and thanked them in the name of
M. Fouquet. “The superintendent,” he said, “being kept to his room by
business, could not come and see them, but begged them to send him some
of the fruits of their day’s work, to enable him to forget the fatigue
of his labor in the night.”

At these words, all settled down to work. La Fontaine placed himself at
a table, and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white
vellum; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue; Moliere contributed
fifty fresh verses, with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him;
Loret, an article on the marvelous _fetes_ he predicted; and Aramis,
laden with his booty like the king of the bees, that great black drone,
decked with purple and gold, re-entered his apartment, silent and
busy. But before departing, “Remember, gentlemen,” said he, “we leave
to-morrow evening.”

“In that case, I must give notice at home,” said Moliere.

“Yes; poor Moliere!” said Loret, smiling; “he loves his home.”

“‘_He_ loves,’ yes,” replied Moliere, with his sad, sweet smile. “‘He
loves,’ that does not mean, they love _him_.”

“As for me,” said La Fontaine, “they love me at Chateau Thierry, I am
very sure.”

Aramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance.

“Will any one go with me?” he asked. “I am going by Paris, after having
passed a quarter of an hour with M. Fouquet. I offer my carriage.”

“Good,” said Moliere, “I accept it. I am in a hurry.”

“I shall dine here,” said Loret. “M. de Gourville has promised me some
craw-fish.”

“He has promised me some whitings. Find a rhyme for that, La Fontaine.”

Aramis went out laughing, as only he could laugh, and Moliere followed
him. They were at the bottom of the stairs, when La Fontaine opened the
door, and shouted out:


“He has promised us some whitings, In return for these our writings.”

The shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis
opened the door of the study. As to Moliere, he had undertaken to
order the horses, while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the
superintendent. “Oh, how they are laughing there!” said Fouquet, with a
sigh.

“Do you not laugh, monseigneur?”

“I laugh no longer now, M. d’Herblay. The _fete_ is approaching; money
is departing.”

“Have I not told you that was my business?”

“Yes, you promised me millions.”

“You shall have them the day after the king’s _entree_ into Vaux.”

Fouquet looked closely at Aramis, and passed the back of his icy hand
across his moistened brow. Aramis perceived that the superintendent
either doubted him, or felt he was powerless to obtain the money. How
could Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop, ex-abbe, ex-musketeer, could
find any?

“Why doubt me?” said Aramis. Fouquet smiled and shook his head.

“Man of little faith!” added the bishop.

“My dear M. d’Herblay,” answered Fouquet, “if I fall--”

“Well; if you ‘fall’?”

“I shall, at least, fall from such a height, that I shall shatter myself
in falling.” Then giving himself a shake, as though to escape from
himself, “Whence came you,” said he, “my friend?”

“From Paris--from Percerin.”

“And what have you been doing at Percerin’s, for I suppose you attach no
great importance to our poets’ dresses?”

“No; I went to prepare a surprise.”

“Surprise?”

“Yes; which you are going to give to the king.”

“And will it cost much?”

“Oh! a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun.”

“A painting?--Ah! all the better! And what is this painting to
represent?”

“I will tell you; then at the same time, whatever you may say or think
of it, I went to see the dresses for our poets.”

“Bah! and they will be rich and elegant?”

“Splendid! There will be few great monseigneurs with so good. People
will see the difference there is between the courtiers of wealth and
those of friendship.”

“Ever generous and grateful, dear prelate.”

“In your school.”

Fouquet grasped his hand. “And where are you going?” he said.

“I am off to Paris, when you shall have given a certain letter.”

“For whom?”

“M. de Lyonne.”

“And what do you want with Lyonne?”

“I wish to make him sign a _lettre de cachet_.”

“‘_Lettre de cachet!_’ Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile?”

“On the contrary--to let somebody out.”

“And who?”

“A poor devil--a youth, a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years, for
two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits.”

“‘Two Latin verses!’ and, for ‘two Latin verses,’ the miserable being
has been in prison for ten years!”

“Yes!”

“And has committed no other crime?”

“Beyond this, he is as innocent as you or I.”

“On your word?”

“On my honor!”

“And his name is--”

“Seldon.”

“Yes.--But it is too bad. You knew this, and you never told me!”

“‘Twas only yesterday his mother applied to me, monseigneur.”

“And the woman is poor!”

“In the deepest misery.”

“Heaven,” said Fouquet, “sometimes bears with such injustice on earth,
that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence.
Stay, M. d’Herblay.” And Fouquet, taking a pen, wrote a few rapid lines
to his colleague Lyonne. Aramis took the letter and made ready to go.

“Wait,” said Fouquet. He opened his drawer, and took out ten government
notes which were there, each for a thousand francs. “Stay,” he said;
“set the son at liberty, and give this to the mother; but, above all, do
not tell her--”

“What, monseigneur?”

“That she is ten thousand livres richer than I. She would say I am but
a poor superintendent! Go! and I pray that God will bless those who are
mindful of his poor!”

“So also do I pray,” replied Aramis, kissing Fouquet’s hand.

And he went out quickly, carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the
notes for Seldon’s mother, and taking up Moliere, who was beginning to
lose patience.

Chapter VII. Another Supper at the Bastile.

Seven o’clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile, that famous
clock, which, like all the accessories of the state prison, the very use
of which is a torture, recalled to the prisoners’ minds the destination
of every hour of their punishment. The time-piece of the Bastile,
adorned with figures, like most of the clocks of the period, represented
St. Peter in bonds. It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives.
The doors, grating on their enormous hinges, opened for the passage of
the baskets and trays of provisions, the abundance and the delicacy of
which, as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us, was regulated by
the condition in life of the prisoner. We understand on this head
the theories of M. de Baisemeaux, sovereign dispenser of gastronomic
delicacies, head cook of the royal fortress, whose trays, full-laden,
were ascending the steep staircases, carrying some consolation to the
prisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages. This
same hour was that of M. le gouverneur’s supper also. He had a guest
to-day, and the spit turned more heavily than usual. Roast partridges,
flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret; boiled fowls; hams,
fried and sprinkled with white wine, _cardons_ of Guipuzcoa and _la
bisque ecrevisses_: these, together with soups and _hors d’oeuvres_,
constituted the governor’s bill of fare. Baisemeaux, seated at table,
was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes, who, booted
like a cavalier, dressed in gray and sword at side, kept talking of
his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience. M. de Baisemeaux de
Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness
my lord of Vannes, and this evening Aramis, becoming sprightly,
volunteered confidence on confidence. The prelate had again a little
touch of the musketeer about him. The bishop just trenched on the
borders only of license in his style of conversation. As for M. de
Baisemeaux, with the facility of vulgar people, he gave himself up
entirely upon this point of his guest’s freedom. “Monsieur,” said he,
“for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur.”

“By no means,” said Aramis; “call me monsieur; I am booted.”

“Do you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?”

“No! faith,” said Aramis, taking up his glass; “but I hope I remind you
of a capital guest.”

“You remind me of two, monsieur. Francois, shut the window; the wind may
annoy his greatness.”

“And let him go,” added Aramis. “The supper is completely served, and
we shall eat it very well without waiters. I like exceedingly to be
_tete-a-tete_ when I am with a friend.” Baisemeaux bowed respectfully.

“I like exceedingly,” continued Aramis, “to help myself.”

“Retire, Francois,” cried Baisemeaux. “I was saying that your greatness
puts me in mind of two persons; one very illustrious, the late cardinal,
the great Cardinal de la Rochelle, who wore boots like you.”

“Indeed,” said Aramis; “and the other?”

“The other was a certain musketeer, very handsome, very brave, very
adventurous, very fortunate, who, from being abbe, turned musketeer, and
from musketeer turned abbe.” Aramis condescended to smile. “From
abbe,” continued Baisemeaux, encouraged by Aramis’s smile--“from abbe,
bishop--and from bishop--”

“Ah! stay there, I beg,” exclaimed Aramis.

“I have just said, monsieur, that you gave me the idea of a cardinal.”

“Enough, dear M. Baisemeaux. As you said, I have on the boots of a
cavalier, but I do not intend, for all that, to embroil myself with the
church this evening.”

“But you have wicked intentions, nevertheless, monseigneur.”

“Oh, yes, wicked, I own, as everything mundane is.”

“You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?”

“In disguise, as you say.”

“And you still make use of your sword?”

“Yes, I should think so; but only when I am compelled. Do me the
pleasure to summon Francois.”

“Have you no wine there?”

“‘Tis not for wine, but because it is hot here, and the window is shut.”

“I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the
arrival of couriers.”

“Ah, yes. You hear them when the window is open?”

“But too well, and that disturbs me. You understand?”

“Nevertheless I am suffocated. Francois.” Francois entered. “Open the
windows, I pray you, Master Francois,” said Aramis. “You will allow him,
dear M. Baisemeaux?”

“You are at home here,” answered the governor. The window was opened.
“Do you not think,” said M. de Baisemeaux, “that you will find yourself
very lonely, now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at
Blois? He is a very old friend, is he not?”

“You know it as I do, Baisemeaux, seeing that you were in the musketeers
with us.”

“Bah! with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years.”

“And you are right. But I do more than love M. de la Fere, dear
Baisemeaux; I venerate him.”

“Well, for my part, though ‘tis singular,” said the governor, “I prefer
M. d’Artagnan to him. There is a man for you, who drinks long and well!
That kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts.”

“Baisemeaux, make me tipsy to-night; let us have a merry time of it as
of old, and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart, I promise
you, you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your
glass.”

“Bravo!” said Baisemeaux, and he poured out a great glass of wine and
drank it off at a draught, trembling with joy at the idea of being, by
hook or by crook, in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor.
While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was
noting the sounds in the great court. A courier came in about eight
o’clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle, and, although the
courier made a great noise, Baisemeaux heard nothing.

“The devil take him,” said Aramis.

“What! who?” asked Baisemeaux. “I hope ‘tis neither the wine you drank
nor he who is the cause of your drinking it.”

“No; it is a horse, who is making noise enough in the court for a whole
squadron.”

“Pooh! some courier or other,” replied the governor, redoubling his
attention to the passing bottle. “Yes; and may the devil take him, and
so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more. Hurrah! hurrah!”

“You forget me, Baisemeaux! my glass is empty,” said Aramis, lifting his
dazzling Venetian goblet.

“Upon my honor, you delight me. Francois, wine!” Francois entered.
“Wine, fellow! and better.”

“Yes, monsieur, yes; but a courier has just arrived.”

“Let him go to the devil, I say.”

“Yes, monsieur, but--”

“Let him leave his news at the office; we will see to it to-morrow.
To-morrow, there will be time to-morrow; there will be daylight,” said
Baisemeaux, chanting the words.

“Ah, monsieur,” grumbled the soldier Francois, in spite of himself,
“monsieur.”

“Take care,” said Aramis, “take care!”

“Of what? dear M. d’Herblay,” said Baisemeaux, half intoxicated.

“The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is
sometimes an order.”

“Nearly always.”

“Do not orders issue from the ministers?”

“Yes, undoubtedly; but--”

“And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the
king?”

“Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless, ‘tis very tiresome when you are
sitting before a good table, _tete-a-tete_ with a friend--Ah! I beg your
pardon, monsieur; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper, and that I
speak to a future cardinal.”

“Let us pass over that, dear Baisemeaux, and return to our soldier, to
Francois.”

“Well, and what has Francois done?”

“He has demurred!”

“He was wrong, then?”

“However, he _has_ demurred, you see; ‘tis because there is something
extraordinary in this matter. It is very possible that it was not
Francois who was wrong in demurring, but you, who are in the wrong in
not listening to him.”

“Wrong? I to be wrong before Francois? that seems rather hard.”

“Pardon me, merely an irregularity. But I thought it my duty to make an
observation which I deem important.”

“Oh! perhaps you are right,” stammered Baisemeaux. “The king’s order
is sacred; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper, I repeat
that the devil--”

“If you had said as much to the great cardinal--hem! my dear Baisemeaux,
and if his order had any importance.”

“I do it that I may not disturb a bishop. _Mordioux!_ am I not, then,
excusable?”

“Do not forget, Baisemeaux, that I have worn the soldier’s coat, and I
am accustomed to obedience everywhere.”

“You wish, then--”

“I wish that you would do your duty, my friend; yes, at least before
this soldier.”

“‘Tis mathematically true,” exclaimed Baisemeaux. Francois still
waited: “Let them send this order of the king’s up to me,” he repeated,
recovering himself. And he added in a low tone, “Do you know what it is?
I will tell you something about as interesting as this. ‘Beware of fire
near the powder magazine;’ or, ‘Look close after such and such a one,
who is clever at escaping,’ Ah! if you only knew, monseigneur, how many
times I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest, deepest
slumber, by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me, or
rather, bring me a slip of paper containing these words: ‘Monsieur de
Baisemeaux, what news?’ ‘Tis clear enough that those who waste their
time writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile. They would
know better; they have never considered the thickness of my walls, the
vigilance of my officers, the number of rounds we go. But, indeed, what
can you expect, monseigneur? It is their business to write and torment
me when I am at rest, and to trouble me when I am happy,” added
Baisemeaux, bowing to Aramis. “Then let them do their business.”

“And do you do yours,” added the bishop, smiling.

Francois re-entered; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister’s
order. He slowly undid it, and as slowly read it. Aramis pretended to
be drinking, so as to be able to watch his host through the glass. Then,
Baisemeaux, having read it: “What was I just saying?” he exclaimed.

“What is it?” asked the bishop.

“An order of release! There, now; excellent news indeed to disturb us!”

“Excellent news for him whom it concerns, you will at least agree, my
dear governor!”

“And at eight o’clock in the evening!”

“It is charitable!”

“Oh! charity is all very well, but it is for that fellow who says he
is so weary and tired, but not for me who am amusing myself,” said
Baisemeaux, exasperated.

“Will you lose by him, then? And is the prisoner who is to be set at
liberty a good payer?”

“Oh, yes, indeed! a miserable, five-franc rat!”

“Let me see it,” asked M. d’Herblay. “It is no indiscretion?”

“By no means; read it.”

“There is ‘Urgent,’ on the paper; you have seen that, I suppose?”

“Oh, admirable! ‘Urgent!’--a man who has been there ten years! It
is _urgent_ to set him free to-day, this very evening, at eight
o’clock!--_urgent!_” And Baisemeaux, shrugging his shoulders with an air
of supreme disdain, flung the order on the table and began eating again.

“They are fond of these tricks!” he said, with his mouth full; “they
seize a man, some fine day, keep him under lock and key for ten years,
and write to you, ‘Watch this fellow well,’ or ‘Keep him very strictly.’
And then, as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a
dangerous man, all of a sudden, without rhyme or reason they write--‘Set
him at liberty,’ and actually add to their missive--‘urgent.’ You will
own, my lord, ‘tis enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders!”

“What do you expect? It is for them to write,” said Aramis, “for you to
execute the order.”

“Good! good! execute it! Oh, patience! You must not imagine that I am a
slave.”

“Gracious Heaven! my very good M. Baisemeaux, who ever said so? Your
independence is well known.”

“Thank Heaven!”

“But your goodness of heart is also known.”

“Ah! don’t speak of it!”

“And your obedience to your superiors. Once a soldier, you see,
Baisemeaux, always a soldier.”

“And I shall directly obey; and to-morrow morning, at daybreak, the
prisoner referred to shall be set free.”

“To-morrow?”

“At dawn.”

“Why not this evening, seeing that the _lettre de cachet_ bears, both on
the direction and inside, ‘_urgent_’?”

“Because this evening we are at supper, and our affairs are urgent,
too!”

“Dear Baisemeaux, booted though I be, I feel myself a priest, and
charity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst. This
unfortunate man has suffered long enough, since you have just told me
that he has been your prisoner these ten years. Abridge his suffering.
His good time has come; give him the benefit quickly. God will repay you
in Paradise with years of felicity.”

“You wish it?”

“I entreat you.”

“What! in the very middle of our repast?”

“I implore you; such an action is worth ten Benedicites.”

“It shall be as you desire, only our supper will get cold.”

“Oh! never heed that.”

Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois, and by a very natural
motion turned round towards the door. The order had remained on the
table; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to
change the paper for another, folded in the same manner, which he drew
swiftly from his pocket. “Francois,” said the governor, “let the major
come up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere.” Francois bowed and
quitted the room, leaving the two companions alone.



Chapter VIII. The General of the Order.

There was now a brief silence, during which Aramis never removed his
eyes from Baisemeaux for a moment. The latter seemed only half decided
to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper, and it was clear he was
trying to invent some pretext, whether good or bad, for delay, at any
rate till after dessert. And it appeared also that he had hit upon an
excuse at last.

“Eh! but it is impossible!” he cried.

“How impossible?” said Aramis. “Give me a glimpse of this
impossibility.”

“‘Tis impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour. Where can
he go to, a man so unacquainted with Paris?”

“He will find a place wherever he can.”

“You see, now, one might as well set a blind man free!”

“I have a carriage, and will take him wherever he wishes.”

“You have an answer for everything. Francois, tell monsieur le major to
go and open the cell of M. Seldon, No. 3, Bertaudiere.”

“Seldon!” exclaimed Aramis, very naturally. “You said Seldon, I think?”

“I said Seldon, of course. ‘Tis the name of the man they set free.”

“Oh! you mean to say Marchiali?” said Aramis.

“Marchiali? oh! yes, indeed. No, no, Seldon.”

“I think you are making a mistake, Monsieur Baisemeaux.”

“I have read the order.”

“And I also.”

“And I saw ‘Seldon’ in letters as large as that,” and Baisemeaux held up
his finger.

“And I read ‘Marchiali’ in characters as large as this,” said Aramis,
also holding up two fingers.

“To the proof; let us throw a light on the matter,” said Baisemeaux,
confident he was right. “There is the paper, you have only to read it.”

“I read ‘Marchiali,’” returned Aramis, spreading out the paper. “Look.”

Baisemeaux looked, and his arms dropped suddenly. “Yes, yes,” he said,
quite overwhelmed; “yes, Marchiali. ‘Tis plainly written Marchiali!
Quite true!”

“Ah!--”

“How? the man of whom we have talked so much? The man whom they are
every day telling me to take such care of?”

“There is ‘Marchiali,’” repeated the inflexible Aramis.

“I must own it, monseigneur. But I understand nothing about it.”

“You believe your eyes, at any rate.”

“To tell me very plainly there is ‘Marchiali.’”

“And in a good handwriting, too.”

“‘Tis a wonder! I still see this order and the name of Seldon, Irishman.
I see it. Ah! I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of
ink.”

“No, there is no ink; no, there is no blot.”

“Oh! but there was, though; I know it, because I rubbed my finger--this
very one--in the powder that was over the blot.”

“In a word, be it how it may, dear M. Baisemeaux,” said Aramis, “and
whatever you may have seen, the order is signed to release Marchiali,
blot or no blot.”

“The order is signed to release Marchiali,” replied Baisemeaux,
mechanically, endeavoring to regain his courage.

“And you are going to release this prisoner. If your heart dictates you
to deliver Seldon also, I declare to you I will not oppose it the least
in the world.” Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile, the irony of
which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux’s confusion of mind, and restored
his courage.

“Monseigneur,” he said, “this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom
the other day a priest confessor of _our order_ came to visit in so
imperious and so secret a manner.”

“I don’t know that, monsieur,” replied the bishop.

“‘Tis no such long time ago, dear Monsieur d’Herblay.”

“It is true. But _with us_, monsieur, it is good that the man of to-day
should no longer know what the man of yesterday did.”

“In any case,” said Baisemeaux, “the visit of the Jesuit confessor must
have given happiness to this man.”

Aramis made no reply, but recommenced eating and drinking. As for
Baisemeaux, no longer touching anything that was on the table, he again
took up the order and examined it every way. This investigation, under
ordinary circumstances, would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis
burn with anger; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for
so little, above all, when he had murmured to himself that to do so was
dangerous. “Are you going to release Marchiali?” he said. “What mellow,
fragrant and delicious sherry this is, my dear governor.”

“Monseigneur,” replied Baisemeaux, “I shall release the prisoner
Marchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order, and
above all, when, by interrogating him, I have satisfied myself.”

“The order is sealed, and the courier is ignorant of the contents. What
do you want to satisfy yourself about?”

“Be it so, monseigneur; but I shall send to the ministry, and M. de
Lyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order.”

“What is the good of all that?” asked Aramis, coldly.

“What good?”

“Yes; what is your object, I ask?”

“The object of never deceiving oneself, monseigneur; nor being wanting
in the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers, nor
infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one’s own free
will.”

“Very good; you have just spoken so eloquently, that I cannot but admire
you. It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors; he
is guilty when he deceives himself, and he should be punished if he
infringed either the duties or laws of his office.”

Baisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment.

“It follows,” pursued Aramis, “that you are going to ask advice, to put
your conscience at ease in the matter?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“And if a superior officer gives you orders, you will obey?”

“Never doubt it, monseigneur.”

“You know the king’s signature well, M. de Baisemeaux?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“Is it not on this order of release?”

“It is true, but it may--”

“Be forged, you mean?”

“That is evident, monseigneur.”

“You are right. And that of M. de Lyonne?”

“I see it plain enough on the order; but for the same reason that the
king’s signature may have been forged, so also, and with even greater
probability, may M. de Lyonne’s.”

“Your logic has the stride of a giant, M. de Baisemeaux,” said Aramis;
“and your reasoning is irresistible. But on what special grounds do you
base your idea that these signatures are false?”

“On this: the absence of counter-signatures. Nothing checks his
majesty’s signature; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has
signed.”

“Well, Monsieur de Baisemeaux,” said Aramis, bending an eagle glance on
the governor, “I adopt so frankly your doubts, and your mode of clearing
them up, that I will take a pen, if you will give me one.”

Baisemeaux gave him a pen.

“And a sheet of white paper,” added Aramis.

Baisemeaux handed him some paper.

“Now, I--I, also--I, here present--incontestably, I--am going to write
an order to which I am certain you will give credence, incredulous as
you are!”

Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner. It seemed to
him that the voice of the bishop’s, but just now so playful and gay, had
become funereal and sad; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of
a mortuary chapel, the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood.

Aramis took a pen and wrote. Baisemeaux, in terror, read over his
shoulder.

“A. M. D. G.,” wrote the bishop; and he drew a cross under these four
letters, which signify _ad majorem Dei gloriam_, “to the greater glory
of God;” and thus he continued: “It is our pleasure that the order
brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor, for the king, of
the castle of the Bastile, be held by him good and effectual, and be
immediately carried into operation.”

(Signed) D’HERBLAY

“General of the Order, by the grace of God.”

Baisemeaux was so profoundly astonished, that his features remained
contracted, his lips parted, and his eyes fixed. He did not move an
inch, nor articulate a sound. Nothing could be heard in that large
chamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth, which was fluttering to
its death about the candles. Aramis, without even deigning to look at
the man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition, drew from his
pocket a small case of black wax; he sealed the letter, and stamped it
with a seal suspended at his breast, beneath his doublet, and when the
operation was concluded, presented--still in silence--the missive to M.
de Baisemeaux. The latter, whose hands trembled in a manner to excite
pity, turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter. A last gleam
of feeling played over his features, and he fell, as if thunder-struck,
on a chair.

“Come, come,” said Aramis, after a long silence, during which the
governor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses, “do not lead
me to believe, dear Baisemeaux, that the presence of the general of the
order is as terrible as His, and that men die merely from having seen
Him. Take courage, rouse yourself; give me your hand--obey.”

Baisemeaux, reassured, if not satisfied, obeyed, kissed Aramis’s hand,
and rose. “Immediately?” he murmured.

“Oh, there is no pressing haste, my host; take your place again, and do
the honors over this beautiful dessert.”

“Monseigneur, I shall never recover such a shock as this; I who have
laughed, who have jested with you! I who have dared to treat you on a
footing of equality!”

“Say nothing about it, old comrade,” replied the bishop, who perceived
how strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break
it; “say nothing about it. Let us each live in our own way; to you,
my protection and my friendship; to me, your obedience. Having exactly
fulfilled these two requirements, let us live happily.”

Baisemeaux reflected; he perceived, at a glance, the consequence of this
withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order; and, putting in the
scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general,
did not consider it of any value.

Aramis divined this. “My dear Baisemeaux,” said he, “you are a
simpleton. Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble
to think for you.”

And at another gesture he made, Baisemeaux bowed again. “How shall I set
about it?” he said.

“What is the process for releasing a prisoner?”

“I have the regulations.”

“Well, then, follow the regulations, my friend.”

“I go with my major to the prisoner’s room, and conduct him, if he is a
personage of importance.”

“But this Marchiali is not an important personage,” said Aramis
carelessly.

“I don’t know,” answered the governor, as if he would have said, “It is
for you to instruct me.”

“Then if you don’t know it, I am right; so act towards Marchiali as you
act towards one of obscure station.”

“Good; the regulations so provide. They are to the effect that the
turnkey, or one of the lower officials, shall bring the prisoner before
the governor, in the office.”

“Well, ‘tis very wise, that; and then?”

“Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his
imprisonment, his clothes and papers, if the minister’s orders have not
otherwise dictated.”

“What was the minister’s order as to this Marchiali?”

“Nothing; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels, without
papers, and almost without clothes.”

“See how simple, then, all is. Indeed, Baisemeaux, you make a mountain
of everything. Remain here, and make them bring the prisoner to the
governor’s house.”

Baisemeaux obeyed. He summoned his lieutenant, and gave him an order,
which the latter passed on, without disturbing himself about it, to the
next whom it concerned.

Half an hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court; it was the
door to the dungeon, which had just rendered up its prey to the free
air. Aramis blew out all the candles which lighted the room but one,
which he left burning behind the door. This flickering glare prevented
the sight from resting steadily on any object. It multiplied tenfold the
changing forms and shadows of the place, by its wavering uncertainty.
Steps drew near.

“Go and meet your men,” said Aramis to Baisemeaux.

The governor obeyed. The sergeant and turnkeys disappeared. Baisemeaux
re-entered, followed by a prisoner. Aramis had placed himself in the
shade; he saw without being seen. Baisemeaux, in an agitated tone of
voice, made the young man acquainted with the order which set him at
liberty. The prisoner listened, without making a single gesture or
saying a word.

“You will swear [‘tis the regulation that requires it),” added the
governor, “never to reveal anything that you have seen or heard in the
Bastile.”

The prisoner perceived a crucifix; he stretched out his hands and swore
with his lips. “And now, monsieur, you are free. Whither do you intend
going?”

The prisoner turned his head, as if looking behind him for some
protection, on which he ought to rely. Then was it that Aramis came out
of the shade: “I am here,” he said, “to render the gentleman whatever
service he may please to ask.”

The prisoner slightly reddened, and, without hesitation, passed his arm
through that of Aramis. “God have you in his holy keeping,” he said, in
a voice the firmness of which made the governor tremble as much as the
form of the blessing astonished him.

Aramis, on shaking hands with Baisemeaux, said to him; “Does my order
trouble you? Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to
search?”

“I desire to keep it, monseigneur,” said Baisemeaux. “If they found it
here, it would be a certain indication I should be lost, and in that
case you would be a powerful and a last auxiliary for me.”

“Being your accomplice, you mean?” answered Aramis, shrugging his
shoulders. “Adieu, Baisemeaux,” said he.

The horses were in waiting, making each rusty spring reverberate the
carriage again with their impatience. Baisemeaux accompanied the bishop
to the bottom of the steps. Aramis caused his companion to mount before
him, then followed, and without giving the driver any further order, “Go
on,” said he. The carriage rattled over the pavement of the courtyard.
An officer with a torch went before the horses, and gave orders at
every post to let them pass. During the time taken in opening all the
barriers, Aramis barely breathed, and you might have heard his “sealed
heart knock against his ribs.” The prisoner, buried in a corner of the
carriage, made no more sign of life than his companion. At length, a
jolt more sever than the others announced to them that they had cleared
the last watercourse. Behind the carriage closed the last gate, that
in the Rue St. Antoine. No more walls either on the right or the left;
heaven everywhere, liberty everywhere, and life everywhere. The horses,
kept in check by a vigorous hand, went quietly as far as the middle of
the faubourg. There they began to trot. Little by little, whether they
were warming to their work, or whether they were urged, they gained in
swiftness, and once past Bercy, the carriage seemed to fly, so great was
the ardor of the coursers. The horses galloped thus as far as Villeneuve
St. George’s, where relays were waiting. Then four instead of two
whirled the carriage away in the direction of Melun, and pulled up for
a moment in the middle of the forest of Senart. No doubt the order had
been given the postilion beforehand, for Aramis had no occasion even to
make a sign.

“What is the matter?” asked the prisoner, as if waking from a long
dream.

“The matter is, monseigneur,” said Aramis, “that before going further,
it is necessary your royal highness and I should converse.”

“I will await an opportunity, monsieur,” answered the young prince.

“We could not have a better, monseigneur. We are in the middle of a
forest, and no one can hear us.”

“The postilion?”

“The postilion of this relay is deaf and dumb, monseigneur.”

“I am at your service, M. d’Herblay.”

“Is it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?”

“Yes; we are comfortably seated, and I like this carriage, for it has
restored me to liberty.”

“Wait, monseigneur; there is yet a precaution to be taken.”

“What?”

“We are here on the highway; cavaliers or carriages traveling
like ourselves might pass, and seeing us stopping, deem us in some
difficulty. Let us avoid offers of assistance, which would embarrass
us.”

“Give the postilion orders to conceal the carriage in one of the side
avenues.”

“‘Tis exactly what I wished to do, monseigneur.”

Aramis made a sign to the deaf and dumb driver of the carriage, whom
he touched on the arm. The latter dismounted, took the leaders by the
bridle, and led them over the velvet sward and the mossy grass of a
winding alley, at the bottom of which, on this moonless night, the deep
shades formed a curtain blacker than ink. This done, the man lay down
on a slope near his horses, who, on either side, kept nibbling the young
oak shoots.

“I am listening,” said the young prince to Aramis; “but what are you
doing there?”

“I am disarming myself of my pistols, of which we have no further need,
monseigneur.”



Chapter IX. The Tempter.

“My prince,” said Aramis, turning in the carriage towards his companion,
“weak creature as I am, so unpretending in genius, so low in the scale
of intelligent beings, it has never yet happened to me to converse with
a man without penetrating his thoughts through that living mask which
has been thrown over our mind, in order to retain its expression. But
to-night, in this darkness, in the reserve which you maintain, I can
read nothing on your features, and something tells me that I shall have
great difficulty in wresting from you a sincere declaration. I beseech
you, then, not for love of me, for subjects should never weigh as
anything in the balance which princes hold, but for love of yourself,
to retain every syllable, every inflexion which, under the present most
grave circumstances, will all have a sense and value as important as any
every uttered in the world.”

“I listen,” replied the young prince, “decidedly, without either eagerly
seeking or fearing anything you are about to say to me.” And he buried
himself still deeper in the thick cushions of the carriage, trying to
deprive his companion not only of the sight of him, but even of the very
idea of his presence.

Black was the darkness which fell wide and dense from the summits of the
intertwining trees. The carriage, covered in by this prodigious roof,
would not have received a particle of light, not even if a ray could
have struggled through the wreaths of mist that were already rising in
the avenue.

“Monseigneur,” resumed Aramis, “you know the history of the government
which to-day controls France. The king issued from an infancy imprisoned
like yours, obscure as yours, and confined as yours; only, instead
of ending, like yourself, this slavery in a prison, this obscurity in
solitude, these straightened circumstances in concealment, he was
fain to bear all these miseries, humiliations, and distresses, in full
daylight, under the pitiless sun of royalty; on an elevation flooded
with light, where every stain appears a blemish, every glory a stain.
The king has suffered; it rankles in his mind; and he will avenge
himself. He will be a bad king. I say not that he will pour out his
people’s blood, like Louis XI., or Charles IX.; for he has no mortal
injuries to avenge; but he will devour the means and substance of his
people; for he has himself undergone wrongs in his own interest and
money. In the first place, then, I acquit my conscience, when I consider
openly the merits and the faults of this great prince; and if I condemn
him, my conscience absolves me.”

Aramis paused. It was not to listen if the silence of the forest
remained undisturbed, but it was to gather up his thoughts from the very
bottom of his soul--to leave the thoughts he had uttered sufficient time
to eat deeply into the mind of his companion.

“All that Heaven does, Heaven does well,” continued the bishop of
Vannes; “and I am so persuaded of it that I have long been thankful
to have been chosen depositary of the secret which I have aided you
to discover. To a just Providence was necessary an instrument, at once
penetrating, persevering, and convinced, to accomplish a great work. I
am this instrument. I possess penetration, perseverance, conviction; I
govern a mysterious people, who has taken for its motto, the motto
of God, ‘_Patiens quia oeternus_.’” The prince moved. “I divine,
monseigneur, why you are raising your head, and are surprised at the
people I have under my command. You did not know you were dealing with a
king--oh! monseigneur, king of a people very humble, much disinherited;
humble because they have no force save when creeping; disinherited,
because never, almost never in this world, do my people reap the harvest
they sow, nor eat the fruit they cultivate. They labor for an abstract
idea; they heap together all the atoms of their power, so from a single
man; and round this man, with the sweat of their labor, they create a
misty halo, which his genius shall, in turn, render a glory gilded with
the rays of all the crowns in Christendom. Such is the man you have
beside you, monseigneur. It is to tell you that he has drawn you from
the abyss for a great purpose, to raise you above the powers of the
earth--above himself.” [1]

The prince lightly touched Aramis’s arm. “You speak to me,” he said,
“of that religious order whose chief you are. For me, the result of your
words is, that the day you desire to hurl down the man you shall have
raised, the event will be accomplished; and that you will keep under
your hand your creation of yesterday.”

“Undeceive yourself, monseigneur,” replied the bishop. “I should not
take the trouble to play this terrible game with your royal highness, if
I had not a double interest in gaining it. The day you are elevated, you
are elevated forever; you will overturn the footstool, as you rise, and
will send it rolling so far, that not even the sight of it will ever
again recall to you its right to simple gratitude.”

“Oh, monsieur!”

“Your movement, monseigneur, arises from an excellent disposition.
I thank you. Be well assured, I aspire to more than gratitude! I am
convinced that, when arrived at the summit, you will judge me still more
worthy to be your friend; and then, monseigneur, we two will do such
great deeds, that ages hereafter shall long speak of them.”

“Tell me plainly, monsieur--tell me without disguise--what I am to-day,
and what you aim at my being to-morrow.”

“You are the son of King Louis XIII., brother of Louis XIV., natural
and legitimate heir to the throne of France. In keeping you near him,
as Monsieur has been kept--Monsieur, your younger brother--the king
reserved to himself the right of being legitimate sovereign. The doctors
only could dispute his legitimacy. But the doctors always prefer the
king who is to the king who is not. Providence has willed that you
should be persecuted; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of
France. You had, then, a right to reign, seeing that it is disputed; you
had a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed; and
you possess royal blood, since no one has dared to shed yours, as that
of your servants has been shed. Now see, then, what this Providence,
which you have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you, has
done for you. It has given you the features, figure, age, and voice
of your brother; and the very causes of your persecution are about
to become those of your triumphant restoration. To-morrow, after
to-morrow--from the very first, regal phantom, living shade of Louis
XIV., you will sit upon his throne, whence the will of Heaven, confided
in execution to the arm of man, will have hurled him, without hope of
return.”

“I understand,” said the prince, “my brother’s blood will not be shed,
then.”

“You will be sole arbiter of his fate.”

“The secret of which they made an evil use against me?”

“You will employ it against him. What did he do to conceal it? He
concealed you. Living image of himself, you will defeat the conspiracy
of Mazarin and Anne of Austria. You, my prince, will have the same
interest in concealing him, who will, as a prisoner, resemble you, as
you will resemble him as a king.”

“I fall back on what I was saying to you. Who will guard him?”

“Who guarded _you?_”

“You know this secret--you have made use of it with regard to myself.
Who else knows it?”

“The queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse.”

“What will they do?”

“Nothing, if you choose.”

“How is that?”

“How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can
recognize you?”

“‘Tis true; but there are grave difficulties.”

“State them, prince.”

“My brother is married; I cannot take my brother’s wife.”

“I will cause Spain to consent to a divorce; it is in the interest of
your new policy; it is human morality. All that is really noble and
really useful in this world will find its account therein.”

“The imprisoned king will speak.”

“To whom do you think he will speak--to the walls?”

“You mean, by walls, the men in whom you put confidence.”

“If need be, yes. And besides, your royal highness--”

“Besides?”

“I was going to say, that the designs of Providence do not stop on such
a fair road. Every scheme of this caliber is completed by its results,
like a geometrical calculation. The king, in prison, will not be for you
the cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned.
His soul is naturally proud and impatient; it is, moreover, disarmed and
enfeebled, by being accustomed to honors, and by the license of supreme
power. The same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in
the geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to
your royal highness should be your ascension to the throne, and the
destruction of him who is hurtful to you, has also determined that
the conquered one shall soon end both his own and your sufferings.
Therefore, his soul and body have been adapted for but a brief agony.
Put into prison as a private individual, left alone with your doubts,
deprived of everything, you have exhibited the most sublime, enduring
principle of life in withstanding all this. But your brother, a captive,
forgotten, and in bonds, will not long endure the calamity; and Heaven
will resume his soul at the appointed time--that is to say, soon.”

At this point in Aramis’s gloomy analysis, a bird of night uttered from
the depths of the forest that prolonged and plaintive cry which makes
every creature tremble.

“I will exile the deposed king,” said Philippe, shuddering; “‘twill be
more human.”

“The king’s good pleasure will decide the point,” said Aramis. “But has
the problem been well put? Have I brought out of the solution according
to the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness?”

“Yes, monsieur, yes; you have forgotten nothing--except, indeed, two
things.”

“The first?”

“Let us speak of it at once, with the same frankness we have already
conversed in. Let us speak of the causes which may bring about the ruin
of all the hopes we have conceived. Let us speak of the risks we are
running.”

“They would be immense, infinite, terrific, insurmountable, if, as I
have said, all things did not concur to render them of absolutely no
account. There is no danger either for you or for me, if the constancy
and intrepidity of your royal highness are equal to that perfection of
resemblance to your brother which nature has bestowed upon you. I repeat
it, there are no dangers, only obstacles; a word, indeed, which I find
in all languages, but have always ill-understood, and, were I king,
would have obliterated as useless and absurd.”

“Yes, indeed, monsieur; there is a very serious obstacle, an
insurmountable danger, which you are forgetting.”

“Ah!” said Aramis.

“There is conscience, which cries aloud; remorse, that never dies.”

“True, true,” said the bishop; “there is a weakness of heart of which
you remind me. You are right, too, for that, indeed, is an immense
obstacle. The horse afraid of the ditch, leaps into the middle of it,
and is killed! The man who trembling crosses his sword with that of
another leaves loopholes whereby his enemy has him in his power.”

“Have you a brother?” said the young man to Aramis.

“I am alone in the world,” said the latter, with a hard, dry voice.

“But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?” added
Philippe.

“No one!--Yes, I love you.”

The young man sank into so profound a silence, that the mere sound of
his respiration seemed like a roaring tumult for Aramis. “Monseigneur,”
 he resumed, “I have not said all I had to say to your royal highness;
I have not offered you all the salutary counsels and useful resources
which I have at my disposal. It is useless to flash bright visions
before the eyes of one who seeks and loves darkness: useless, too, is
it to let the magnificence of the cannon’s roar make itself heard in the
ears of one who loves repose and the quiet of the country. Monseigneur,
I have your happiness spread out before me in my thoughts; listen to my
words; precious they indeed are, in their import and their sense,
for you who look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens, the
verdant meadows, the pure air. I know a country instinct with
delights of every kind, an unknown paradise, a secluded corner of the
world--where alone, unfettered and unknown, in the thick covert of the
woods, amidst flowers, and streams of rippling water, you will forget
all the misery that human folly has so recently allotted you. Oh! listen
to me, my prince. I do not jest. I have a heart, and mind, and soul, and
can read your own,--aye, even to its depths. I will not take you unready
for your task, in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires,
of my caprice, or my ambition. Let it be all or nothing. You are chilled
and galled, sick at heart, overcome by excess of the emotions which but
one hour’s liberty has produced in you. For me, that is a certain and
unmistakable sign that you do not wish to continue at liberty. Would you
prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength? Heaven
is my witness, that I wish your happiness to be the result of the trial
to which I have exposed you.”

“Speak, speak,” said the prince, with a vivacity which did not escape
Aramis.

“I know,” resumed the prelate, “in the Bas-Poitou, a canton, of which
no one in France suspects the existence. Twenty leagues of country is
immense, is it not? Twenty leagues, monseigneur, all covered with water
and herbage, and reeds of the most luxuriant nature; the whole studded
with islands covered with woods of the densest foliage. These large
marshes, covered with reeds as with a thick mantle, sleep silently and
calmly beneath the sun’s soft and genial rays. A few fishermen with
their families indolently pass their lives away there, with their great
living-rafts of poplar and alder, the flooring formed of reeds, and the
roof woven out of thick rushes. These barks, these floating-houses, are
wafted to and fro by the changing winds. Whenever they touch a bank, it
is but by chance; and so gently, too, that the sleeping fisherman is not
awakened by the shock. Should he wish to land, it is merely because he
has seen a large flight of landrails or plovers, of wild ducks, teal,
widgeon, or woodchucks, which fall an easy pray to net or gun. Silver
shad, eels, greedy pike, red and gray mullet, swim in shoals into his
nets; he has but to choose the finest and largest, and return the others
to the waters. Never yet has the food of the stranger, be he soldier
or simple citizen, never has any one, indeed, penetrated into that
district. The sun’s rays there are soft and tempered: in plots of solid
earth, whose soil is swart and fertile, grows the vine, nourishing with
generous juice its purple, white, and golden grapes. Once a week, a boat
is sent to deliver the bread which has been baked at an oven--the common
property of all. There--like the seigneurs of early days--powerful in
virtue of your dogs, your fishing-lines, your guns, and your beautiful
reed-built house, would you live, rich in the produce of the chase,
in plentitude of absolute secrecy. There would years of your life roll
away, at the end of which, no longer recognizable, for you would have
been perfectly transformed, you would have succeeded in acquiring a
destiny accorded to you by Heaven. There are a thousand pistoles in this
bag, monseigneur--more, far more, than sufficient to purchase the whole
marsh of which I have spoken; more than enough to live there as many
years as you have days to live; more than enough to constitute you the
richest, the freest, and the happiest man in the country. Accept it,
as I offer it you--sincerely, cheerfully. Forthwith, without a moment’s
pause, I will unharness two of my horses, which are attached to the
carriage yonder, and they, accompanied by my servant--my deaf and dumb
attendant--shall conduct you--traveling throughout the night, sleeping
during the day--to the locality I have described; and I shall, at least,
have the satisfaction of knowing that I have rendered to my prince the
major service he himself preferred. I shall have made one human being
happy; and Heaven for that will hold me in better account than if I had
made one man powerful; the former task is far more difficult. And now,
monseigneur, your answer to this proposition? Here is the money. Nay,
do not hesitate. At Poitou, you can risk nothing, except the chance of
catching the fevers prevalent there; and even of them, the so-called
wizards of the country will cure you, for the sake of your pistoles. If
you play the other game, you run the chance of being assassinated on a
throne, strangled in a prison-cell. Upon my soul, I assure you, now I
begin to compare them together, I myself should hesitate which lot I
should accept.”

“Monsieur,” replied the young prince, “before I determine, let me alight
from this carriage, walk on the ground, and consult that still voice
within me, which Heaven bids us all to hearken to. Ten minutes is all I
ask, and then you shall have your answer.”

“As you please, monseigneur,” said Aramis, bending before him with
respect, so solemn and august in tone and address had sounded these
strange words.



Chapter X. Crown and Tiara.

Aramis was the first to descend from the carriage; he held the door open
for the young man. He saw him place his foot on the mossy ground with
a trembling of the whole body, and walk round the carriage with an
unsteady and almost tottering step. It seemed as if the poor prisoner
was unaccustomed to walk on God’s earth. It was the 15th of August,
about eleven o’clock at night; thick clouds, portending a tempest,
overspread the heavens, and shrouded every light and prospect underneath
their heavy folds. The extremities of the avenues were imperceptibly
detached from the copse, by a lighter shadow of opaque gray, which, upon
closer examination, became visible in the midst of the obscurity.
But the fragrance which ascended from the grass, fresher and more
penetrating than that which exhaled from the trees around him; the warm
and balmy air which enveloped him for the first time for many years
past; the ineffable enjoyment of liberty in an open country, spoke
to the prince in so seductive a language, that notwithstanding the
preternatural caution, we would almost say dissimulation of his
character, of which we have tried to give an idea, he could not restrain
his emotion, and breathed a sigh of ecstasy. Then, by degrees, he raised
his aching head and inhaled the softly scented air, as it was wafted in
gentle gusts to his uplifted face. Crossing his arms on his chest, as if
to control this new sensation of delight, he drank in delicious draughts
of that mysterious air which interpenetrates at night the loftiest
forests. The sky he was contemplating, the murmuring waters, the
universal freshness--was not all this reality? Was not Aramis a madman
to suppose that he had aught else to dream of in this world? Those
exciting pictures of country life, so free from fears and troubles,
the ocean of happy days that glitters incessantly before all young
imaginations, are real allurements wherewith to fascinate a poor,
unhappy prisoner, worn out by prison cares, emaciated by the stifling
air of the Bastile. It was the picture, it will be remembered, drawn
by Aramis, when he offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in
the carriage to the prince, and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of
Bas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the world. Such were the reflections of
Aramis as he watched, with an anxiety impossible to describe, the
silent progress of the emotions of Philippe, whom he perceived gradually
becoming more and more absorbed in his meditations. The young prince was
offering up an inward prayer to Heaven, to be divinely guided in this
trying moment, upon which his life or death depended. It was an anxious
time for the bishop of Vannes, who had never before been so perplexed.
His iron will, accustomed to overcome all obstacles, never finding
itself inferior or vanquished on any occasion, to be foiled in so vast a
project from not having foreseen the influence which a view of nature in
all its luxuriance would have on the human mind! Aramis, overwhelmed by
anxiety, contemplated with emotion the painful struggle that was taking
place in Philippe’s mind. This suspense lasted the whole ten minutes
which the young man had requested. During this space of time, which
appeared an eternity, Philippe continued gazing with an imploring and
sorrowful look towards the heavens; Aramis did not remove the piercing
glance he had fixed on Philippe. Suddenly the young man bowed his head.
His thought returned to the earth, his looks perceptibly hardened, his
brow contracted, his mouth assuming an expression of undaunted courage;
again his looks became fixed, but this time they wore a worldly
expression, hardened by covetousness, pride, and strong desire. Aramis’s
look immediately became as soft as it had before been gloomy. Philippe,
seizing his hand in a quick, agitated manner, exclaimed:

“Lead me to where the crown of France is to be found.”

“Is this your decision, monseigneur?” asked Aramis.

“It is.”

“Irrevocably so?”

Philippe did not even deign to reply. He gazed earnestly at the bishop,
as if to ask him if it were possible for a man to waver after having
once made up his mind.

“Such looks are flashes of the hidden fire that betrays men’s
character,” said Aramis, bowing over Philippe’s hand; “you will be
great, monseigneur, I will answer for that.”

“Let us resume our conversation. I wished to discuss two points with
you; in the first place the dangers, or the obstacles we may meet with.
That point is decided. The other is the conditions you intend imposing
on me. It is your turn to speak, M. d’Herblay.”

“The conditions, monseigneur?”

“Doubtless. You will not allow so mere a trifle to stop me, and you will
not do me the injustice to suppose that I think you have no interest in
this affair. Therefore, without subterfuge or hesitation, tell me the
truth--”

“I will do so, monseigneur. Once a king--”

“When will that be?”

“To-morrow evening--I mean in the night.”

“Explain yourself.”

“When I shall have asked your highness a question.”

“Do so.”

“I sent to your highness a man in my confidence with instructions to
deliver some closely written notes, carefully drawn up, which will
thoroughly acquaint your highness with the different persons who compose
and will compose your court.”

“I perused those notes.”

“Attentively?”

“I know them by heart.”

“And understand them? Pardon me, but I may venture to ask that question
of a poor, abandoned captive of the Bastile? In a week’s time it will
not be requisite to further question a mind like yours. You will then be
in full possession of liberty and power.”

“Interrogate me, then, and I will be a scholar representing his lesson
to his master.”

“We will begin with your family, monseigneur.”

“My mother, Anne of Austria! all her sorrows, her painful malady. Oh! I
know her--I know her.”

“Your second brother?” asked Aramis, bowing.

“To these notes,” replied the prince, “you have added portraits so
faithfully painted, that I am able to recognize the persons whose
characters, manners, and history you have so carefully portrayed.
Monsieur, my brother, is a fine, dark young man, with a pale face; he
does not love his wife, Henrietta, whom I, Louis XIV., loved a little,
and still flirt with, even although she made me weep on the day she
wished to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from her service in
disgrace.”

“You will have to be careful with regard to the watchfulness of the
latter,” said Aramis; “she is sincerely attached to the actual king. The
eyes of a woman who loves are not easily deceived.”

“She is fair, has blue eyes, whose affectionate gaze reveals her
identity. She halts slightly in her gait; she writes a letter every day,
to which I have to send an answer by M. de Saint-Aignan.”

“Do you know the latter?”

“As if I saw him, and I know the last verses he composed for me, as well
as those I composed in answer to his.”

“Very good. Do you know your ministers?”

“Colbert, an ugly, dark-browed man, but intelligent enough, his hair
covering his forehead, a large, heavy, full head; the mortal enemy of M.
Fouquet.”

“As for the latter, we need not disturb ourselves about him.”

“No; because necessarily you will not require me to exile him, I
suppose?”

Aramis, struck with admiration at the remark, said, “You will become
very great, monseigneur.”

“You see,” added the prince, “that I know my lesson by heart, and with
Heaven’s assistance, and yours afterwards, I shall seldom go wrong.”

“You have still an awkward pair of eyes to deal with, monseigneur.”

“Yes, the captain of the musketeers, M. d’Artagnan, your friend.”

“Yes; I can well say ‘my friend.’”

“He who escorted La Valliere to Le Chaillot; he who delivered up Monk,
cooped in an iron box, to Charles II.; he who so faithfully served
my mother; he to whom the crown of France owes so much that it owes
everything. Do you intend to ask me to exile him also?”

“Never, sire. D’Artagnan is a man to whom, at a certain given time, I
will undertake to reveal everything; but be on your guard with him, for
if he discovers our plot before it is revealed to him, you or I will
certainly be killed or taken. He is a bold and enterprising man.”

“I will think it over. Now tell me about M. Fouquet; what do you wish to
be done with regard to him?”

“One moment more, I entreat you, monseigneur; and forgive me, if I seem
to fail in respect to questioning you further.”

“It is your duty to do so, nay, more than that, your right.”

“Before we pass to M. Fouquet, I should very much regret forgetting
another friend of mine.”

“M. du Vallon, the Hercules of France, you mean; oh! as far as he is
concerned, his interests are more than safe.”

“No; it is not he whom I intended to refer to.”

“The Comte de la Fere, then?”

“And his son, the son of all four of us.”

“That poor boy who is dying of love for La Valliere, whom my brother
so disloyally bereft him of? Be easy on that score. I shall know how to
rehabilitate his happiness. Tell me only one thing, Monsieur d’Herblay;
do men, when they love, forget the treachery that has been shown them?
Can a man ever forgive the woman who has betrayed him? Is that a French
custom, or is it one of the laws of the human heart?”

“A man who loves deeply, as deeply as Raoul loves Mademoiselle de la
Valliere, finishes by forgetting the fault or crime of the woman he
loves; but I do not yet know whether Raoul will be able to forget.”

“I will see after that. Have you anything further to say about your
friend?”

“No; that is all.”

“Well, then, now for M. Fouquet. What do you wish me to do for him?”

“To keep him on as surintendant, in the capacity in which he has
hitherto acted, I entreat you.”

“Be it so; but he is the first minister at present.”

“Not quite so.”

“A king, ignorant and embarrassed as I shall be, will, as a matter of
course, require a first minister of state.”

“Your majesty will require a friend.”

“I have only one, and that is yourself.”

“You will have many others by and by, but none so devoted, none so
zealous for your glory.”

“You shall be my first minister of state.”

“Not immediately, monseigneur, for that would give rise to too much
suspicion and astonishment.”

“M. de Richelieu, the first minister of my grandmother, Marie de Medici,
was simply bishop of Lucon, as you are bishop of Vannes.”

“I perceive that your royal highness has studied my notes to great
advantage; your amazing perspicacity overpowers me with delight.”

“I am perfectly aware that M. de Richelieu, by means of the queen’s
protection, soon became cardinal.”

“It would be better,” said Aramis, bowing, “that I should not be
appointed first minister until your royal highness has procured my
nomination as cardinal.”

“You shall be nominated before two months are past, Monsieur d’Herblay.
But that is a matter of very trifling moment; you would not offend me if
you were to ask more than that, and you would cause me serious regret if
you were to limit yourself to that.”

“In that case, I have something still further to hope for, monseigneur.”

“Speak! speak!”

“M. Fouquet will not keep long at the head of affairs, he will soon get
old. He is fond of pleasure, consistently, I mean, with all his labors,
thanks to the youthfulness he still retains; but this protracted youth
will disappear at the approach of the first serious annoyance, or at
the first illness he may experience. We will spare him the annoyance,
because he is an agreeable and noble-hearted man; but we cannot save him
from ill-health. So it is determined. When you shall have paid all M.
Fouquet’s debts, and restored the finances to a sound condition, M.
Fouquet will be able to remain the sovereign ruler in his little court
of poets and painters,--we shall have made him rich. When that has been
done, and I have become your royal highness’s prime minister, I shall be
able to think of my own interests and yours.”

The young man looked at his interrogator.

“M. de Richelieu, of whom we were speaking just now, was very much to
blame in the fixed idea he had of governing France alone, unaided. He
allowed two kings, King Louis XIII. and himself, to be seated on the
self-same throne, whilst he might have installed them more conveniently
upon two separate and distinct thrones.”

“Upon two thrones?” said the young man, thoughtfully.

“In fact,” pursued Aramis, quietly, “a cardinal, prime minister of
France, assisted by the favor and by the countenance of his Most
Christian Majesty the King of France, a cardinal to whom the king his
master lends the treasures of the state, his army, his counsel, such
a man would be acting with twofold injustice in applying these mighty
resources to France alone. Besides,” added Aramis, “you will not be a
king such as your father was, delicate in health, slow in judgment, whom
all things wearied; you will be a king governing by your brain and by
your sword; you will have in the government of the state no more than
you will be able to manage unaided; I should only interfere with you.
Besides, our friendship ought never to be, I do not say impaired, but
in any degree affected, by a secret thought. I shall have given you
the throne of France, you will confer on me the throne of St. Peter.
Whenever your loyal, firm, and mailed hand should joined in ties of
intimate association the hand of a pope such as I shall be, neither
Charles V., who owned two-thirds of the habitable globe, nor
Charlemagne, who possessed it entirely, will be able to reach to half
your stature. I have no alliances, I have no predilections; I will not
throw you into persecutions of heretics, nor will I cast you into the
troubled waters of family dissension; I will simply say to you: The
whole universe is our own; for me the minds of men, for you their
bodies. And as I shall be the first to die, you will have my
inheritance. What do you say of my plan, monseigneur?”

“I say that you render me happy and proud, for no other reason than that
of having comprehended you thoroughly. Monsieur d’Herblay, you shall be
cardinal, and when cardinal, my prime minister; and then you will point
out to me the necessary steps to be taken to secure your election as
pope, and I will take them. You can ask what guarantees from me you
please.”

“It is useless. Never shall I act except in such a manner that you will
be the gainer; I shall never ascend the ladder of fortune, fame, or
position, until I have first seen you placed upon the round of the
ladder immediately above me; I shall always hold myself sufficiently
aloof from you to escape incurring your jealousy, sufficiently near to
sustain your personal advantage and to watch over your friendship. All
the contracts in the world are easily violated because the interests
included in them incline more to one side than to another. With us,
however, this will never be the case; I have no need of any guarantees.”

“And so--my dear brother--will disappear?”

“Simply. We will remove him from his bed by means of a plank which
yields to the pressure of the finger. Having retired to rest a crowned
sovereign, he will awake a captive. Alone you will rule from that
moment, and you will have no interest dearer and better than that of
keeping me near you.”

“I believe it. There is my hand on it, Monsieur d’Herblay.”

“Allow me to kneel before you, sire, most respectfully. We will embrace
each other on the day we shall have upon our temples, you the crown, I
the tiara.”

“Still embrace me this very day also, and be, for and towards me, more
than great, more than skillful, more than sublime in genius; be kind and
indulgent--be my father!”

Aramis was almost overcome as he listened to his voice; he fancied
he detected in his own heart an emotion hitherto unknown; but this
impression was speedily removed. “His father!” he thought; “yes, his
Holy Father.”

And they resumed their places in the carriage, which sped rapidly along
the road leading to Vaux-le-Vicomte.



Chapter XI. The Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte.

The chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte, situated about a league from Melun, had
been built by Fouquet in 1655, at a time when there was a scarcity
of money in France; Mazarin had taken all that there was, and Fouquet
expended the remainder. However, as certain men have fertile, false, and
useful vices, Fouquet, in scattering broadcast millions of money in
the construction of this palace, had found a means of gathering, as the
result of his generous profusion, three illustrious men together: Levau,
the architect of the building; Lenotre, the designer of the gardens;
and Lebrun, the decorator of the apartments. If the Chateau de Vaux
possessed a single fault with which it could be reproached, it was its
grand, pretentious character. It is even at the present day proverbial
to calculate the number of acres of roofing, the restoration of which
would, in our age, be the ruin of fortunes cramped and narrowed as the
epoch itself. Vaux-le-Vicomte, when its magnificent gates, supported
by caryatides, have been passed through, has the principal front of the
main building opening upon a vast, so-called, court of honor, inclosed
by deep ditches, bordered by a magnificent stone balustrade. Nothing
could be more noble in appearance than the central forecourt raised upon
the flight of steps, like a king upon his throne, having around it
four pavilions at the angles, the immense Ionic columns of which rose
majestically to the whole height of the building. The friezes ornamented
with arabesques, and the pediments which crowned the pilasters,
conferred richness and grace on every part of the building, while the
domes which surmounted the whole added proportion and majesty. This
mansion, built by a subject, bore a far greater resemblance to those
royal residences which Wolsey fancied he was called upon to construct,
in order to present them to his master from the fear of rendering him
jealous. But if magnificence and splendor were displayed in any one
particular part of this palace more than another,--if anything could
be preferred to the wonderful arrangement of the interior, to the
sumptuousness of the gilding, and to the profusion of the paintings and
statues, it would be the park and gardens of Vaux. The _jets d’eau_,
which were regarded as wonderful in 1653, are still so, even at the
present time; the cascades awakened the admiration of kings and princes;
and as for the famous grotto, the theme of so many poetical effusions,
the residence of that illustrious nymph of Vaux, whom Pelisson made
converse with La Fontaine, we must be spared the description of all
its beauties. We will do as Despreaux did,--we will enter the park, the
trees of which are of eight years’ growth only--that is to say, in their
present position--and whose summits even yet, as they proudly tower
aloft, blushingly unfold their leaves to the earliest rays of the rising
sun. Lenotre had hastened the pleasure of the Maecenas of his period;
all the nursery-grounds had furnished trees whose growth had been
accelerated by careful culture and the richest plant-food. Every tree in
the neighborhood which presented a fair appearance of beauty or stature
had been taken up by its roots and transplanted to the park. Fouquet
could well afford to purchase trees to ornament his park, since he had
bought up three villages and their appurtenances (to use a legal word)
to increase its extent. M. de Scudery said of this palace, that, for the
purpose of keeping the grounds and gardens well watered, M. Fouquet had
divided a river into a thousand fountains, and gathered the waters of a
thousand fountains into torrents. This same Monsieur de Scudery said a
great many other things in his “Clelie,” about this palace of Valterre,
the charms of which he describes most minutely. We should be far wiser
to send our curious readers to Vaux to judge for themselves, than to
refer them to “Clelie;” and yet there are as many leagues from Paris to
Vaux, as there are volumes of the “Clelie.”

This magnificent palace had been got ready for the reception of the
greatest reigning sovereign of the time. M. Fouquet’s friends had
transported thither, some their actors and their dresses, others their
troops of sculptors and artists; not forgetting others with their
ready-mended pens,--floods of impromptus were contemplated. The
cascades, somewhat rebellious nymphs though they were, poured forth
their waters brighter and clearer than crystal: they scattered over the
bronze triton and nereids their waves of foam, which glistened like fire
in the rays of the sun. An army of servants were hurrying to and fro in
squadrons in the courtyard and corridors; while Fouquet, who had
only that morning arrived, walked all through the palace with a calm,
observant glance, in order to give his last orders, after his intendants
had inspected everything.

It was, as we have said, the 15th of August. The sun poured down its
burning rays upon the heathen deities of marble and bronze: it raised
the temperature of the water in the conch shells, and ripened, on the
walls, those magnificent peaches, of which the king, fifty years later,
spoke so regretfully, when, at Marly, on an occasion of a scarcity of
the finer sorts of peaches being complained of, in the beautiful gardens
there--gardens which had cost France double the amount that had been
expended on Vaux--the _great king_ observed to some one: “You are far
too young to have eaten any of M. Fouquet’s peaches.”

Oh, fame! Oh, blazon of renown! Oh, glory of this earth! That very man
whose judgment was so sound and accurate where merit was concerned--he
who had swept into his coffers the inheritance of Nicholas Fouquet, who
had robbed him of Lenotre and Lebrun, and had sent him to rot for the
remainder of his life in one of the state prisons--merely remembered the
peaches of that vanquished, crushed, forgotten enemy! It was to little
purpose that Fouquet had squandered thirty millions of francs in the
fountains of his gardens, in the crucibles of his sculptors, in
the writing-desks of his literary friends, in the portfolios of his
painters; vainly had he fancied that thereby he might be remembered. A
peach--a blushing, rich-flavored fruit, nestling in the trellis work
on the garden-wall, hidden beneath its long, green leaves,--this little
vegetable production, that a dormouse would nibble up without a thought,
was sufficient to recall to the memory of this great monarch the
mournful shade of the last surintendant of France.

With a perfect reliance that Aramis had made arrangements fairly to
distribute the vast number of guests throughout the palace, and that he
had not omitted to attend to any of the internal regulations for their
comfort, Fouquet devoted his entire attention to the _ensemble_ alone.
In one direction Gourville showed him the preparations which had been
made for the fireworks; in another, Moliere led him over the theater; at
last, after he had visited the chapel, the _salons_, and the galleries,
and was again going downstairs, exhausted with fatigue, Fouquet saw
Aramis on the staircase. The prelate beckoned to him. The surintendant
joined his friend, and, with him, paused before a large picture scarcely
finished. Applying himself, heart and soul, to his work, the painter
Lebrun, covered with perspiration, stained with paint, pale from fatigue
and the inspiration of genius, was putting the last finishing touches
with his rapid brush. It was the portrait of the king, whom they were
expecting, dressed in the court suit which Percerin had condescended to
show beforehand to the bishop of Vannes. Fouquet placed himself before
this portrait, which seemed to live, as one might say, in the cool
freshness of its flesh, and in its warmth of color. He gazed upon it
long and fixedly, estimated the prodigious labor that had been bestowed
upon it, and, not being able to find any recompense sufficiently great
for this Herculean effort, he passed his arm round the painter’s neck
and embraced him. The surintendant, by this action, had utterly ruined
a suit of clothes worth a thousand pistoles, but he had satisfied, more
than satisfied, Lebrun. It was a happy moment for the artist; it was an
unhappy moment for M. Percerin, who was walking behind Fouquet, and was
engaged in admiring, in Lebrun’s painting, the suit that he had made for
his majesty, a perfect _objet d’art_, as he called it, which was not to
be matched except in the wardrobe of the surintendant. His distress and
his exclamations were interrupted by a signal which had been given
from the summit of the mansion. In the direction of Melun, in the
still empty, open plain, the sentinels of Vaux had just perceived
the advancing procession of the king and the queens. His majesty was
entering Melun with his long train of carriages and cavaliers.

“In an hour--” said Aramis to Fouquet.

“In an hour!” replied the latter, sighing.

“And the people who ask one another what is the good of these royal
_fetes!_” continued the bishop of Vannes, laughing, with his false
smile.

“Alas! I, too, who am not the people, ask myself the same thing.”

“I will answer you in four and twenty hours, monseigneur. Assume a
cheerful countenance, for it should be a day of true rejoicing.”

“Well, believe me or not, as you like, D’Herblay,” said the
surintendant, with a swelling heart, pointing at the _cortege_ of Louis,
visible in the horizon, “he certainly loves me but very little, and I do
not care much more for him; but I cannot tell you how it is, that since
he is approaching my house--”

“Well, what?”

“Well, since I know he is on his way here, as my guest, he is more
sacred than ever for me; he is my acknowledged sovereign, and as such is
very dear to me.”

“Dear? yes,” said Aramis, playing upon the word, as the Abbe Terray did,
at a later period, with Louis XV.

“Do not laugh, D’Herblay; I feel that, if he really seemed to wish it, I
could love that young man.”

“You should not say that to me,” returned Aramis, “but rather to M.
Colbert.”

“To M. Colbert!” exclaimed Fouquet. “Why so?”

“Because he would allow you a pension out of the king’s privy purse,
as soon as he becomes surintendant,” said Aramis, preparing to leave as
soon as he had dealt this last blow.

“Where are you going?” returned Fouquet, with a gloomy look.

“To my own apartment, in order to change my costume, monseigneur.”

“Whereabouts are you lodging, D’Herblay?”

“In the blue room on the second story.”

“The room immediately over the king’s room?”

“Precisely.”

“You will be subject to very great restraint there. What an idea to
condemn yourself to a room where you cannot stir or move about!”

“During the night, monseigneur, I sleep or read in my bed.”

“And your servants?”

“I have but one attendant with me. I find my reader quite sufficient.
Adieu, monseigneur; do not overfatigue yourself; keep yourself fresh for
the arrival of the king.”

“We shall see you by and by, I suppose, and shall see your friend Du
Vallon also?”

“He is lodging next to me, and is at this moment dressing.”

And Fouquet, bowing, with a smile, passed on like a commander-in-chief
who pays the different outposts a visit after the enemy has been
signaled in sight. [2]



Chapter XII. The Wine of Melun.

The king had, in point of fact, entered Melun with the intention of
merely passing through the city. The youthful monarch was most eagerly
anxious for amusements; only twice during the journey had he been
able to catch a glimpse of La Valliere, and, suspecting that his only
opportunity of speaking to her would be after nightfall, in the gardens,
and after the ceremonial of reception had been gone through, he had been
very desirous to arrive at Vaux as early as possible. But he reckoned
without his captain of the musketeers, and without M. Colbert. Like
Calypso, who could not be consoled at the departure of Ulysses, our
Gascon could not console himself for not having guessed why Aramis had
asked Percerin to show him the king’s new costumes. “There is not a
doubt,” he said to himself, “that my friend the bishop of Vannes
had some motive in that;” and then he began to rack his brains most
uselessly. D’Artagnan, so intimately acquainted with all the court
intrigues, who knew the position of Fouquet better than even Fouquet
himself did, had conceived the strangest fancies and suspicions at the
announcement of the _fete_, which would have ruined a wealthy man, and
which became impossible, utter madness even, for a man so poor as he
was. And then, the presence of Aramis, who had returned from Belle-Isle,
and been nominated by Monsieur Fouquet inspector-general of all the
arrangements; his perseverance in mixing himself up with all the
surintendant’s affairs; his visits to Baisemeaux; all this suspicious
singularity of conduct had excessively troubled and tormented D’Artagnan
during the last two weeks.

“With men of Aramis’s stamp,” he said, “one is never the stronger except
sword in hand. So long as Aramis continued a soldier, there was hope of
getting the better of him; but since he has covered his cuirass with
a stole, we are lost. But what can Aramis’s object possibly be?” And
D’Artagnan plunged again into deep thought. “What does it matter to
me, after all,” he continued, “if his only object is to overthrow M.
Colbert? And what else can he be after?” And D’Artagnan rubbed his
forehead--that fertile land, whence the plowshare of his nails had
turned up so many and such admirable ideas in his time. He, at first,
thought of talking the matter over with Colbert, but his friendship for
Aramis, the oath of earlier days, bound him too strictly. He revolted at
the bare idea of such a thing, and, besides, he hated the financier too
cordially. Then, again, he wished to unburden his mind to the king; but
yet the king would not be able to understand the suspicions which had
not even a shadow of reality at their base. He resolved to address
himself to Aramis, direct, the first time he met him. “I will get him,”
 said the musketeer, “between a couple of candles, suddenly, and when he
least expects it, I will place my hand upon his heart, and he will
tell me--What will he tell me? Yes, he will tell me something, for
_mordioux!_ there is something in it, I know.”

Somewhat calmer, D’Artagnan made every preparation for the journey, and
took the greatest care that the military household of the king, as
yet very inconsiderable in numbers, should be well officered and well
disciplined in its meager and limited proportions. The result was that,
through the captain’s arrangements, the king, on arriving at Melun, saw
himself at the head of both the musketeers and Swiss guards, as well as
a picket of the French guards. It might almost have been called a small
army. M. Colbert looked at the troops with great delight: he even wished
they had been a third more in number.

“But why?” said the king.

“In order to show greater honor to M. Fouquet,” replied Colbert.

“In order to ruin him the sooner,” thought D’Artagnan.

When this little army appeared before Melun, the chief magistrates came
out to meet the king, and to present him with the keys of the city, and
invited him to enter the Hotel de Ville, in order to partake of the wine
of honor. The king, who expected to pass through the city and to proceed
to Vaux without delay, became quite red in the face from vexation.

“Who was fool enough to occasion this delay?” muttered the king, between
his teeth, as the chief magistrate was in the middle of a long address.

“Not I, certainly,” replied D’Artagnan, “but I believe it was M.
Colbert.”

Colbert, having heard his name pronounced, said, “What was M. d’Artagnan
good enough to say?”

“I was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king’s
progress, so that he might taste the _vin de Brie_. Was I right?”

“Quite so, monsieur.”

“In that case, then, it was you whom the king called some name or
other.”

“What name?”

“I hardly know; but wait a moment--idiot, I think it was--no, no, it was
fool or dolt. Yes; his majesty said that the man who had thought of the
_vin de Melun_ was something of the sort.”

D’Artagnan, after this broadside, quietly caressed his mustache; M.
Colbert’s large head seemed to become larger and larger than ever.
D’Artagnan, seeing how ugly anger made him, did not stop half-way. The
orator still went on with his speech, while the king’s color was visibly
increasing.

“_Mordioux!_” said the musketeer, coolly, “the king is going to have an
attack of determination of blood to the head. Where the deuce did you
get hold of that idea, Monsieur Colbert? You have no luck.”

“Monsieur,” said the financier, drawing himself up, “my zeal for the
king’s service inspired me with the idea.”

“Bah!”

“Monsieur, Melun is a city, an excellent city, which pays well, and
which it would be imprudent to displease.”

“There, now! I, who do not pretend to be a financier, saw only one idea
in your idea.”

“What was that, monsieur?”

“That of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet, who is making himself
quite giddy on his donjons yonder, in waiting for us.”

This was a home-stroke, hard enough in all conscience. Colbert was
completely thrown out of the saddle by it, and retired, thoroughly
discomfited. Fortunately, the speech was now at an end; the king drank
the wine which was presented to him, and then every one resumed the
progress through the city. The king bit his lips in anger, for the
evening was closing in, and all hope of a walk with La Valliere was at
an end. In order that the whole of the king’s household should enter
Vaux, four hours at least were necessary, owing to the different
arrangements. The king, therefore, who was boiling with impatience,
hurried forward as much as possible, in order to reach it before
nightfall. But, at the moment he was setting off again, other and fresh
difficulties arose.

“Is not the king going to sleep at Melun?” said Colbert, in a low tone
of voice, to D’Artagnan.

M. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day, to address himself in
that manner to the chief of the musketeers; for the latter guessed that
the king’s intention was very far from that of remaining where he was.
D’Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and
strongly accompanied; and desired that his majesty would not enter
except with all the escort. On the other hand, he felt that these delays
would irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure. In what way could
he possibly reconcile these difficulties? D’Artagnan took up Colbert’s
remark, and determined to repeated it to the king.

“Sire,” he said, “M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not
intend to sleep at Melun.”

“Sleep at Melun! What for?” exclaimed Louis XIV. “Sleep at Melun! Who,
in Heaven’s name, can have thought of such a thing, when M. Fouquet is
expecting us this evening?”

“It was simply,” replied Colbert, quickly, “the fear of causing your
majesty the least delay; for, according to established etiquette, you
cannot enter any place, with the exception of your own royal residences,
until the soldiers’ quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster,
and the garrison properly distributed.”

D’Artagnan listened with the greatest attention, biting his mustache to
conceal his vexation; and the queens were not less interested. They were
fatigued, and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any
farther; more especially, in order to prevent the king walking about in
the evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the court, for, if
etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms, the
ladies of honor, as soon as they had performed the services required of
them, had no restrictions placed upon them, but were at liberty to walk
about as they pleased. It will easily be conjectured that all these
rival interests, gathering together in vapors, necessarily produced
clouds, and that the clouds were likely to be followed by a tempest. The
king had no mustache to gnaw, and therefore kept biting the handle of
his whip instead, with ill-concealed impatience. How could he get out of
it? D’Artagnan looked as agreeable as possible, and Colbert as sulky as
he could. Who was there he could get in a passion with?

“We will consult the queen,” said Louis XIV., bowing to the royal
ladies. And this kindness of consideration softened Maria Theresa’s
heart, who, being of a kind and generous disposition, when left to her
own free-will, replied:

“I shall be delighted to do whatever your majesty wishes.”

“How long will it take us to get to Vaux?” inquired Anne of Austria, in
slow and measured accents, placing her hand upon her bosom, where the
seat of her pain lay.

“An hour for your majesty’s carriages,” said D’Artagnan; “the roads are
tolerably good.”

The king looked at him. “And a quarter of an hour for the king,” he
hastened to add.

“We should arrive by daylight?” said Louis XIV.

“But the billeting of the king’s military escort,” objected Colbert,
softly, “will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed,
however quick he may be.”

“Double ass that you are!” thought D’Artagnan; “if I had any interest
or motive in demolishing your credit with the king, I could do it in ten
minutes. If I were in the king’s place,” he added aloud, “I should, in
going to M. Fouquet, leave my escort behind me; I should go to him as a
friend; I should enter accompanied only by my captain of the guards;
I should consider that I was acting more nobly, and should be invested
with a still more sacred character by doing so.”

Delight sparkled in the king’s eyes. “That is indeed a very sensible
suggestion. We will go to see a friend as friends; the gentlemen who are
with the carriages can go slowly: but we who are mounted will ride on.”
 And he rode off, accompanied by all those who were mounted. Colbert hid
his ugly head behind his horse’s neck.

“I shall be quits,” said D’Artagnan, as he galloped along, “by getting
a little talk with Aramis this evening. And then, M. Fouquet is a man of
honor. _Mordioux!_ I have said so, and it must be so.”

And this was the way how, towards seven o’clock in the evening, without
announcing his arrival by the din of trumpets, and without even his
advanced guard, without out-riders or musketeers, the king presented
himself before the gate of Vaux, where Fouquet, who had been informed
of his royal guest’s approach, had been waiting for the last half-hour,
with his head uncovered, surrounded by his household and his friends.



Chapter XIII. Nectar and Ambrosia.

M. Fouquet held the stirrup of the king, who, having dismounted, bowed
most graciously, and more graciously still held out his hand to him,
which Fouquet, in spite of a slight resistance on the king’s part,
carried respectfully to his lips. The king wished to wait in the first
courtyard for the arrival of the carriages, nor had he long to wait, for
the roads had been put into excellent order by the superintendent, and
a stone would hardly have been found of the size of an egg the whole way
from Melun to Vaux; so that the carriages, rolling along as though on a
carpet, brought the ladies to Vaux, without jolting or fatigue, by eight
o’clock. They were received by Madame Fouquet, and at the moment they
made their appearance, a light as bright as day burst forth from every
quarter, trees, vases, and marble statues. This species of enchantment
lasted until their majesties had retired into the palace. All these
wonders and magical effects which the chronicler has heaped up, or
rather embalmed, in his recital, at the risk of rivaling the brain-born
scenes of romancers; these splendors whereby night seemed vanquished and
nature corrected, together with every delight and luxury combined for
the satisfaction of all the senses, as well as the imagination, Fouquet
did in real truth offer to his sovereign in that enchanting retreat of
which no monarch could at that time boast of possessing an equal. We do
not intend to describe the grand banquet, at which the royal guests
were present, nor the concerts, nor the fairy-like and more than magic
transformations and metamorphoses; it will be enough for our purpose
to depict the countenance the king assumed, which, from being gay, soon
wore a very gloomy, constrained, and irritated expression. He remembered
his own residence, royal though it was, and the mean and indifferent
style of luxury that prevailed there, which comprised but little more
than what was merely useful for the royal wants, without being his own
personal property. The large vases of the Louvre, the older furniture
and plate of Henry II., of Francis I., and of Louis XI., were but
historic monuments of earlier days; nothing but specimens of art, the
relics of his predecessors; while with Fouquet, the value of the article
was as much in the workmanship as in the article itself. Fouquet ate
from a gold service, which artists in his own employ had modeled and
cast for him alone. Fouquet drank wines of which the king of France did
not even know the name, and drank them out of goblets each more valuable
than the entire royal cellar.

What, too, was to be said of the apartments, the hangings, the pictures,
the servants and officers, of every description, of his household? What
of the mode of service in which etiquette was replaced by order;
stiff formality by personal, unrestrained comfort; the happiness and
contentment of the guest became the supreme law of all who obeyed
the host? The perfect swarm of busily engaged persons moving about
noiselessly; the multitude of guests,--who were, however, even
less numerous than the servants who waited on them,--the myriad of
exquisitely prepared dishes, of gold and silver vases; the floods of
dazzling light, the masses of unknown flowers of which the hot-houses
had been despoiled, redundant with luxuriance of unequaled scent and
beauty; the perfect harmony of the surroundings, which, indeed, was
no more than the prelude of the promised _fete_, charmed all who were
there; and they testified their admiration over and over again, not
by voice or gesture, but by deep silence and rapt attention, those
two languages of the courtier which acknowledge the hand of no master
powerful enough to restrain them.

As for the king, his eyes filled with tears; he dared not look at the
queen. Anne of Austria, whose pride was superior to that of any creature
breathing, overwhelmed her host by the contempt with which she treated
everything handed to her. The young queen, kind-hearted by nature and
curious by disposition, praised Fouquet, ate with an exceedingly good
appetite, and asked the names of the strange fruits as they were placed
upon the table. Fouquet replied that he was not aware of their names.
The fruits came from his own stores; he had often cultivated them
himself, having an intimate acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic
fruits and plants. The king felt and appreciated the delicacy of the
replies, but was only the more humiliated; he thought the queen a little
too familiar in her manners, and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno
a little too much, in being too proud and haughty; his chief anxiety,
however, was himself, that he might remain cold and distant in his
behavior, bordering lightly the limits of supreme disdain or simple
admiration.

But Fouquet had foreseen all this; he was, in fact, one of those men who
foresee everything. The king had expressly declared that, so long as he
remained under Fouquet’s roof, he did not wish his own different repasts
to be served in accordance with the usual etiquette, and that he would,
consequently, dine with the rest of society; but by the thoughtful
attention of the surintendant, the king’s dinner was served up
separately, if one may so express it, in the middle of the general
table; the dinner, wonderful in every respect, from the dishes of
which was composed, comprised everything the king liked and generally
preferred to anything else. Louis had no excuse--he, indeed, who had the
keenest appetite in his kingdom--for saying that he was not hungry.
Nay, M. Fouquet did even better still; he certainly, in obedience to the
king’s expressed desire, seated himself at the table, but as soon as
the soups were served, he arose and personally waited on the king, while
Madame Fouquet stood behind the queen-mother’s armchair. The disdain
of Juno and the sulky fits of temper of Jupiter could not resist this
excess of kindly feeling and polite attention. The queen ate a biscuit
dipped in a glass of San-Lucar wine; and the king ate of everything,
saying to M. Fouquet: “It is impossible, monsieur le surintendant, to
dine better anywhere.” Whereupon the whole court began, on all sides, to
devour the dishes spread before them with such enthusiasm that it looked
as though a cloud of Egyptian locusts was settling down on green and
growing crops.

As soon, however, as his hunger was appeased, the king became morose
and overgloomed again; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he
fancied he had previously manifested, and particularly on account of
the deferential manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet.
D’Artagnan, who ate a good deal and drank but little, without allowing
it to be noticed, did not lose a single opportunity, but made a great
number of observations which he turned to good profit.

When the supper was finished, the king expressed a wish not to lose the
promenade. The park was illuminated; the moon, too, as if she had placed
herself at the orders of the lord of Vaux, silvered the trees and
lake with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent light. The air was
strangely soft and balmy; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through
the thickly set avenues yielded luxuriously to the feet. The _fete_ was
complete in every respect, for the king, having met La Valliere in one
of the winding paths of the wood, was able to press her hand and say,
“I love you,” without any one overhearing him except M. d’Artagnan, who
followed, and M. Fouquet, who preceded him.

The dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on. The king
having requested to be shown to his room, there was immediately a
movement in every direction. The queens passed to their own apartments,
accompanied by them music of theorbos and lutes; the king found his
musketeers awaiting him on the grand flight of steps, for M. Fouquet had
brought them on from Melun and had invited them to supper. D’Artagnan’s
suspicions at once disappeared. He was weary, he had supped well, and
wished, for once in his life, thoroughly to enjoy a _fete_ given by a
man who was in every sense of the word a king. “M. Fouquet,” he said,
“is the man for me.”

The king was conducted with the greatest ceremony to the chamber of
Morpheus, of which we owe some cursory description to our readers. It
was the handsomest and largest in the palace. Lebrun had painted on the
vaulted ceiling the happy as well as the unhappy dreams which Morpheus
inflicts on kings as well as on other men. Everything that sleep gives
birth to that is lovely, its fairy scenes, its flowers and nectar, the
wild voluptuousness or profound repose of the senses, had the painter
elaborated on his frescoes. It was a composition as soft and pleasing
in one part as dark and gloomy and terrible in another. The poisoned
chalice, the glittering dagger suspended over the head of the sleeper;
wizards and phantoms with terrific masks, those half-dim shadows more
alarming than the approach of fire or the somber face of midnight,
these, and such as these, he had made the companions of his more
pleasing pictures. No sooner had the king entered his room than a cold
shiver seemed to pass through him, and on Fouquet asking him the cause
of it, the king replied, as pale as death:

“I am sleepy, that is all.”

“Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?”

“No; I have to talk with a few persons first,” said the king. “Will you
have the goodness to tell M. Colbert I wish to see him.”

Fouquet bowed and left the room.



Chapter XIV. A Gascon, and a Gascon and a Half.

D’Artagnan had determined to lose no time, and in fact he never was in
the habit of doing so. After having inquired for Aramis, he had looked
for him in every direction until he had succeeded in finding him.
Besides, no sooner had the king entered Vaux, than Aramis had retired to
his own room, meditating, doubtless, some new piece of gallant attention
for his majesty’s amusement. D’Artagnan desired the servants to announce
him, and found on the second story (in a beautiful room called the Blue
Chamber, on account of the color of its hangings) the bishop of Vannes
in company with Porthos and several of the modern Epicureans. Aramis
came forward to embrace his friend, and offered him the best seat. As
it was after awhile generally remarked among those present that the
musketeer was reserved, and wished for an opportunity for conversing
secretly with Aramis, the Epicureans took their leave. Porthos, however,
did not stir; for true it is that, having dined exceedingly well, he was
fast asleep in his armchair; and the freedom of conversation therefore
was not interrupted by a third person. Porthos had a deep, harmonious
snore, and people might talk in the midst of its loud bass without fear
of disturbing him. D’Artagnan felt that he was called upon to open the
conversation.

“Well, and so we have come to Vaux,” he said.

“Why, yes, D’Artagnan. And how do you like the place?”

“Very much, and I like M. Fouquet, also.”

“Is he not a charming host?”

“No one could be more so.”

“I am told that the king began by showing great distance of manner
towards M. Fouquet, but that his majesty grew much more cordial
afterwards.”

“You did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?”

“No; I was engaged with the gentlemen who have just left the room about
the theatrical performances and the tournaments which are to take place
to-morrow.”

“Ah, indeed! you are the comptroller-general of the _fetes_ here, then?”

“You know I am a friend of all kinds of amusement where the exercise of
the imagination is called into activity; I have always been a poet in
one way or another.”

“Yes, I remember the verses you used to write, they were charming.”

“I have forgotten them, but I am delighted to read the verses of others,
when those others are known by the names of Moliere, Pelisson, La
Fontaine, etc.”

“Do you know what idea occurred to me this evening, Aramis?”

“No; tell me what it was, for I should never be able to guess it, you
have so many.”

“Well, the idea occurred to me, that the true king of France is not
Louis XIV.”

“_What!_” said Aramis, involuntarily, looking the musketeer full in the
eyes.

“No, it is Monsieur Fouquet.”

Aramis breathed again, and smiled. “Ah! you are like all the rest,
jealous,” he said. “I would wager that it was M. Colbert who turned
that pretty phrase.” D’Artagnan, in order to throw Aramis off his guard,
related Colbert’s misadventures with regard to the _vin de Melun_.

“He comes of a mean race, does Colbert,” said Aramis.

“Quite true.”

“When I think, too,” added the bishop, “that that fellow will be your
minister within four months, and that you will serve him as blindly as
you did Richelieu or Mazarin--”

“And as you serve M. Fouquet,” said D’Artagnan.

“With this difference, though, that M. Fouquet is not M. Colbert.”

“True, true,” said D’Artagnan, as he pretended to become sad and full of
reflection; and then, a moment after, he added, “Why do you tell me that
M. Colbert will be minister in four months?”

“Because M. Fouquet will have ceased to be so,” replied Aramis.

“He will be ruined, you mean?” said D’Artagnan.

“Completely so.”

“Why does he give these _fetes_, then?” said the musketeer, in a tone so
full of thoughtful consideration, and so well assumed, that the bishop
was for the moment deceived by it. “Why did you not dissuade him from
it?”

The latter part of the phrase was just a little too much, and Aramis’s
former suspicions were again aroused. “It is done with the object of
humoring the king.”

“By ruining himself?”

“Yes, by ruining himself for the king.”

“A most eccentric, one might say, sinister calculation, that.”

“Necessity, necessity, my friend.”

“I don’t see that, dear Aramis.”

“Do you not? Have you not remarked M. Colbert’s daily increasing
antagonism, and that he is doing his utmost to drive the king to get rid
of the superintendent?”

“One must be blind not to see it.”

“And that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet?”

“That is well known.”

“What likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed
against a man who will have spent everything he had to please him?”

“True, true,” said D’Artagnan, slowly, hardly convinced, yet curious
to broach another phase of the conversation. “There are follies, and
follies,” he resumed, “and I do not like those you are committing.”

“What do you allude to?”

“As for the banquet, the ball, the concert, the theatricals, the
tournaments, the cascades, the fireworks, the illuminations, and the
presents--these are well and good, I grant; but why were not these
expenses sufficient? Why was it necessary to have new liveries and
costumes for your whole household?”

“You are quite right. I told M. Fouquet that myself; he replied, that
if he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly erected chateau,
from the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars; completely new
inside and out; and that, as soon as the king had left, he would burn
the whole building and its contents, in order that it might not be made
use of by any one else.”

“How completely Spanish!”

“I told him so, and he then added this: ‘Whoever advises me to spare
expense, I shall look upon as my enemy.’”

“It is positive madness; and that portrait, too!”

“What portrait?” said Aramis.

“That of the king, and the surprise as well.”

“What surprise?”

“The surprise you seem to have in view, and on account of which you took
some specimens away, when I met you at Percerin’s.” D’Artagnan paused.
The shaft was discharged, and all he had to do was to wait and watch its
effect.

“That is merely an act of graceful attention,” replied Aramis.

D’Artagnan went up to his friend, took hold of both his hands, and
looking him full in the eyes, said, “Aramis, do you still care for me a
very little?”

“What a question to ask!”

“Very good. One favor, then. Why did you take some patterns of the
king’s costumes at Percerin’s?”

“Come with me and ask poor Lebrun, who has been working upon them for
the last two days and nights.”

“Aramis, that may be truth for everybody else, but for me--”

“Upon my word, D’Artagnan, you astonish me.”

“Be a little considerate. Tell me the exact truth; you would not like
anything disagreeable to happen to me, would you?”

“My dear friend, you are becoming quite incomprehensible. What suspicion
can you have possibly got hold of?”

“Do you believe in my instinctive feelings? Formerly you used to have
faith in them. Well, then, an instinct tells me that you have some
concealed project on foot.”

“I--a project?”

“I am convinced of it.”

“What nonsense!”

“I am not only sure of it, but I would even swear it.”

“Indeed, D’Artagnan, you cause me the greatest pain. Is it likely, if I
have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should
tell you about it? If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed,
should I not have long ago divulged it?”

“No, Aramis, no. There are certain projects which are never revealed
until the favorable opportunity arrives.”

“In that case, my dear fellow,” returned the bishop, laughing, “the only
thing now is, that the ‘opportunity’ has not yet arrived.”

D’Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression. “Oh, friendship,
friendship!” he said, “what an idle word you are! Here is a man who, if
I were but to ask it, would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my
sake.”

“You are right,” said Aramis, nobly.

“And this man, who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me,
will not open up before me the least corner in his heart. Friendship, I
repeat, is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow--a lure, like everything
else in this bright, dazzling world.”

“It is not thus you should speak of _our_ friendship,” replied the
bishop, in a firm, assured voice; “for ours is not of the same nature as
those of which you have been speaking.”

“Look at us, Aramis; three out of the old ‘four.’ You are deceiving me;
I suspect you; and Porthos is fast asleep. An admirable trio of friends,
don’t you think so? What an affecting relic of the former dear old
times!”

“I can only tell you one thing, D’Artagnan, and I swear it on the Bible:
I love you just as I used to do. If I ever suspect you, it is on account
of others, and not on account of either of us. In everything I may do,
and should happen to succeed in, you will find your fourth. Will you
promise me the same favor?”

“If I am not mistaken, Aramis, your words--at the moment you pronounce
them--are full of generous feeling.”

“Such a thing is very possible.”

“You are conspiring against M. Colbert. If that be all, _mordioux_, tell
me so at once. I have the instrument in my own hand, and will pull out
the tooth easily enough.”

Aramis could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his
haughty features. “And supposing that I were conspiring against Colbert,
what harm would there be in _that?_”

“No, no; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand,
and it was not on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of
the king’s costumes. Oh! Aramis, we are not enemies, remember--we are
brothers. Tell me what you wish to undertake, and, upon the word of a
D’Artagnan, if I cannot help you, I will swear to remain neuter.”

“I am undertaking nothing,” said Aramis.

“Aramis, a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of
light within my darkness: it is a voice that has never yet deceived me.
It is the king you are conspiring against.”

“The king?” exclaimed the bishop, pretending to be annoyed.

“Your face will not convince me; the king, I repeat.”

“Will you help me?” said Aramis, smiling ironically.

“Aramis, I will do more than help you--I will do more than remain
neuter--I will save you.”

“You are mad, D’Artagnan.”

“I am the wiser of the two, in this matter.”

“You to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king!”

“Who spoke of such a thing?” smiled the musketeer.

“Well, let us understand one another. I do not see what any one can
do to a legitimate king as ours is, if he does not assassinate him.”
 D’Artagnan did not say a word. “Besides, you have your guards and your
musketeers here,” said the bishop.

“True.”

“You are not in M. Fouquet’s house, but in your own.”

“True; but in spite of that, Aramis, grant me, for pity’s sake, one
single word of a true friend.”

“A true friend’s word is ever truth itself. If I think of touching, even
with my finger, the son of Anne of Austria, the true king of this realm
of France--if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before
his throne--if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow, here at Vaux,
will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed--may Heaven’s
lightning blast me where I stand!” Aramis had pronounced these words
with his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom, where
D’Artagnan, seated with his back towards the alcove, could not suspect
that any one was lying concealed. The earnestness of his words, the
studied slowness with which he pronounced them, the solemnity of his
oath, gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction. He took hold
of both Aramis’s hands, and shook them cordially. Aramis had endured
reproaches without turning pale, and had blushed as he listened to words
of praise. D’Artagnan, deceived, did him honor; but D’Artagnan, trustful
and reliant, made him feel ashamed. “Are you going away?” he said, as he
embraced him, in order to conceal the flush on his face.

“Yes. Duty summons me. I have to get the watch-word. It seems I am to be
lodged in the king’s ante-room. Where does Porthos sleep?”

“Take him away with you, if you like, for he rumbles through his sleepy
nose like a park of artillery.”

“Ah! he does not stay with you, then?” said D’Artagnan.

“Not the least in the world. He has a chamber to himself, but I don’t
know where.”

“Very good!” said the musketeer; from whom this separation of the two
associates removed his last suspicion, and he touched Porthos lightly
on the shoulder; the latter replied by a loud yawn. “Come,” said
D’Artagnan.

“What, D’Artagnan, my dear fellow, is that you? What a lucky chance! Oh,
yes--true; I have forgotten; I am at the _fete_ at Vaux.”

“Yes; and your beautiful dress, too.”

“Yes, it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere,
was it not?”

“Hush!” said Aramis. “You are walking so heavily you will make the
flooring give way.”

“True,” said the musketeer; “this room is above the dome, I think.”

“And I did not choose it for a fencing-room, I assure you,” added the
bishop. “The ceiling of the king’s room has all the lightness and calm
of wholesome sleep. Do not forget, therefore, that my flooring is merely
the covering of his ceiling. Good night, my friends, and in ten minutes
I shall be asleep myself.” And Aramis accompanied them to the door,
laughing quietly all the while. As soon as they were outside, he bolted
the door, hurriedly; closed up the chinks of the windows, and then
called out, “Monseigneur!--monseigneur!” Philippe made his appearance
from the alcove, as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the
bed.

“M. d’Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions, it seems,” he said.

“Ah!--you recognized M. d’Artagnan, then?”

“Before you called him by his name, even.”

“He is your captain of musketeers.”

“He is very devoted to _me_,” replied Philippe, laying a stress upon the
personal pronoun.

“As faithful as a dog; but he bites sometimes. If D’Artagnan does not
recognize you before _the other_ has disappeared, rely upon D’Artagnan
to the end of the world; for in that case, if he has seen nothing, he
will keep his fidelity. If he sees, when it is too late, he is a Gascon,
and will never admit that he has been deceived.”

“I thought so. What are we to do, now?”

“Sit in this folding-chair. I am going to push aside a portion of the
flooring; you will look through the opening, which answers to one of the
false windows made in the dome of the king’s apartment. Can you see?”

“Yes,” said Philippe, starting as at the sight of an enemy; “I see the
king!”

“What is he doing?”

“He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him.”

“M. Fouquet?”

“No, no; wait a moment--”

“Look at the notes and the portraits, my prince.”

“The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M.
Colbert.”

“Colbert sit down in the king’s presence!” exclaimed Aramis. “It is
impossible.”

“Look.”

Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring. “Yes,” he said.
“Colbert himself. Oh, monseigneur! what can we be going to hear--and
what can result from this intimacy?”

“Nothing good for M. Fouquet, at all events.”

The prince did not deceive himself.

We have seen that Louis XIV. had sent for Colbert, and Colbert had
arrived. The conversation began between them by the king according to
him one of the highest favors that he had ever done; it was true the
king was alone with his subject. “Colbert,” said he, “sit down.”

The intendant, overcome with delight, for he feared he was about to be
dismissed, refused this unprecedented honor.

“Does he accept?” said Aramis.

“No, he remains standing.”

“Let us listen, then.” And the future king and the future pope listened
eagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet, ready to crush
them when they liked.

“Colbert,” said the king, “you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day.”

“I know it, sire.”

“Very good; I like that answer. Yes, you knew it, and there was courage
in the doing of it.”

“I ran the risk of displeasing your majesty, but I risked, also, the
concealment of your best interests.”

“What! you were afraid of something on _my_ account?”

“I was, sire, even if it were nothing more than an indigestion,” said
Colbert; “for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the
one of to-day, unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good
living.” Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon
the king; and Louis XIV., who was the vainest and the most fastidiously
delicate man in his kingdom, forgave Colbert the joke.

“The truth is,” he said, “that M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal.
Tell me, Colbert, where does he get all the money required for this
enormous expenditure,--can you tell?”

“Yes, I do know, sire.”

“Will you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty?”

“Easily; and to the utmost farthing.”

“I know you are very exact.”

“Exactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of
finances.”

“But all are not so.”

“I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips.”

“M. Fouquet, therefore, is rich--very rich, and I suppose every man
knows he is so.”

“Every one, sire; the living as well as the dead.”

“What does that mean, Monsieur Colbert?”

“The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet’s wealth,--they admire and
applaud the result produced; but the dead, wiser and better informed
than we are, know how that wealth was obtained--and they rise up in
accusation.”

“So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other.”

“The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice
it.”

“You have something to say to me more confidentially, I perceive; do not
be afraid, we are quite alone.”

“I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience,
and under the protection of your majesty,” said Colbert, bowing.

“If the dead, therefore, were to speak--”

“They do speak sometimes, sire,--read.”

“Ah!” murmured Aramis, in the prince’s ear, who, close beside him,
listened without losing a syllable, “since you are placed here,
monseigneur, in order to learn your vocation of a king, listen to a
piece of infamy--of a nature truly royal. You are about to be a
witness of one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and
executes. Listen attentively,--you will find your advantage in it.”

The prince redoubled his attention, and saw Louis XIV. take from
Colbert’s hands a letter the latter held out to him.

“The late cardinal’s handwriting,” said the king.

“Your majesty has an excellent memory,” replied Colbert, bowing; “it
is an immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to
recognize handwritings at the first glance.”

The king read Mazarin’s letter, and, as its contents are already known
to the reader, in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de
Chevreuse and Aramis, nothing further would be learned if we stated them
here again.

“I do not quite understand,” said the king, greatly interested.

“Your majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the
public accounts.”

“I see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet.”

“Thirteen millions. A tolerably good sum.”

“Yes. Well, these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of
the account. That is what I do not very well understand. How was this
deficit possible?”

“Possible I do not say; but there is no doubt about fact that it is
really so.”

“You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the
accounts?”

“I do not say so, but the registry does.”

“And this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and
the name of the person with whom it was deposited?”

“As your majesty can judge for yourself.”

“Yes; and the result is, then, that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the
thirteen millions.”

“That results from the accounts, certainly, sire.”

“Well, and, consequently--”

“Well, sire, in that case, inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given
back the thirteen millions, he must have appropriated them to his own
purpose; and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and
a little more as much expense, and make four times as great a display,
as your majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau, where we only spent
three millions altogether, if you remember.”

For a blunderer, the _souvenir_ he had evoked was a rather skillfully
contrived piece of baseness; for by the remembrance of his own _fete_
he, for the first time, perceived its inferiority compared with that of
Fouquet. Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him
at Fontainebleau, and, as a good financier, returned it with the best
possible interest. Having once disposed the king’s mind in this artful
way, Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him. He felt that
such was the case, for the king, too, had again sunk into a dull and
gloomy state. Colbert awaited the first words from the king’s lips
with as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of
observation.

“Are you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this,
Monsieur Colbert?” said the king, after a few moments’ reflection.

“No, sire, I do not know.”

“Well, then, the fact of the appropriation of the thirteen millions, if
it can be proved--”

“But it is so already.”

“I mean if it were to be declared and certified, M. Colbert.”

“I think it will be to-morrow, if your majesty--”

“Were we not under M. Fouquet’s roof, you were going to say, perhaps,”
 replied the king, with something of nobility in his demeanor.

“The king is in his own palace wherever he may be--especially in houses
which the royal money has constructed.”

“I think,” said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis, “that the architect
who planned this dome ought, anticipating the use it could be put to at
a future opportunity, so to have contrived that it might be made to fall
upon the heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert.”

“I think so too,” replied Aramis; “but M. Colbert is so very _near the
king_ at this moment.”

“That is true, and that would open the succession.”

“Of which your younger brother would reap all the advantage,
monseigneur. But stay, let us keep quiet, and go on listening.”

“We shall not have long to listen,” said the young prince.

“Why not, monseigneur?”

“Because, if I were king, I should make no further reply.”

“And what would you do?”

“I should wait until to-morrow morning to give myself time for
reflection.”

Louis XIV. at last raised his eyes, and finding Colbert attentively
waiting for his next remarks, said, hastily, changing the conversation,
“M. Colbert, I perceive it is getting very late, and I shall now retire
to bed. By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my mind.”

“Very good, sire,” returned Colbert, greatly incensed, although he
restrained himself in the presence of the king.

The king made a gesture of adieu, and Colbert withdrew with a respectful
bow. “My attendants!” cried the king; and, as they entered the
apartment, Philippe was about to quit his post of observation.

“A moment longer,” said Aramis to him, with his accustomed gentleness of
manner; “what has just now taken place is only a detail, and to-morrow
we shall have no occasion to think anything more about it; but the
ceremony of the king’s retiring to rest, the etiquette observed in
addressing the king, that indeed is of the greatest importance. Learn,
sire, and study well how you ought to go to bed of a night. Look! look!”



Chapter XV. Colbert.

History will tell us, or rather history has told us, of the various
events of the following day, of the splendid _fetes_ given by the
surintendant to his sovereign. Nothing but amusement and delight was
allowed to prevail throughout the whole of the following day; there
was a promenade, a banquet, a comedy to be acted, and a comedy, too,
in which, to his great amazement, Porthos recognized “M. Coquelin de
Voliere” as one of the actors, in the piece called “Les Facheux.” Full
of preoccupation, however, from the scene of the previous evening, and
hardly recovered from the effects of the poison which Colbert had then
administered to him, the king, during the whole of the day, so brilliant
in its effects, so full of unexpected and startling novelties, in which
all the wonders of the “Arabian Night’s Entertainments” seemed to be
reproduced for his especial amusement--the king, we say, showed himself
cold, reserved, and taciturn. Nothing could smooth the frowns upon
his face; every one who observed him noticed that a deep feeling of
resentment, of remote origin, increased by slow degrees, as the source
becomes a river, thanks to the thousand threads of water that increase
its body, was keenly alive in the depths of the king’s heart. Towards
the middle of the day only did he begin to resume a little serenity of
manner, and by that time he had, in all probability, made up his mind.
Aramis, who followed him step by step in his thoughts, as in his walk,
concluded that the event he was expecting would not be long before it
was announced. This time Colbert seemed to walk in concert with the
bishop of Vannes, and had he received for every annoyance which he
inflicted on the king a word of direction from Aramis, he could not
have done better. During the whole of the day the king, who, in all
probability, wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which
disturbed his mind, seemed to seek La Valliere’s society as actively as
he seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet.
The evening came. The king had expressed a wish not to walk in the park
until after cards in the evening. In the interval between supper and
the promenade, cards and dice were introduced. The king won a thousand
pistoles, and, having won them, put them in his pocket, and then rose,
saying, “And now, gentlemen, to the park.” He found the ladies of the
court were already there. The king, we have before observed, had won a
thousand pistoles, and had put them in his pocket; but M. Fouquet had
somehow contrived to lose ten thousand, so that among the courtiers
there was still left a hundred and ninety thousand francs’ profit to
divide, a circumstance which made the countenances of the courtiers and
the officers of the king’s household the most joyous countenances in
the world. It was not the same, however, with the king’s face; for,
notwithstanding his success at play, to which he was by no means
insensible, there still remained a slight shade of dissatisfaction.
Colbert was waiting for or upon him at the corner of one of the avenues;
he was most probably waiting there in consequence of a rendezvous which
had been given him by the king, as Louis XIV., who had avoided him, or
who had seemed to avoid him, suddenly made him a sign, and they then
struck into the depths of the park together. But La Valliere, too, had
observed the king’s gloomy aspect and kindling glances; she had remarked
this--and as nothing which lay hidden or smoldering in his heart
was hidden from the gaze of her affection, she understood that this
repressed wrath menaced some one; she prepared to withstand the current
of his vengeance, and intercede like an angel of mercy. Overcome by
sadness, nervously agitated, deeply distressed at having been so long
separated from her lover, disturbed at the sight of the emotion she
had divined, she accordingly presented herself to the king with an
embarrassed aspect, which in his then disposition of mind the king
interpreted unfavorably. Then, as they were alone--nearly alone,
inasmuch as Colbert, as soon as he perceived the young girl approaching,
had stopped and drawn back a dozen paces--the king advanced towards
La Valliere and took her by the hand. “Mademoiselle,” he said to her,
“should I be guilty of an indiscretion if I were to inquire if you were
indisposed? for you seem to breathe as if you were oppressed by some
secret cause of uneasiness, and your eyes are filled with tears.”

“Oh! sire, if I be indeed so, and if my eyes are indeed full of tears, I
am sorrowful only at the sadness which seems to oppress your majesty.”

“My sadness? You are mistaken, mademoiselle; no, it is not sadness I
experience.”

“What is it, then, sire?”

“Humiliation.”

“Humiliation? oh! sire, what a word for you to use!”

“I mean, mademoiselle, that wherever I may happen to be, no one else
ought to be the master. Well, then, look round you on every side, and
judge whether I am not eclipsed--I, the king of France--before the
monarch of these wide domains. Oh!” he continued, clenching his hands
and teeth, “when I think that this king--”

“Well, sire?” said Louise, terrified.

“--That this king is a faithless, unworthy servant, who grows proud and
self-sufficient upon the strength of property that belongs to me, and
which he has stolen. And therefore I am about to change this impudent
minister’s _fete_ into sorrow and mourning, of which the nymph of Vaux,
as the poets say, shall not soon lose the remembrance.”

“Oh! your majesty--”

“Well, mademoiselle, are you about to take M. Fouquet’s part?” said
Louis, impatiently.

“No, sire; I will only ask whether you are well informed. Your majesty
has more than once learned the value of accusations made at court.”

Louis XIV. made a sign for Colbert to approach. “Speak, Monsieur
Colbert,” said the young prince, “for I almost believe that Mademoiselle
de la Valliere has need of your assistance before she can put any faith
in the king’s word. Tell mademoiselle what M. Fouquet has done; and you,
mademoiselle, will perhaps have the kindness to listen. It will not be
long.”

Why did Louis XIV. insist upon it in such a manner? A very simple
reason--his heart was not at rest, his mind was not thoroughly
convinced; he imagined there lay some dark, hidden, tortuous intrigue
behind these thirteen millions of francs; and he wished that the
pure heart of La Valliere, which had revolted at the idea of theft
or robbery, should approve--even were it only by a single word--the
resolution he had taken, and which, nevertheless, he hesitated before
carrying into execution.

“Speak, monsieur,” said La Valliere to Colbert, who had advanced;
“speak, since the king wishes me to listen to you. Tell me, what is the
crime with which M. Fouquet is charged?”

“Oh! not very heinous, mademoiselle,” he returned, “a mere abuse of
confidence.”

“Speak, speak, Colbert; and when you have related it, leave us, and go
and inform M. d’Artagnan that I have certain orders to give him.”

“M. d’Artagnan, sire!” exclaimed La Valliere; “but why send for M.
d’Artagnan? I entreat you to tell me.”

“_Pardieu!_ in order to arrest this haughty, arrogant Titan who, true to
his menace, threatens to scale my heaven.”

“Arrest M. Fouquet, do you say?”

“Ah! does that surprise you?”

“In his own house!”

“Why not? If he be guilty, he is as guilty in his own house as anywhere
else.”

“M. Fouquet, who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign.”

“In plain truth, mademoiselle, it seems as if you were defending this
traitor.”

Colbert began to chuckle silently. The king turned round at the sound of
this suppressed mirth.

“Sire,” said La Valliere, “it is not M. Fouquet I am defending; it is
yourself.”

“Me! you are defending me?”

“Sire, you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order.”

“Dishonor myself!” murmured the king, turning pale with anger. “In plain
truth, mademoiselle, you show a strange persistence in what you say.”

“If I do, sire, my only motive is that of serving your majesty,” replied
the noble-hearted girl: “for that I would risk, I would sacrifice my
very life, without the least reserve.”

Colbert seemed inclined to grumble and complain. La Valliere, that
timid, gentle lamb, turned round upon him, and with a glance like
lightning imposed silence upon him. “Monsieur,” she said, “when the
king acts well, whether, in doing so, he does either myself or those
who belong to me an injury, I have nothing to say; but were the king to
confer a benefit either upon me or mine, and if he acted badly, I should
tell him so.”

“But it appears to me, mademoiselle,” Colbert ventured to say, “that I
too love the king.”

“Yes, monseigneur, we both love him, but each in a different manner,”
 replied La Valliere, with such an accent that the heart of the young
king was powerfully affected by it. “I love him so deeply, that the
whole world is aware of it; so purely, that the king himself does not
doubt my affection. He is my king and my master; I am the least of all
his servants. But whoso touches his honor assails my life. Therefore, I
repeat, that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet
under his own roof.”

Colbert hung down his head, for he felt that the king had abandoned him.
However, as he bent his head, he murmured, “Mademoiselle, I have only
one word to say.”

“Do not say it, then, monsieur; for I would not listen to it. Besides,
what could you have to tell me? That M. Fouquet has been guilty of
certain crimes? I believe he has, because the king has said so; and,
from the moment the king said, ‘I think so,’ I have no occasion for
other lips to say, ‘I affirm it.’ But, were M. Fouquet the vilest of
men, I should say aloud, ‘M. Fouquet’s person is sacred to the king
because he is the guest of M. Fouquet. Were his house a den of thieves,
were Vaux a cave of coiners or robbers, his home is sacred, his palace
is inviolable, since his wife is living in it; and that is an asylum
which even executioners would not dare to violate.’”

La Valliere paused, and was silent. In spite of himself the king could
not but admire her; he was overpowered by the passionate energy of her
voice; by the nobleness of the cause she advocated. Colbert yielded,
overcome by the inequality of the struggle. At last the king breathed
again more freely, shook his head, and held out his hand to La Valliere.
“Mademoiselle,” he said, gently, “why do you decide against me? Do you
know what this wretched fellow will do, if I give him time to breathe
again?”

“Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?”

“Should he escape, and take to flight?” exclaimed Colbert.

“Well, monsieur, it will always remain on record, to the king’s eternal
honor, that he allowed M. Fouquet to flee; and the more guilty he may
have been, the greater will the king’s honor and glory appear, compared
with such unnecessary misery and shame.”

Louis kissed La Valliere’s hand, as he knelt before her.

“I am lost,” thought Colbert; then suddenly his face brightened up
again. “Oh! no, no, aha, old fox!--not yet,” he said to himself.

And while the king, protected from observation by the thick covert of an
enormous lime, pressed La Valliere to his breast, with all the ardor of
ineffable affection, Colbert tranquilly fumbled among the papers in his
pocket-book and drew out of it a paper folded in the form of a letter,
somewhat yellow, perhaps, but one that must have been most precious,
since the intendant smiled as he looked at it; he then bent a look, full
of hatred, upon the charming group which the young girl and the king
formed together--a group revealed but for a moment, as the light of the
approaching torches shone upon it. Louis noticed the light reflected
upon La Valliere’s white dress. “Leave me, Louise,” he said, “for some
one is coming.”

“Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, some one is coming,” cried Colbert, to
expedite the young girl’s departure.

Louise disappeared rapidly among the trees; and then, as the king, who
had been on his knees before the young girl, was rising from his humble
posture, Colbert exclaimed, “Ah! Mademoiselle de la Valliere has let
something fall.”

“What is it?” inquired the king.

“A paper--a letter--something white; look there, sire.”

The king stooped down immediately and picked up the letter, crumpling it
in his hand, as he did so; and at the same moment the torches arrived,
inundating the blackness of the scene with a flood of light as bight as
day.



Chapter XVI. Jealousy.

The torches we have just referred to, the eager attention every one
displayed, and the new ovation paid to the king by Fouquet, arrived in
time to suspend the effect of a resolution which La Valliere had already
considerably shaken in Louis XIV.’s heart. He looked at Fouquet with a
feeling almost of gratitude for having given La Valliere an opportunity
of showing herself so generously disposed, so powerful in the influence
she exercised over his heart. The moment of the last and greatest
display had arrived. Hardly had Fouquet conducted the king towards
the chateau, when a mass of fire burst from the dome of Vaux, with a
prodigious uproar, pouring a flood of dazzling cataracts of rays on
every side, and illumining the remotest corners of the gardens. The
fireworks began. Colbert, at twenty paces from the king, who was
surrounded and _feted_ by the owner of Vaux, seemed, by the obstinate
persistence of his gloomy thoughts, to do his utmost to recall Louis’s
attention, which the magnificence of the spectacle was already, in his
opinion, too easily diverting. Suddenly, just as Louis was on the point
of holding it out to Fouquet, he perceived in his hand the paper which,
as he believed, La Valliere had dropped at his feet as she hurried away.
The still stronger magnet of love drew the young prince’s attention
towards the _souvenir_ of his idol; and, by the brilliant light, which
increased momentarily in beauty, and drew from the neighboring villages
loud cheers of admiration, the king read the letter, which he supposed
was a loving and tender epistle La Valliere had destined for him. But as
he read it, a death-like pallor stole over his face, and an expression
of deep-seated wrath, illumined by the many-colored fire which gleamed
so brightly, soaringly around the scene, produced a terrible spectacle,
which every one would have shuddered at, could they only have read into
his heart, now torn by the most stormy and most bitter passions. There
was no truce for him now, influenced as he was by jealousy and mad
passion. From the very moment when the dark truth was revealed to
him, every gentler feeling seemed to disappear; pity, kindness of
consideration, the religion of hospitality, all were forgotten. In
the bitter pang which wrung his heart, he, still too weak to hide his
sufferings, was almost on the point of uttering a cry of alarm, and
calling his guards to gather round him. This letter which Colbert had
thrown down at the king’s feet, the reader has doubtlessly guessed, was
the same that had disappeared with the porter Toby at Fontainebleau,
after the attempt which Fouquet had made upon La Valliere’s heart.
Fouquet saw the king’s pallor, and was far from guessing the evil;
Colbert saw the king’s anger, and rejoiced inwardly at the approach
of the storm. Fouquet’s voice drew the young prince from his wrathful
reverie.

“What is the matter, sire?” inquired the superintendent, with an
expression of graceful interest.

Louis made a violent effort over himself, as he replied, “Nothing.”

“I am afraid your majesty is suffering?”

“I am suffering, and have already told you so, monsieur; but it is
nothing.”

And the king, without waiting for the termination of the fireworks,
turned towards the chateau. Fouquet accompanied him, and the whole court
followed, leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for their own
amusement. The superintendent endeavored again to question Louis XIV.,
but did not succeed in obtaining a reply. He imagined there had been
some misunderstanding between Louis and La Valliere in the park,
which had resulted in a slight quarrel; and that the king, who was not
ordinarily sulky by disposition, but completely absorbed by his passion
for La Valliere, had taken a dislike to every one because his mistress
had shown herself offended with him. This idea was sufficient to console
him; he had even a friendly and kindly smile for the young king, when
the latter wished him good night. This, however, was not all the king
had to submit to; he was obliged to undergo the usual ceremony, which on
that evening was marked by close adherence to the strictest etiquette.
The next day was the one fixed for the departure; it was but proper that
the guests should thank their host, and show him a little attention
in return for the expenditure of his twelve millions. The only remark,
approaching to amiability, which the king could find to say to M.
Fouquet, as he took leave of him, were in these words, “M. Fouquet,
you shall hear from me. Be good enough to desire M. d’Artagnan to come
here.”

But the blood of Louis XIV., who had so profoundly dissimulated his
feelings, boiled in his veins; and he was perfectly willing to order
M. Fouquet to be put an end to with the same readiness, indeed, as his
predecessor had caused the assassination of le Marechal d’Ancre; and so
he disguised the terrible resolution he had formed beneath one of those
royal smiles which, like lightning-flashes, indicated _coups d’etat_.
Fouquet took the king’s hand and kissed it; Louis shuddered throughout
his whole frame, but allowed M. Fouquet to touch his hand with his lips.
Five minutes afterwards, D’Artagnan, to whom the royal order had been
communicated, entered Louis XIV.’s apartment. Aramis and Philippe were
in theirs, still eagerly attentive, and still listening with all their
ears. The king did not even give the captain of the musketeers time
to approach his armchair, but ran forward to meet him. “Take care,” he
exclaimed, “that no one enters here.”

“Very good, sire,” replied the captain, whose glance had for a long time
past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance. He gave
the necessary order at the door; but, returning to the king, he said,
“Is there something fresh the matter, your majesty?”

“How many men have you here?” inquired the king, without making any
other reply to the question addressed to him.

“What for, sire?”

“How many men have you, I say?” repeated the king, stamping upon the
ground with his foot.

“I have the musketeers.”

“Well; and what others?”

“Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss.”

“How many men will be required to--”

“To do what, sire?” replied the musketeer, opening his large, calm eyes.

“To arrest M. Fouquet.”

D’Artagnan fell back a step.

“To arrest M. Fouquet!” he burst forth.

“Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?” exclaimed the king, in
tones of cold, vindictive passion.

“I never say that anything is impossible,” replied D’Artagnan, wounded
to the quick.

“Very well; do it, then.”

D’Artagnan turned on his heel, and made his way towards the door; it was
but a short distance, and he cleared it in half a dozen paces; when he
reached it he suddenly paused, and said, “Your majesty will forgive me,
but, in order to effect this arrest, I should like written directions.”

“For what purpose--and since when has the king’s word been insufficient
for you?”

“Because the word of a king, when it springs from a feeling of anger,
may possibly change when the feeling changes.”

“A truce to set phrases, monsieur; you have another thought besides
that?”

“Oh, I, at least, have certain thoughts and ideas, which, unfortunately,
others have not,” D’Artagnan replied, impertinently.

The king, in the tempest of his wrath, hesitated, and drew back in the
face of D’Artagnan’s frank courage, just as a horse crouches on his
haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider. “What is
your thought?” he exclaimed.

“This, sire,” replied D’Artagnan: “you cause a man to be arrested when
you are still under his roof; and passion is alone the cause of that.
When your anger shall have passed, you will regret what you have done;
and then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature. If that,
however, should fail to be a reparation, it will at least show us that
the king was wrong to lose his temper.”

“Wrong to lose his temper!” cried the king, in a loud, passionate voice.
“Did not my father, my grandfathers, too, before me, lose their temper
at times, in Heaven’s name?”

“The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their
temper except when under the protection of their own palace.”

“The king is master wherever he may be.”

“That is a flattering, complimentary phrase which cannot proceed from
any one but M. Colbert; but it happens not to be the truth. The king is
at home in every man’s house when he has driven its owner out of it.”

The king bit his lips, but said nothing.

“Can it be possible?” said D’Artagnan; “here is a man who is positively
ruining himself in order to please you, and you wish to have him
arrested! _Mordioux!_ Sire, if my name was Fouquet, and people treated
me in that manner, I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of
fireworks and other things, and I would set fire to them, and send
myself and everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky. But it is all
the same; it is your wish, and it shall be done.”

“Go,” said the king; “but have you men enough?”

“Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me? Arrest M.
Fouquet! why, that is so easy that a very child might do it! It is like
drinking a glass of wormwood; one makes an ugly face, and that is all.”

“If he defends himself?”

“He! it is not at all likely. Defend himself when such extreme harshness
as you are going to practice makes the man a very martyr! Nay, I am sure
that if he has a million of francs left, which I very much doubt, he
would be willing enough to give it in order to have such a termination
as this. But what does that matter? it shall be done at once.”

“Stay,” said the king; “do not make his arrest a public affair.”

“That will be more difficult.”

“Why so?”

“Because nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of
a thousand enthusiastic guests who surround him, and say, ‘In the king’s
name, I arrest you.’ But to go up to him, to turn him first one way
and then another, to drive him up into one of the corners of the
chess-board, in such a way that he cannot escape; to take him away from
his guests, and keep him a prisoner for you, without one of them, alas!
having heard anything about it; that, indeed, is a genuine difficulty,
the greatest of all, in truth; and I hardly see how it is to be done.”

“You had better say it is impossible, and you will have finished much
sooner. Heaven help me, but I seem to be surrounded by people who
prevent me doing what I wish.”

“I do not prevent your doing anything. Have you indeed decided?”

“Take care of M. Fouquet, until I shall have made up my mind by
to-morrow morning.”

“That shall be done, sire.”

“And return, when I rise in the morning, for further orders; and now
leave me to myself.”

“You do not even want M. Colbert, then?” said the musketeer, firing his
last shot as he was leaving the room. The king started. With his whole
mind fixed on the thought of revenge, he had forgotten the cause and
substance of the offense.

“No, no one,” he said; “no one here! Leave me.”

D’Artagnan quitted the room. The king closed the door with his own
hands, and began to walk up and down his apartment at a furious pace,
like a wounded bull in an arena, trailing from his horn the colored
streamers and the iron darts. At last he began to take comfort in the
expression of his violent feelings.

“Miserable wretch that he is! not only does he squander my finances, but
with his ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries, friends, generals,
artists, and all, and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most
attached. This is the reason that perfidious girl so boldly took
his part! Gratitude! and who can tell whether it was not a stronger
feeling--love itself?” He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest
reflections. “A satyr!” he thought, with that abhorrent hate with which
young men regard those more advanced in life, who still think of love.
“A man who has never found opposition or resistance in any one, who
lavishes his gold and jewels in every direction, and who retains his
staff of painters in order to take the portraits of his mistresses
in the costume of goddesses.” The king trembled with passion as he
continued, “He pollutes and profanes everything that belongs to me! He
destroys everything that is mine. He will be my death at last, I
know. That man is too much for me; he is my mortal enemy, but he
shall forthwith fall! I hate him--I hate him--I hate him!” and as he
pronounced these words, he struck the arm of the chair in which he was
sitting violently, over and over again, and then rose like one in an
epileptic fit. “To-morrow! to-morrow! oh, happy day!” he murmured, “when
the sun rises, no other rival shall that brilliant king of space possess
but me. That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject
ruin my anger shall have wrought, they will be forced to confess at
last and at least that I am indeed greater than he.” The king, who was
incapable of mastering his emotions any longer, knocked over with a blow
of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside, and in the very
bitterness of anger, almost weeping, and half-suffocated, he threw
himself on his bed, dressed as he was, and bit the sheets in his
extremity of passion, trying to find repose of body at least there. The
bed creaked beneath his weight, and with the exception of a few broken
sounds, emerging, or, one might say, exploding, from his overburdened
chest, absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus.



Chapter XVII. High Treason.

The ungovernable fury which took possession of the king at the sight and
at the perusal of Fouquet’s letter to La Valliere by degrees subsided
into a feeling of pain and extreme weariness. Youth, invigorated by
health and lightness of spirits, requiring soon that what it loses
should be immediately restored--youth knows not those endless, sleepless
nights which enable us to realize the fable of the vulture unceasingly
feeding on Prometheus. In cases where the man of middle life, in his
acquired strength of will and purpose, and the old, in their state of
natural exhaustion, find incessant augmentation of their bitter sorrow,
a young man, surprised by the sudden appearance of misfortune, weakens
himself in sighs, and groans, and tears, directly struggling with his
grief, and is thereby far sooner overthrown by the inflexible enemy with
whom he is engaged. Once overthrown, his struggles cease. Louis could
not hold out more than a few minutes, at the end of which he had ceased
to clench his hands, and scorch in fancy with his looks the invisible
objects of his hatred; he soon ceased to attack with his violent
imprecations not M. Fouquet alone, but even La Valliere herself; from
fury he subsided into despair, and from despair to prostration. After he
had thrown himself for a few minutes to and fro convulsively on his
bed, his nerveless arms fell quietly down; his head lay languidly on
his pillow; his limbs, exhausted with excessive emotion, still trembled
occasionally, agitated by muscular contractions; while from his breast
faint and infrequent sighs still issued. Morpheus, the tutelary deity of
the apartment, towards whom Louis raised his eyes, wearied by his anger
and reconciled by his tears, showered down upon him the sleep-inducing
poppies with which his hands are ever filled; so presently the monarch
closed his eyes and fell asleep. Then it seemed to him, as it often
happens in that first sleep, so light and gentle, which raises the body
above the couch, and the soul above the earth--it seemed to him, we say,
as if the god Morpheus, painted on the ceiling, looked at him with eyes
resembling human eyes; that something shone brightly, and moved to and
fro in the dome above the sleeper; that the crowd of terrible dreams
which thronged together in his brain, and which were interrupted for
a moment, half revealed a human face, with a hand resting against the
mouth, and in an attitude of deep and absorbed meditation. And strange
enough, too, this man bore so wonderful a resemblance to the king
himself, that Louis fancied he was looking at his own face reflected in
a mirror; with the exception, however, that the face was saddened by a
feeling of the profoundest pity. Then it seemed to him as if the dome
gradually retired, escaping from his gaze, and that the figures and
attributes painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the distance
became more and more remote. A gentle, easy movement, as regular as
that by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves, had succeeded to the
immovableness of the bed. Doubtless the king was dreaming, and in this
dream the crown of gold, which fastened the curtains together, seemed
to recede from his vision, just as the dome, to which it remained
suspended, had done, so that the winged genius which, with both its
hand, supported the crown, seemed, though vainly so, to call upon the
king, who was fast disappearing from it. The bed still sunk. Louis,
with his eyes open, could not resist the deception of this cruel
hallucination. At last, as the light of the royal chamber faded away
into darkness and gloom, something cold, gloomy, and inexplicable in
its nature seemed to infect the air. No paintings, nor gold, nor velvet
hangings, were visible any longer, nothing but walls of a dull gray
color, which the increasing gloom made darker every moment. And yet the
bed still continued to descend, and after a minute, which seemed in its
duration almost an age to the king, it reached a stratum of air, black
and chill as death, and then it stopped. The king could no longer see
the light in his room, except as from the bottom of a well we can see
the light of day. “I am under the influence of some atrocious dream,” he
thought. “It is time to awaken from it. Come! let me wake.”

Every one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys; there
is hardly a person who, in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is
suffocating, has not said to himself, by the help of that light which
still burns in the brain when every human light is extinguished, “It is
nothing but a dream, after all.” This was precisely what Louis XIV. said
to himself; but when he said, “Come, come! wake up,” he perceived that
not only was he already awake, but still more, that he had his eyes open
also. And then he looked all round him. On his right hand and on his
left two armed men stood in stolid silence, each wrapped in a huge
cloak, and the face covered with a mask; one of them held a small lamp
in his hand, whose glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king
could look upon. Louis could not help saying to himself that his dream
still lasted, and that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was
to move his arms or to say something aloud; he darted from his bed, and
found himself upon the damp, moist ground. Then, addressing himself to
the man who held the lamp in his hand, he said:

“What is this, monsieur, and what is the meaning of this jest?”

“It is no jest,” replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the
lantern.

“Do you belong to M. Fouquet?” inquired the king, greatly astonished at
his situation.

“It matters very little to whom we belong,” said the phantom; “we are
your masters now, that is sufficient.”

The king, more impatient than intimidated, turned to the other masked
figure. “If this is a comedy,” he said, “you will tell M. Fouquet that I
find it unseemly and improper, and that I command it should cease.”

The second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a
man of huge stature and vast circumference. He held himself erect and
motionless as any block of marble. “Well!” added the king, stamping his
foot, “you do not answer!”

“We do not answer you, my good monsieur,” said the giant, in a
stentorian voice, “because there is nothing to say.”

“At least, tell me what you want,” exclaimed Louis, folding his arms
with a passionate gesture.

“You will know by and by,” replied the man who held the lamp.

“In the meantime tell me where I am.”

“Look.”

Louis looked all round him; but by the light of the lamp which the
masked figure raised for the purpose, he could perceive nothing but the
damp walls which glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the
snail. “Oh--oh!--a dungeon,” cried the king.

“No, a subterranean passage.”

“Which leads--?”

“Will you be good enough to follow us?”

“I shall not stir from hence!” cried the king.

“If you are obstinate, my dear young friend,” replied the taller of the
two, “I will lift you up in my arms, and roll you up in your own cloak,
and if you should happen to be stifled, why--so much the worse for you.”

As he said this, he disengaged from beneath his cloak a hand of which
Milo of Crotona would have envied him the possession, on the day when
he had that unhappy idea of rending his last oak. The king dreaded
violence, for he could well believe that the two men into whose power he
had fallen had not gone so far with any idea of drawing back, and
that they would consequently be ready to proceed to extremities, if
necessary. He shook his head and said: “It seems I have fallen into the
hands of a couple of assassins. Move on, then.”

Neither of the men answered a word to this remark. The one who carried
the lantern walked first, the king followed him, while the second masked
figure closed the procession. In this manner they passed along a winding
gallery of some length, with as many staircases leading out of it as
are to be found in the mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe’s
creation. All these windings and turnings, during which the king heard
the sound of running water _over his head_, ended at last in a long
corridor closed by an iron door. The figure with the lamp opened the
door with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle, where, during
the whole of the brief journey, the king had heard them rattle. As soon
as the door was opened and admitted the air, Louis recognized the balmy
odors that trees exhale in hot summer nights. He paused, hesitatingly,
for a moment or two; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him
out of the subterranean passage.

“Another blow,” said the king, turning towards the one who had just had
the audacity to touch his sovereign; “what do you intend to do with the
king of France?”

“Try to forget that word,” replied the man with the lamp, in a tone
which as little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of
Minos.

“You deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just
made use of,” said the giant, as he extinguished the lamp his companion
handed to him; “but the king is too kind-hearted.”

Louis, at that threat, made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if
he meditated flight; but the giant’s hand was in a moment placed on
his shoulder, and fixed him motionless where he stood. “But tell me, at
least, where we are going,” said the king.

“Come,” replied the former of the two men, with a kind of respect in his
manner, and leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be
in waiting.

The carriage was completely concealed amid the trees. Two horses, with
their feet fettered, were fastened by a halter to the lower branches of
a large oak.

“Get in,” said the same man, opening the carriage-door and letting down
the step. The king obeyed, seated himself at the back of the carriage,
the padded door of which was shut and locked immediately upon him and
his guide. As for the giant, he cut the fastenings by which the horses
were bound, harnessed them himself, and mounted on the box of the
carriage, which was unoccupied. The carriage set off immediately at a
quick trot, turned into the road to Paris, and in the forest of Senart
found a relay of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the
first horses had been, and without a postilion. The man on the box
changed the horses, and continued to follow the road towards Paris with
the same rapidity, so that they entered the city about three o’clock in
the morning. They carriage proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine,
and, after having called out to the sentinel, “By the king’s order,” the
driver conducted the horses into the circular inclosure of the Bastile,
looking out upon the courtyard, called La Cour du Gouvernement. There
the horses drew up, reeking with sweat, at the flight of steps, and a
sergeant of the guard ran forward. “Go and wake the governor,” said the
coachman in a voice of thunder.

With the exception of this voice, which might have been heard at the
entrance of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, everything remained as calm in
the carriage as in the prison. Ten minutes afterwards, M. de Baisemeaux
appeared in his dressing-gown on the threshold of the door. “What is the
matter now?” he asked; “and whom have you brought me there?”

The man with the lantern opened the carriage-door, and said two or three
words to the one who acted as driver, who immediately got down from his
seat, took up a short musket which he kept under his feet, and placed
its muzzle on his prisoner’s chest.

“And fire at once if he speaks!” added aloud the man who alighted from
the carriage.

“Very good,” replied his companion, without another remark.

With this recommendation, the person who had accompanied the king in the
carriage ascended the flight of steps, at the top of which the governor
was awaiting him. “Monsieur d’Herblay!” said the latter.

“Hush!” said Aramis. “Let us go into your room.”

“Good heavens! what brings you here at this hour?”

“A mistake, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,” Aramis replied, quietly.
“It appears that you were quite right the other day.”

“What about?” inquired the governor.

“About the order of release, my dear friend.”

“Tell me what you mean, monsieur--no, monseigneur,” said the governor,
almost suffocated by surprise and terror.

“It is a very simple affair: you remember, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that
an order of release was sent to you.”

“Yes, for Marchiali.”

“Very good! we both thought that it was for Marchiali?”

“Certainly; you will recollect, however, that I would not credit it, but
that you compelled me to believe it.”

“Oh! Baisemeaux, my good fellow, what a word to make use of!--strongly
recommended, that was all.”

“Strongly recommended, yes; strongly recommended to give him up to you;
and that you carried him off with you in your carriage.”

“Well, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, it was a mistake; it was
discovered at the ministry, so that I now bring you an order from the
king to set at liberty Seldon,--that poor Seldon fellow, you know.”

“Seldon! are you sure this time?”

“Well, read it yourself,” added Aramis, handing him the order.

“Why,” said Baisemeaux, “this order is the very same that has already
passed through my hands.”

“Indeed?”

“It is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening. _Parbleu!_ I
recognize it by the blot of ink.”

“I do not know whether it is that; but all I know is, that I bring it
for you.”

“But then, what about the other?”

“What other?”

“Marchiali.”

“I have got him here with me.”

“But that is not enough for me. I require a new order to take him back
again.”

“Don’t talk such nonsense, my dear Baisemeaux; you talk like a child!
Where is the order you received respecting Marchiali?”

Baisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out. Aramis seized hold
of it, coolly tore it in four pieces, held them to the lamp, and burnt
them. “Good heavens! what are you doing?” exclaimed Baisemeaux, in an
extremity of terror.

“Look at your position quietly, my good governor,” said Aramis, with
imperturbable self-possession, “and you will see how very simple the
whole affair is. You no longer possess any order justifying Marchiali’s
release.”

“I am a lost man!”

“Far from it, my good fellow, since I have brought Marchiali back to
you, and all accordingly is just the same as if he had never left.”

“Ah!” said the governor, completely overcome by terror.

“Plain enough, you see; and you will go and shut him up immediately.”

“I should think so, indeed.”

“And you will hand over this Seldon to me, whose liberation is
authorized by this order. Do you understand?”

“I--I--”

“You do understand, I see,” said Aramis. “Very good.” Baisemeaux clapped
his hands together.

“But why, at all events, after having taken Marchiali away from me, do
you bring him back again?” cried the unhappy governor, in a paroxysm of
terror, and completely dumbfounded.

“For a friend such as you are,” said Aramis--“for so devoted a servant,
I have no secrets;” and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux’s ear, as
he said, in a low tone of voice, “you know the resemblance between that
unfortunate fellow, and--”

“And the king?--yes!”

“Very good; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to
persist--Can you guess what?”

“How is it likely I should guess?”

“To persist in saying that he was king of France; to dress himself up in
clothes like those of the king; and then pretend to assume that he was
the king himself.”

“Gracious heavens!”

“That is the reason why I have brought him back again, my dear friend.
He is mad and lets every one see how mad he is.”

“What is to be done, then?”

“That is very simple; let no one hold any communication with him. You
understand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king’s
ears, the king, who had pitied his terrible affliction, and saw that
all his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude, became perfectly
furious; so that, now--and remember this very distinctly, dear Monsieur
de Baisemeaux, for it concerns you most closely--so that there is now, I
repeat, sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow
him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself. You
understand, Baisemeaux, sentence of death!”

“You need not ask me whether I understand.”

“And now, let us go down, and conduct this poor devil back to his
dungeon again, unless you prefer he should come up here.”

“What would be the good of that?”

“It would be better, perhaps, to enter his name in the prison-book at
once!”

“Of course, certainly; not a doubt of it.”

“In that case, have him up.”

Baisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung, as
a warning to every one to retire, in order to avoid meeting a prisoner,
about whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery. Then, when the
passages were free, he went to take the prisoner from the carriage, at
whose breast Porthos, faithful to the directions which had been given
him, still kept his musket leveled. “Ah! is that you, miserable wretch?”
 cried the governor, as soon as he perceived the king. “Very good, very
good.” And immediately, making the king get out of the carriage, he led
him, still accompanied by Porthos, who had not taken off his mask, and
Aramis, who again resumed his, up the stairs, to the second Bertaudiere,
and opened the door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had
bemoaned his existence. The king entered the cell without pronouncing a
single word: he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily.
Baisemeaux shut the door upon him, turned the key twice in the lock,
and then returned to Aramis. “It is quite true,” he said, in a low tone,
“that he bears a striking resemblance to the king; but less so than you
said.”

“So that,” said Aramis, “you would not have been deceived by the
substitution of the one for the other?”

“What a question!”

“You are a most valuable fellow, Baisemeaux,” said Aramis; “and now, set
Seldon free.”

“Oh, yes. I was going to forget that. I will go and give orders at
once.”

“Bah! to-morrow will be time enough.”

“To-morrow!--oh, no. This very minute.”

“Well; go off to your affairs, I will go away to mine. But it is quite
understood, is it not?”

“What ‘is quite understood’?”

“That no one is to enter the prisoner’s cell, expect with an order from
the king; an order which I will myself bring.”

“Quite so. Adieu, monseigneur.”

Aramis returned to his companion. “Now, Porthos, my good fellow, back
again to Vaux, and as fast as possible.”

“A man is light and easy enough, when he has faithfully served his king;
and, in serving him, saved his country,” said Porthos. “The horses will
be as light as if our tissues were constructed of the wind of heaven.
So let us be off.” And the carriage, lightened of a prisoner, who might
well be--as he in fact was--very heavy in the sight of Aramis, passed
across the drawbridge of the Bastile, which was raised again immediately
behind it.



Chapter XVIII. A Night at the Bastile.

Pain, anguish, and suffering in human life are always in proportion to
the strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say
that Heaven always apportions to a man’s capability of endurance the
anguish with which he afflicts him; for that, indeed, would not be true,
since Heaven permits the existence of death, which is, sometimes, the
only refuge open to those who are too closely pressed--too bitterly
afflicted, as far as the body is concerned. Suffering is in proportion
to the strength which has been accorded; in other words, the weak suffer
more, where the trial is the same, than the strong. And what are the
elementary principles, we may ask, that compose human strength? Is it
not--more than anything else--exercise, habit, experience? We shall not
even take the trouble to demonstrate this, for it is an axiom in morals,
as in physics. When the young king, stupefied and crushed in every sense
and feeling, found himself led to a cell in the Bastile, he fancied
death itself is but a sleep; that it, too, has its dreams as well; that
the bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux; that death
had resulted from the occurrence; and that, still carrying out his
dream, the king, Louis XIV., now no longer living, was dreaming one
of those horrors, impossible to realize in life, which is termed
dethronement, imprisonment, and insult towards a sovereign who formerly
wielded unlimited power. To be present at--an actual witness, too--of
this bitterness of death; to float, indecisively, in an incomprehensible
mystery, between resemblance and reality; to hear everything, to
see everything, without interfering in a single detail of agonizing
suffering, was--so the king thought within himself--a torture far
more terrible, since it might last forever. “Is this what is termed
eternity--hell?” he murmured, at the moment the door was closed upon
him, which we remember Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands. He did
not even look round him; and in the room, leaning with his back
against the wall, he allowed himself to be carried away by the terrible
supposition that he was already dead, as he closed his eyes, in order to
avoid looking upon something even worse still. “How can I have died?” he
said to himself, sick with terror. “The bed might have been let down by
some artificial means? But no! I do not remember to have felt a bruise,
nor any shock either. Would they not rather have poisoned me at my
meals, or with the fumes of wax, as they did my ancestress, Jeanne
d’Albret?” Suddenly, the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet
cloak upon Louis’s shoulders. “I have seen,” he said, “my father lying
dead upon his funeral couch, in his regal robes. That pale face, so calm
and worn; those hands, once so skillful, lying nerveless by his side;
those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death; nothing there betokened
a sleep that was disturbed by dreams. And yet, how numerous were the
dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse--him whom so many
others had preceded, hurried away by him into eternal death! No, that
king was still the king: he was enthroned still upon that funeral
couch, as upon a velvet armchair; he had not abdicated one title of his
majesty. God, who had not punished him, cannot, will not punish me, who
have done nothing.” A strange sound attracted the young man’s attention.
He looked round him, and saw on the mantel-shelf, just below an enormous
crucifix, coarsely painted in fresco on the wall, a rat of enormous size
engaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread, but fixing all the time, an
intelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell. The
king could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust: he moved
back towards the door, uttering a loud cry; and as if he but needed this
cry, which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously, to recognize
himself, Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his
natural senses. “A prisoner!” he cried. “I--I, a prisoner!” He looked
round him for a bell to summon some one to him. “There are no bells in
the Bastile,” he said, “and it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned. In
what way can I have been made a prisoner? It must have been owing to a
conspiracy of M. Fouquet. I have been drawn to Vaux, as to a snare. M.
Fouquet cannot be acting alone in this affair. His agent--That voice
that I but just now heard was M. d’Herblay’s; I recognized it. Colbert
was right, then. But what is Fouquet’s object? To reign in my place and
stead?--Impossible. Yet who knows!” thought the king, relapsing into
gloom again. “Perhaps my brother, the Duc d’Orleans, is doing that which
my uncle wished to do during the whole of his life against my father.
But the queen?--My mother, too? And La Valliere? Oh! La Valliere, she
will have been abandoned to Madame. Dear, dear girl! Yes, it is--it must
be so. They have shut her up as they have me. We are separated forever!”
 And at this idea of separation the poor lover burst into a flood of
tears and sobs and groans.

“There is a governor in this place,” the king continued, in a fury of
passion; “I will speak to him, I will summon him to me.”

He called--no voice replied to his. He seized hold of his chair, and
hurled it against the massive oaken door. The wood resounded against the
door, and awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the
staircase; but from a human creature, none.

This was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was
held at the Bastile. Therefore, when his first fit of anger had passed
away, having remarked a barred window through which there passed a
stream of light, lozenge-shaped, which must be, he knew, the bright orb
of approaching day, Louis began to call out, at first gently enough,
then louder and louder still; but no one replied. Twenty other attempts
which he made, one after another, obtained no other or better success.
His blood began to boil within him, and mount to his head. His nature
was such, that, accustomed to command, he trembled at the idea of
disobedience. The prisoner broke the chair, which was too heavy for him
to lift, and made use of it as a battering ram to strike against the
door. He struck so loudly, and so repeatedly, that the perspiration soon
began to pour down his face. The sound became tremendous and continuous;
certain stifled, smothered cries replied in different directions. This
sound produced a strange effect upon the king. He paused to listen;
it was the voice of the prisoners, formerly his victims, now his
companions. The voices ascended like vapors through the thick ceilings
and the massive walls, and rose in accusations against the author of
this noise, as doubtless their sighs and tears accused, in whispered
tones, the author of their captivity. After having deprived so many
people of their liberty, the king came among them to rob them of their
rest. This idea almost drove him mad; it redoubled his strength, or
rather his will, bent upon obtaining some information, or a conclusion
to the affair. With a portion of the broken chair he recommenced the
noise. At the end of an hour, Louis heard something in the corridor,
behind the door of his cell, and a violent blow, which was returned upon
the door itself, made him cease his own.

“Are you mad?” said a rude, brutal voice. “What is the matter with you
this morning?”

“This morning!” thought the king; but he said aloud, politely,
“Monsieur, are you the governor of the Bastile?”

“My good fellow, your head is out of sorts,” replied the voice; “but
that is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance. Be
quiet; _mordioux!_”

“Are you the governor?” the king inquired again.

He heard a door on the corridor close; the jailer had just left, not
condescending to reply a single word. When the king had assured himself
of his departure, his fury knew no longer any bounds. As agile as a
tiger, he leaped from the table to the window, and struck the iron bars
with all his might. He broke a pane of glass, the pieces of which
fell clanking into the courtyard below. He shouted with increasing
hoarseness, “The governor, the governor!” This excess lasted fully an
hour, during which time he was in a burning fever. With his hair in
disorder and matted on his forehead, his dress torn and covered with
dust and plaster, his linen in shreds, the king never rested until
his strength was utterly exhausted, and it was not until then that he
clearly understood the pitiless thickness of the walls, the impenetrable
nature of the cement, invincible to every influence but that of time,
and that he possessed no other weapon but despair. He leaned his
forehead against the door, and let the feverish throbbings of his heart
calm by degrees; it had seemed as if one single additional pulsation
would have made it burst.

“A moment will come when the food which is given to the prisoners will
be brought to me. I shall then see some one, I shall speak to him, and
get an answer.”

And the king tried to remember at what hour the first repast of the
prisoners was served at the Bastile; he was ignorant even of this
detail. The feeling of remorse at this remembrance smote him like the
thrust of a dagger, that he should have lived for five and twenty years
a king, and in the enjoyment of every happiness, without having bestowed
a moment’s thought on the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived
of their liberty. The king blushed for very shame. He felt that Heaven,
in permitting this fearful humiliation, did no more than render to the
man the same torture as had been inflicted by that man upon so many
others. Nothing could be more efficacious for reawakening his mind to
religious influences than the prostration of his heart and mind and soul
beneath the feeling of such acute wretchedness. But Louis dared not even
kneel in prayer to God to entreat him to terminate his bitter trial.

“Heaven is right,” he said; “Heaven acts wisely. It would be cowardly
to pray to Heaven for that which I have so often refused my own
fellow-creatures.”

He had reached this stage of his reflections, that is, of his agony of
mind, when a similar noise was again heard behind his door, followed
this time by the sound of the key in the lock, and of the bolts being
withdrawn from their staples. The king bounded forward to be nearer to
the person who was about to enter, but, suddenly reflecting that it was
a movement unworthy of a sovereign, he paused, assumed a noble and calm
expression, which for him was easy enough, and waited with his back
turned towards the window, in order, to some extent, to conceal his
agitation from the eyes of the person who was about to enter. It was
only a jailer with a basket of provisions. The king looked at the man
with restless anxiety, and waited until he spoke.

“Ah!” said the latter, “you have broken your chair. I said you had done
so! Why, you have gone quite mad.”

“Monsieur,” said the king, “be careful what you say; it will be a very
serious affair for you.”

The jailer placed the basket on the table, and looked at his prisoner
steadily. “What do you say?” he said.

“Desire the governor to come to me,” added the king, in accents full of
calm and dignity.

“Come, my boy,” said the turnkey, “you have always been very quiet and
reasonable, but you are getting vicious, it seems, and I wish you
to know it in time. You have broken your chair, and made a great
disturbance; that is an offense punishable by imprisonment in one of the
lower dungeons. Promise me not to begin over again, and I will not say a
word about it to the governor.”

“I wish to see the governor,” replied the king, still governing his
passions.

“He will send you off to one of the dungeons, I tell you; so take care.”

“I insist upon it, do you hear?”

“Ah! ah! your eyes are becoming wild again. Very good! I shall take away
your knife.”

And the jailer did what he said, quitted the prisoner, and closed the
door, leaving the king more astounded, more wretched, more isolated than
ever. It was useless, though he tried it, to make the same noise again
on his door, and equally useless that he threw the plates and dishes out
of the window; not a single sound was heard in recognition. Two hours
afterwards he could not be recognized as a king, a gentleman, a man, a
human being; he might rather be called a madman, tearing the door with
his nails, trying to tear up the flooring of his cell, and uttering such
wild and fearful cries that the old Bastile seemed to tremble to its
very foundations for having revolted against its master. As for the
governor, the jailer did not even think of disturbing him; the turnkeys
and the sentinels had reported the occurrence to him, but what was the
good of it? Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?
and were not the walls still stronger? M. de Baisemeaux, thoroughly
impressed with what Aramis had told him, and in perfect conformity with
the king’s order, hoped only that one thing might happen; namely, that
the madman Marchiali might be mad enough to hang himself to the canopy
of his bed, or to one of the bars of the window. In fact, the prisoner
was anything but a profitable investment for M. Baisemeaux, and became
more annoying than agreeable to him. These complications of Seldon
and Marchiali--the complications first of setting at liberty and then
imprisoning again, the complications arising from the strong likeness in
question--had at last found a very proper _denouement_. Baisemeaux
even thought he had remarked that D’Herblay himself was not altogether
dissatisfied with the result.

“And then, really,” said Baisemeaux to his next in command, “an ordinary
prisoner is already unhappy enough in being a prisoner; he suffers quite
enough, indeed, to induce one to hope, charitably enough, that his death
may not be far distant. With still greater reason, accordingly, when the
prisoner has gone mad, and might bite and make a terrible disturbance
in the Bastile; why, in such a case, it is not simply an act of mere
charity to wish him dead; it would be almost a good and even commendable
action, quietly to have him put out of his misery.”

And the good-natured governor thereupon sat down to his late breakfast.



Chapter XIX. The Shadow of M. Fouquet.

D’Artagnan, still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just
had with the king, could not resist asking himself if he were really in
possession of his senses, if he were really and truly at Vaux; if he,
D’Artagnan, were really the captain of the musketeers, and M. Fouquet
the owner of the chateau in which Louis XIV. was at that moment
partaking of his hospitality. These reflections were not those of a
drunken man, although everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux, and
the surintendant’s wines had met with a distinguished reception at the
_fete_. The Gascon, however, was a man of calm self-possession; and no
sooner did he touch his bright steel blade, than he knew how to adopt
morally the cold, keen weapon as his guide of action.

“Well,” he said, as he quitted the royal apartment, “I seem now to
be mixed up historically with the destinies of the king and of the
minister; it will be written, that M. d’Artagnan, a younger son of a
Gascon family, placed his hand on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet,
the surintendant of the finances of France. My descendants, if I have
any, will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest
will confer, just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with
regard to the estates of the poor Marechal d’Ancre. But the thing is,
how best to execute the king’s directions in a proper manner. Any man
would know how to say to M. Fouquet, ‘Your sword, monsieur.’ But it
is not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet without
others knowing anything about it. How am I to manage, then, so that M.
le surintendant pass from the height of favor to the direst disgrace;
that Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him; that after having been
steeped to his lips, as it were, in all the perfumes and incense of
Ahasuerus, he is transferred to the gallows of Haman; in other words, of
Enguerrand de Marigny?” And at this reflection, D’Artagnan’s brow became
clouded with perplexity. The musketeer had certain scruples on the
matter, it must be admitted. To deliver up to death (for not a doubt
existed that Louis hated Fouquet mortally) the man who had just shown
himself so delightful and charming a host in every way, was a real
insult to one’s conscience. “It almost seems,” said D’Artagnan to
himself, “that if I am not a poor, mean, miserable fellow, I should let
M. Fouquet know the opinion the king has about him. Yet, if I betray
my master’s secret, I shall be a false-hearted, treacherous knave, a
traitor, too, a crime provided for and punishable by military laws--so
much so, indeed, that twenty times, in former days when wars were rife,
I have seen many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing, in
but a small degree, what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a
great scale now. No, I think that a man of true readiness of wit ought
to get out of this difficulty with more skill than that. And now, let
us admit that I do possess a little readiness of invention; it is not at
all certain, though, for, after having for forty years absorbed so
large a quantity, I shall be lucky if there were to be a pistole’s-worth
left.” D’Artagnan buried his head in his hands, tore at his mustache
in sheer vexation, and added, “What can be the reason of M. Fouquet’s
disgrace? There seem to be three good ones: the first, because M.
Colbert doesn’t like him; the second, because he wished to fall in love
with Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and lastly, because the king likes M.
Colbert and loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Oh! he is lost! But shall
I put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey
to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks? For shame! If he
be dangerous, I will lay him low enough; if, however, he be
only persecuted, I will look on. I have come to such a decisive
determination, that neither king nor living man shall change my mind.
If Athos were here, he would do as I have done. Therefore, instead of
going, in cold blood, up to M. Fouquet, and arresting him off-hand and
shutting him up altogether, I will try and conduct myself like a man who
understands what good manners are. People will talk about it, of course;
but they shall talk well of it, I am determined.” And D’Artagnan,
drawing by a gesture peculiar to himself his shoulder-belt over his
shoulder, went straight off to M. Fouquet, who, after he had taken
leave of his guests, was preparing to retire for the night and to sleep
tranquilly after the triumphs of the day. The air was still perfumed,
or infected, whichever way it may be considered, with the odors of
the torches and the fireworks. The wax-lights were dying away in their
sockets, the flowers fell unfastened from the garlands, the groups of
dancers and courtiers were separating in the salons. Surrounded by his
friends, who complimented him and received his flattering remarks in
return, the surintendant half-closed his wearied eyes. He longed for
rest and quiet; he sank upon the bed of laurels which had been heaped
up for him for so many days past; it might almost have been said that he
seemed bowed beneath the weight of the new debts which he had incurred
for the purpose of giving the greatest possible honor to this _fete_.
Fouquet had just retired to his room, still smiling, but more than
half-asleep. He could listen to nothing more, he could hardly keep his
eyes open; his bed seemed to possess a fascinating and irresistible
attraction for him. The god Morpheus, the presiding deity of the dome
painted by Lebrun, had extended his influence over the adjoining rooms,
and showered down his most sleep-inducing poppies upon the master of the
house. Fouquet, almost entirely alone, was being assisted by his _valet
de chambre_ to undress, when M. d’Artagnan appeared at the entrance of
the room. D’Artagnan had never been able to succeed in making himself
common at the court; and notwithstanding he was seen everywhere and
on all occasions, he never failed to produce an effect wherever and
whenever he made his appearance. Such is the happy privilege of certain
natures, which in that respect resemble either thunder or lightning;
every one recognizes them; but their appearance never fails to arouse
surprise and astonishment, and whenever they occur, the impression is
always left that the last was the most conspicuous or most important.

“What! M. d’Artagnan?” said Fouquet, who had already taken his right arm
out of the sleeve of his doublet.

“At your service,” replied the musketeer.

“Come in, my dear M. d’Artagnan.”

“Thank you.”

“Have you come to criticise the _fete?_ You are ingenious enough in your
criticisms, I know.”

“By no means.”

“Are not your men looked after properly?”

“In every way.”

“You are not comfortably lodged, perhaps?”

“Nothing could be better.”

“In that case, I have to thank you for being so amiably disposed, and I
must not fail to express my obligations to you for all your flattering
kindness.”

These words were as much as to say, “My dear D’Artagnan, pray go to bed,
since you have a bed to lie down on, and let me do the same.”

D’Artagnan did not seem to understand it.

“Are you going to bed already?” he said to the superintendent.

“Yes; have you anything to say to me?”

“Nothing, monsieur, nothing at all. You sleep in this room, then?”

“Yes; as you see.”

“You have given a most charming _fete_ to the king.”

“Do you think so?”

“Oh! beautiful!”

“Is the king pleased?”

“Enchanted.”

“Did he desire you to say as much to me?”

“He would not choose so unworthy a messenger, monseigneur.”

“You do not do yourself justice, Monsieur d’Artagnan.”

“Is that your bed, there?”

“Yes; but why do you ask? Are you not satisfied with your own?”

“My I speak frankly to you?”

“Most assuredly.”

“Well, then, I am not.”

Fouquet started; and then replied, “Will you take my room, Monsieur
d’Artagnan?”

“What! deprive you of it, monseigneur? never!”

“What am I to do, then?”

“Allow me to share yours with you.”

Fouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly. “Ah! ah!” he said, “you have
just left the king.”

“I have, monseigneur.”

“And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room?”

“Monseigneur--”

“Very well, Monsieur d’Artagnan, very well. You are the master here.”

“I assure you, monseigneur, that I do not wish to abuse--”

Fouquet turned to his valet, and said, “Leave us.” When the man had
left, he said to D’Artagnan, “You have something to say to me?”

“I?”

“A man of your superior intelligence cannot have come to talk with a man
like myself, at such an hour as the present, without grave motives.”

“Do not interrogate me.”

“On the contrary. What do you want with me?”

“Nothing more than the pleasure of your society.”

“Come into the garden, then,” said the superintendent suddenly, “or into
the park.”

“No,” replied the musketeer, hastily, “no.”

“Why?”

“The fresh air--”

“Come, admit at once that you arrest me,” said the superintendent to the
captain.

“Never!” said the latter.

“You intend to look after me, then?”

“Yes, monseigneur, I do, upon my honor.”

“Upon your honor--ah! that is quite another thing! So I am to be
arrested in my own house.”

“Do not say such a thing.”

“On the contrary, I will proclaim it aloud.”

“If you do so, I shall be compelled to request you to be silent.”

“Very good! Violence towards me, and in my own house, too.”

“We do not seem to understand one another at all. Stay a moment; there
is a chess-board there; we will have a game, if you have no objections.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan, I am in disgrace, then?”

“Not at all; but--”

“I am prohibited, I suppose, from withdrawing from your sight.”

“I do not understand a word you are saying, monseigneur; and if you wish
me to withdraw, tell me so.”

“My dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, your mode of action is enough to drive
me mad; I was almost sinking for want of sleep, but you have completely
awakened me.”

“I shall never forgive myself, I am sure; and if you wish to reconcile
me with myself, why, go to sleep in your bed in my presence; and I shall
be delighted.”

“I am under surveillance, I see.”

“I will leave the room if you say any such thing.”

“You are beyond my comprehension.”

“Good night, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, as he pretended to withdraw.

Fouquet ran after him. “I will not lie down,” he said. “Seriously, and
since you refuse to treat me as a man, and since you finesse with me, I
will try and set you at bay, as a hunter does a wild boar.”

“Bah!” cried D’Artagnan, pretending to smile.

“I shall order my horses, and set off for Paris,” said Fouquet, sounding
the captain of the musketeers.

“If that be the case, monseigneur, it is very difficult.”

“You will arrest me, then?”

“No, but I shall go along with you.”

“That is quite sufficient, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” returned Fouquet,
coldly. “It was not for nothing you acquired your reputation as a man
of intelligence and resource; but with me all this is quite superfluous.
Let us come to the point. Do me a service. Why do you arrest me? What
have I done?”

“Oh! I know nothing about what you may have done; but I do not arrest
you--this evening, at least!”

“This evening!” said Fouquet, turning pale, “but to-morrow?”

“It is not to-morrow just yet, monseigneur. Who can ever answer for the
morrow?”

“Quick, quick, captain! let me speak to M. d’Herblay.”

“Alas! that is quite impossible, monseigneur. I have strict orders to
see that you hold no communication with any one.”

“With M. d’Herblay, captain--with your friend!”

“Monseigneur, is M. d’Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be
prevented holding any communication?”

Fouquet colored, and then assuming an air of resignation, he said: “You
are right, monsieur; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have
evoked. A fallen man cannot assert his right to anything, even from
those whose fortunes he may have made; for a still stronger reason,
he cannot claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the
happiness of doing a service.”

“Monseigneur!”

“It is perfectly true, Monsieur d’Artagnan; you have always acted in
the most admirable manner towards me--in such a manner, indeed, as most
becomes the man who is destined to arrest me. You, at least, have never
asked me anything.”

“Monsieur,” replied the Gascon, touched by his eloquent and noble tone
of grief, “will you--I ask it as a favor--pledge me your word as a man
of honor that you will not leave this room?”

“What is the use of it, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, since you keep watch
and ward over me? Do you suppose I should contend against the most
valiant sword in the kingdom?”

“It is not that, at all, monseigneur; but that I am going to look for M.
d’Herblay, and, consequently, to leave you alone.”

Fouquet uttered a cry of delight and surprise.

“To look for M. d’Herblay! to leave me alone!” he exclaimed, clasping
his hands together.

“Which is M. d’Herblay’s room? The blue room is it not?”

“Yes, my friend, yes.”

“Your friend! thank you for that word, monseigneur; you confer it upon
me to-day, at least, if you have never done so before.”

“Ah! you have saved me.”

“It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room, and
to return?” said D’Artagnan.

“Nearly so.”

“And then to wake Aramis, who sleeps very soundly, when he is asleep,
I put that down at another five minutes; making a total of fifteen
minutes’ absence. And now, monseigneur, give me your word that you will
not in any way attempt to make your escape, and that when I return I
shall find you here again.”

“I give it, monsieur,” replied Fouquet, with an expression of the
warmest and deepest gratitude.

D’Artagnan disappeared. Fouquet looked at him as he quitted the room,
waited with a feverish impatience until the door was closed behind him,
and as soon as it was shut, flew to his keys, opened two or three secret
doors concealed in various articles of furniture in the room, looked
vainly for certain papers, which doubtless he had left at Saint-Mande,
and which he seemed to regret not having found in them; then hurriedly
seizing hold of letters, contracts, papers, writings, he heaped them
up into a pile, which he burnt in the extremest haste upon the marble
hearth of the fireplace, not even taking time to draw from the interior
of it the vases and pots of flowers with which it was filled. As soon as
he had finished, like a man who has just escaped an imminent danger, and
whose strength abandons him as soon as the danger is past, he sank down,
completely overcome, on a couch. When D’Artagnan returned, he found
Fouquet in the same position; the worthy musketeer had not the slightest
doubt that Fouquet, having given his word, would not even think of
failing to keep it, but he had thought it most likely that Fouquet would
turn his (D’Artagnan’s) absence to the best advantage in getting rid of
all the papers, memorandums, and contracts, which might possibly render
his position, which was even now serious enough, more dangerous than
ever. And so, lifting up his head like a dog who has regained the scent,
he perceived an odor resembling smoke he had relied on finding in the
atmosphere, and having found it, made a movement of his head in token
of satisfaction. As D’Artagnan entered, Fouquet, on his side, raised his
head, and not one of D’Artagnan’s movements escaped him. And then the
looks of the two men met, and they both saw that they had understood
each other without exchanging a syllable.

“Well!” asked Fouquet, the first to speak, “and M. d’Herblay?”

“Upon my word, monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “M. d’Herblay must
be desperately fond of walking out at night, and composing verses
by moonlight in the park of Vaux, with some of your poets, in all
probability, for he is not in his own room.”

“What! not in his own room?” cried Fouquet, whose last hope thus escaped
him; for unless he could ascertain in what way the bishop of Vannes
could assist him, he perfectly well knew that he could expect assistance
from no other quarter.

“Or, indeed,” continued D’Artagnan, “if he is in his own room, he has
very good reasons for not answering.”

“But surely you did not call him in such a manner that he could have
heard you?”

“You can hardly suppose, monseigneur, that having already exceeded my
orders, which forbade me leaving you a single moment--you can hardly
suppose, I say, that I should have been mad enough to rouse the whole
house and allow myself to be seen in the corridor of the bishop of
Vannes, in order that M. Colbert might state with positive certainty
that I gave you time to burn your papers.”

“My papers?”

“Of course; at least that is what I should have done in your place. When
any one opens a door for me I always avail myself of it.”

“Yes, yes, and I thank you, for I have availed myself of it.”

“And you have done perfectly right. Every man has his own peculiar
secrets with which others have nothing to do. But let us return to
Aramis, monseigneur.”

“Well, then, I tell you, you could not have called loud enough, or
Aramis would have heard you.”

“However softly any one may call Aramis, monseigneur, Aramis always
hears when he has an interest in hearing. I repeat what I said
before--Aramis was not in his own room, or Aramis had certain reasons
for not recognizing my voice, of which I am ignorant, and of which you
may be even ignorant yourself, notwithstanding your liege-man is His
Greatness the Lord Bishop of Vannes.”

Fouquet drew a deep sigh, rose from his seat, took three or four turns
in his room, and finished by seating himself, with an expression of
extreme dejection, upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings,
and costliest lace. D’Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the
deepest and sincerest pity.

“I have seen a good many men arrested in my life,” said the musketeer,
sadly; “I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested,
though I was very young then. I have seen M. de Conde arrested with
the princes; I have seen M. de Retz arrested; I have seen M. Broussel
arrested. Stay a moment, monseigneur, it is disagreeable to have to say,
but the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was
that poor fellow Broussel. You were very near doing as he did, putting
your dinner napkin in your portfolio, and wiping your mouth with your
papers. _Mordioux!_ Monseigneur Fouquet, a man like you ought not to be
dejected in this manner. Suppose your friends saw you?”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” returned the surintendant, with a smile full
of gentleness, “you do not understand me; it is precisely because my
friends are not looking on, that I am as you see me now. I do not live,
exist even, isolated from others; I am nothing when left to myself.
Understand that throughout my whole life I have passed every moment of
my time in making friends, whom I hoped to render my stay and support.
In times of prosperity, all these cheerful, happy voices--rendered so
through and by my means--formed in my honor a concert of praise and
kindly actions. In the least disfavor, these humbler voices accompanied
in harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart. Isolation I have never
yet known. Poverty (a phantom I have sometimes beheld, clad in rags,
awaiting me at the end of my journey through life)--poverty has been the
specter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past,
which they poetize and caress, and which has attracted me towards them.
Poverty! I accept it, acknowledge it, receive it, as a disinherited
sister; for poverty is neither solitude, nor exile, nor imprisonment.
Is it likely I shall ever be poor, with such friends as Pelisson, as
La Fontaine, as Moliere? with such a mistress as--Oh! if you knew how
utterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment, and how you, who
separate me from all I love, seem to resemble the image of solitude, of
annihilation--death itself.”

“But I have already told you, Monsieur Fouquet,” replied D’Artagnan,
moved to the depths of his soul, “that you are woefully exaggerating.
The king likes you.”

“No, no,” said Fouquet, shaking his head.

“M. Colbert hates you.”

“M. Colbert! What does that matter to me?”

“He will ruin you.”

“Ah! I defy him to do that, for I am ruined already.”

At this singular confession of the superintendent, D’Artagnan cast
his glance all round the room; and although he did not open his lips,
Fouquet understood him so thoroughly, that he added: “What can be done
with such wealth of substance as surrounds us, when a man can no longer
cultivate his taste for the magnificent? Do you know what good the
greater part of the wealth and the possessions which we rich enjoy,
confer upon us? merely to disgust us, by their very splendor even, with
everything which does not equal it! Vaux! you will say, and the wonders
of Vaux! What of it? What boot these wonders? If I am ruined, how shall
I fill with water the urns which my Naiads bear in their arms, or
force the air into the lungs of my Tritons? To be rich enough, Monsieur
d’Artagnan, a man must be too rich.”

D’Artagnan shook his head.

“Oh! I know very well what you think,” replied Fouquet, quickly. “If
Vaux were yours, you would sell it, and would purchase an estate in the
country; an estate which should have woods, orchards, and land attached,
so that the estate should be made to support its master. With forty
millions you might--”

“Ten millions,” interrupted D’Artagnan.

“Not a million, my dear captain. No one in France is rich enough to give
two millions for Vaux, and to continue to maintain it as I have done; no
one could do it, no one would know how.”

“Well,” said D’Artagnan, “in any case, a million is not abject misery.”

“It is not far from it, my dear monsieur. But you do not understand me.
No; I will not sell my residence at Vaux; I will give it to you, if
you like;” and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the
shoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice.

“Give it to the king; you will make a better bargain.”

“The king does not require me to give it to him,” said Fouquet; “he
will take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace, if it
pleases him to do so; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see
it perish. Do you know, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that if the king did not
happen to be under my roof, I would take this candle, go straight to the
dome, and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and fireworks
which are in reserve there, and would reduce my palace to ashes.”

“Bah!” said the musketeer, negligently. “At all events, you would not be
able to burn the gardens, and that is the finest feature of the place.”

“And yet,” resumed Fouquet, thoughtfully, “what was I saying? Great
heavens! burn Vaux! destroy my palace! But Vaux is not mine; these
wonderful creations are, it is true, the property, as far as sense of
enjoyment goes, of the man who has paid for them; but as far as duration
is concerned, they belong to those who created them. Vaux belongs to
Lebrun, to Lenotre, to Pelisson, to Levau, to La Fontaine, to Moliere;
Vaux belongs to posterity, in fact. You see, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that
my very house has ceased to be my own.”

“That is all well and good,” said D’Artagnan; “the idea is agreeable
enough, and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it. That idea, indeed,
makes me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether; and I now fail to
recognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur. If you are
ruined, monsieur, look at the affair manfully, for you too, _mordioux!_
belong to posterity, and have no right to lessen yourself in any way.
Stay a moment; look at me, I who seem to exercise in some degree a
kind of superiority over you, because I am arresting you; fate, which
distributes their different parts to the comedians of this world,
accorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than
yours has been. I am one of those who think that the parts which kings
and powerful nobles are called upon to act are infinitely of more worth
than the parts of beggars or lackeys. It is far better on the stage--on
the stage, I mean, of another theater than the theater of this world--it
is far better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language, than to
walk the boards shod with a pair of old shoes, or to get one’s backbone
gently polished by a hearty dressing with a stick. In one word, you have
been a prodigal with money, you have ordered and been obeyed--have been
steeped to the lips in enjoyment; while I have dragged my tether after
me, have been commanded and have obeyed, and have drudged my life
away. Well, although I may seem of such trifling importance beside you,
monseigneur, I do declare to you, that the recollection of what I have
done serves me as a spur, and prevents me from bowing my old head too
soon. I shall remain unto the very end a trooper; and when my turn
comes, I shall fall perfectly straight, all in a heap, still alive,
after having selected my place beforehand. Do as I do, Monsieur Fouquet,
you will not find yourself the worse for it; a fall happens only once
in a lifetime to men like yourself, and the chief thing is, to take
it gracefully when the chance presents itself. There is a Latin
proverb--the words have escaped me, but I remember the sense of it very
well, for I have thought over it more than once--which says, ‘The end
crowns the work!’”

Fouquet rose from his seat, passed his arm round D’Artagnan’s neck, and
clasped him in a close embrace, whilst with the other hand he pressed
his hand. “An excellent homily,” he said, after a moment’s pause.

“A soldier’s, monseigneur.”

“You have a regard for me, in telling me all that.”

“Perhaps.”

Fouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more, and then, a moment
after, he said: “Where can M. d’Herblay be? I dare not ask you to send
for him.”

“You would not ask me, because I would not do it, Monsieur Fouquet.
People would learn it, and Aramis, who is not mixed up with the affair,
might possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace.”

“I will wait here till daylight,” said Fouquet.

“Yes; that is best.”

“What shall we do when daylight comes?”

“I know nothing at all about it, monseigneur.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan, will you do me a favor?”

“Most willingly.”

“You guard me, I remain; you are acting in the full discharge of your
duty, I suppose?”

“Certainly.”

“Very good, then; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like; and I
infinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else.”

D’Artagnan bowed to the compliment.

“But, forget that you are Monsieur d’Artagnan, captain of the
musketeers; forget that I am Monsieur Fouquet, surintendant of the
finances; and let us talk about my affairs.”

“That is rather a delicate subject.”

“Indeed?”

“Yes; but, for your sake, Monsieur Fouquet, I will do what may almost be
regarded as an impossibility.”

“Thank you. What did the king say to you?”

“Nothing.”

“Ah! is that the way you talk?”

“The deuce!”

“What do you think of my situation?”

“I do not know.”

“However, unless you have some ill feeling against me--”

“Your position is a difficult one.”

“In what respect?”

“Because you are under your own roof.”

“However difficult it may be, I understand it very well.”

“Do you suppose that, with any one else but yourself, I should have
shown so much frankness?”

“What! so much frankness, do you say? you, who refuse to tell me the
slightest thing?”

“At all events, then, so much ceremony and consideration.”

“Ah! I have nothing to say in that respect.”

“One moment, monseigneur: let me tell you how I should have behaved
towards any one but yourself. It might be that I happened to arrive at
your door just as your guests or your friends had left you--or, if they
had not gone yet, I should wait until they were leaving, and should
then catch them one after the other, like rabbits; I should lock them up
quietly enough, I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor,
and with one hand upon you, before you suspected the slightest thing
amiss, I should keep you safely until my master’s breakfast in the
morning. In this way, I should just the same have avoided all publicity,
all disturbance, all opposition; but there would also have been no
warning for M. Fouquet, no consideration for his feelings, none of those
delicate concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially
courteous in their natures, whenever the decisive moment may arrive. Are
you satisfied with the plan?”

“It makes me shudder.”

“I thought you would not like it. It would have been very disagreeable
to have made my appearance to-morrow, without any preparation, and to
have asked you to deliver up your sword.”

“Oh! monsieur, I should have died of shame and anger.”

“Your gratitude is too eloquently expressed. I have not done enough to
deserve it, I assure you.”

“Most certainly, monsieur, you will never get me to believe that.”

“Well, then, monseigneur, if you are satisfied with what I have done,
and have somewhat recovered from the shock which I prepared you for as
much as I possibly could, let us allow the few hours that remain to pass
away undisturbed. You are harassed, and should arrange your thoughts;
I beg you, therefore, go to sleep, or pretend to go to sleep, either on
your bed, or in your bed; I will sleep in this armchair; and when I fall
asleep, my rest is so sound that a cannon would not wake me.”

Fouquet smiled. “I expect, however,” continued the musketeer, “the case
of a door being opened, whether a secret door, or any other; or the case
of any one going out of, or coming into, the room--for anything like
that my ear is as quick and sensitive as the ear of a mouse. Creaking
noises make me start. It arises, I suppose, from a natural antipathy to
anything of the kind. Move about as much as you like; walk up and down
in any part of the room, write, efface, destroy, burn,--nothing like
that will prevent me from going to sleep or even prevent me from
snoring, but do not touch either the key or the handle of the door, for
I should start up in a moment, and that would shake my nerves and make
me ill.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Fouquet, “you are certainly the most witty
and the most courteous man I ever met with; and you will leave me only
one regret, that of having made your acquaintance so late.”

D’Artagnan drew a deep sigh, which seemed to say, “Alas! you have
perhaps made it too soon.” He then settled himself in his armchair,
while Fouquet, half lying on his bed and leaning on his arm, was
meditating on his misadventures. In this way, both of them, leaving the
candles burning, awaited the first dawn of the day; and when Fouquet
happened to sigh too loudly, D’Artagnan only snored the louder. Not
a single visit, not even from Aramis, disturbed their quietude: not a
sound even was heard throughout the whole vast palace. Outside, however,
the guards of honor on duty, and the patrol of musketeers, paced up and
down; and the sound of their feet could be heard on the gravel walks.
It seemed to act as an additional soporific for the sleepers, while the
murmuring of the wind through the trees, and the unceasing music of
the fountains whose waters tumbled in the basin, still went on
uninterruptedly, without being disturbed at the slight noises and items
of little moment that constitute the life and death of human nature.



Chapter XX. The Morning.

In vivid contrast to the sad and terrible destiny of the king imprisoned
in the Bastile, and tearing, in sheer despair, the bolts and bars of
his dungeon, the rhetoric of the chroniclers of old would not fail to
present, as a complete antithesis, the picture of Philippe lying asleep
beneath the royal canopy. We do not pretend to say that such rhetoric is
always bad, and always scatters, in places where they have no right to
grow, the flowers with which it embellishes and enlivens history. But we
shall, on the present occasion, carefully avoid polishing the antithesis
in question, but shall proceed to draw another picture as minutely as
possible, to serve as foil and counterfoil to the one in the preceding
chapter. The young prince alighted from Aramis’s room, in the same way
the king had descended from the apartment dedicated to Morpheus.
The dome gradually and slowly sank down under Aramis’s pressure, and
Philippe stood beside the royal bed, which had ascended again after
having deposited its prisoner in the secret depths of the subterranean
passage. Alone, in the presence of all the luxury which surrounded him;
alone, in the presence of his power; alone, with the part he was about
to be forced to act, Philippe for the first time felt his heart, and
mind, and soul expand beneath the influence of a thousand mutable
emotions, which are the vital throbs of a king’s heart. He could not
help changing color when he looked upon the empty bed, still tumbled
by his brother’s body. This mute accomplice had returned, after having
completed the work it had been destined to perform; it returned with the
traces of the crime; it spoke to the guilty author of that crime, with
the frank and unreserved language which an accomplice never fears to
use in the company of his companion in guilt; for it spoke the truth.
Philippe bent over the bed, and perceived a pocket-handkerchief lying on
it, which was still damp from the cold sweat which had poured from Louis
XIV.’s face. This sweat-bestained handkerchief terrified Philippe, as
the gore of Abel frightened Cain.

“I am face to face with my destiny,” said Philippe, his eyes on fire,
and his face a livid white. “Is it likely to be more terrifying than my
captivity has been sad and gloomy? Though I am compelled to follow out,
at every moment, the sovereign power and authority I have usurped, shall
I cease to listen to the scruples of my heart? Yes! the king has lain
on this bed; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this
pillow; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief: and yet,
I hesitate to throw myself on the bed, or to press in my hand the
handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother’s arms. Away with such
weakness; let me imitate M. d’Herblay, who asserts that a man’s action
should be always one degree above his thoughts; let me imitate M.
d’Herblay, whose thoughts are of and for himself alone, who regards
himself as a man of honor, so long as he injures or betrays his enemies
only. I, I alone, should have occupied this bed, if Louis XIV. had not,
owing to my mother’s criminal abandonment, stood in my way; and this
handkerchief, embroidered with the arms of France, would in right and
justice belong to me alone, if, as M. d’Herblay observes, I had been
left my royal cradle. Philippe, son of France, take your place on that
bed; Philippe, sole king of France, resume the blazonry that is yours!
Philippe, sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII., your father, show
yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who, at this moment, has
not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to
submit to.”

With these words, Philippe, notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of
feeling, and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will,
threw himself on the royal bed, and forced his muscles to press the
still warm place where Louis XIV. had lain, while he buried his burning
face in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother’s tears. With
his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow, Philippe
perceived above him the crown of France, suspended, as we have stated,
by angels with outspread golden wings.

A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion’s den, but can hardly hope to
sleep there quietly. Philippe listened attentively to every sound; his
heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror
and misfortune; but confident in his own strength, which was confirmed
by the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination, he waited
until some decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself.
He hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him, like those
phosphoric lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of
the waves against which they have to struggle. But nothing approached.
Silence, that mortal enemy of restless hearts, and of ambitious minds,
shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night
the future king of France, who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen
crown. Towards the morning a shadow, rather than a body, glided into the
royal chamber; Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor
exhibited any surprise.

“Well, M. d’Herblay?”

“Well, sire, all is accomplished.”

“How?”

“Exactly as we expected.”

“Did he resist?”

“Terribly! tears and entreaties.”

“And then?”

“A perfect stupor.”

“But at last?”

“Oh! at last, a complete victory, and absolute silence.”

“Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything?”

“Nothing.”

“The resemblance, however--”

“Was the cause of the success.”

“But the prisoner cannot fail to explain himself. Think well of that. I
have myself been able to do as much as that, on former occasion.”

“I have already provided for every chance. In a few days, sooner if
necessary, we will take the captive out of his prison, and will send him
out of the country, to a place of exile so remote--”

“People can return from their exile, Monsieur d’Herblay.”

“To a place of exile so distant, I was going to say, that human strength
and the duration of human life would not be enough for his return.”

Once more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the
young king.

“And M. du Vallon?” asked Philippe in order to change the conversation.

“He will be presented to you to-day, and confidentially will
congratulate you on the danger which that conspirator has made you run.”

“What is to be done with him?”

“With M. du Vallon?”

“Yes; confer a dukedom on him, I suppose.”

“A dukedom,” replied Aramis, smiling in a significant manner.

“Why do you laugh, Monsieur d’Herblay?”

“I laugh at the extreme caution of your idea.”

“Cautious, why so?”

“Your majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become
a troublesome witness, and you wish to get rid of him.”

“What! in making him a duke?”

“Certainly; you would assuredly kill him, for he would die from joy, and
the secret would die with him.”

“Good heavens!”

“Yes,” said Aramis, phlegmatically; “I should lose a very good friend.”

At this moment, and in the middle of this idle conversation, under the
light tone of which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride
at their mutual success, Aramis heard something which made him prick up
his ears.

“What is that?” said Philippe.

“The dawn, sire.”

“Well?”

“Well, before you retired to bed last night, you probably decided to do
something this morning at break of day.”

“Yes, I told my captain of the musketeers,” replied the young man
hurriedly, “that I should expect him.”

“If you told him that, he will certainly be here, for he is a most
punctual man.”

“I hear a step in the vestibule.”

“It must be he.”

“Come, let us begin the attack,” said the young king resolutely.

“Be cautious for Heaven’s sake. To begin the attack, and with
D’Artagnan, would be madness. D’Artagnan knows nothing, he has seen
nothing; he is a hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the
slightest degree, but if he comes into this room the first this morning,
he will be sure to detect something of what has taken place, and which
he would imagine it his business to occupy himself about. Before we
allow D’Artagnan to penetrate into this room, we must air the room
thoroughly, or introduce so many people into it, that the keenest scent
in the whole kingdom may be deceived by the traces of twenty different
persons.”

“But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?”
 observed the prince, impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an
antagonist.

“I will take care of that,” replied the bishop, “and in order to begin,
I am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man.”

“He, too, is striking a blow, for I hear him at the door,” added the
prince, hurriedly.

And, in fact, a knock at the door was heard at that moment. Aramis was
not mistaken; for it was indeed D’Artagnan who adopted that mode of
announcing himself.

We have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet,
but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep, and
as soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the
sumptuous cornices of the superintendent’s room, D’Artagnan rose from
his armchair, arranged his sword, brushed his coat and hat with his
sleeve, like a private soldier getting ready for inspection.

“Are you going out?” said Fouquet.

“Yes, monseigneur. And you?”

“I shall remain.”

“You pledge your word?”

“Certainly.”

“Very good. Besides, my only reason for going out is to try and get that
reply,--you know what I mean?”

“That sentence, you mean--”

“Stay, I have something of the old Roman in me. This morning, when I
got up, I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the
_aiguillettes_, and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off. That is
an infallible sign.”

“Of prosperity?”

“Yes, be sure of it; for every time that that confounded belt of mine
stuck fast to my back, it always signified a punishment from M. de
Treville, or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin. Every time my sword
hung fast to my shoulder-belt, it always predicted some disagreeable
commission or another for me to execute, and I have had showers of
them all my life through. Every time, too, my sword danced about in its
sheath, a duel, fortunate in its result, was sure to follow: whenever it
dangled about the calves of my legs, it signified a slight wound; every
time it fell completely out of the scabbard, I was booked, and made up
my mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle, with two or
three months under surgical bandages into the bargain.”

“I did not know your sword kept you so well informed,” said Fouquet,
with a faint smile, which showed how he was struggling against his
own weakness. “Is your sword bewitched, or under the influence of some
imperial charm?”

“Why, you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my
own body. I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them
by feeling something the matter with their legs, or a throbbing of their
temples. With me, it is my sword that warns me. Well, it told me of
nothing this morning. But, stay a moment--look here, it has just fallen
of its own accord into the last hole of the belt. Do you know what that
is a warning of?”

“No.”

“Well, that tells me of an arrest that will have to be made this very
day.”

“Well,” said the surintendant, more astonished than annoyed by this
frankness, “if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your
sword, I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest
me.”

“You! arrest _you!_”

“Of course. The warning--”

“Does not concern you, since you have been arrested ever since
yesterday. It is not you I shall have to arrest, be assured of that.
That is the reason why I am delighted, and also the reason why I said
that my day will be a happy one.”

And with these words, pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness
of manner, the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the
king. He was on the point of leaving the room, when Fouquet said to him,
“One last mark of kindness.”

“What is it, monseigneur?”

“M. d’Herblay; let me see Monsieur d’Herblay.”

“I am going to try and get him to come to you.”

D’Artagnan did not think himself so good a prophet. It was written that
the day would pass away and realize all the predictions that had been
made in the morning. He had accordingly knocked, as we have seen, at the
king’s door. The door opened. The captain thought that it was the king
who had just opened it himself; and this supposition was not altogether
inadmissible, considering the state of agitation in which he had left
Louis XIV. the previous evening; but instead of his royal master, whom
he was on the point of saluting with the greatest respect, he perceived
the long, calm features of Aramis. So extreme was his surprise that
he could hardly refrain from uttering a loud exclamation. “Aramis!” he
said.

“Good morning, dear D’Artagnan,” replied the prelate, coldly.

“You here!” stammered out the musketeer.

“His majesty desires you to report that he is still sleeping, after
having been greatly fatigued during the whole night.”

“Ah!” said D’Artagnan, who could not understand how the bishop of
Vannes, who had been so indifferent a favorite the previous evening, had
become in half a dozen hours the most magnificent mushroom of fortune
that had ever sprung up in a sovereign’s bedroom. In fact, to transmit
the orders of the king even to the mere threshold of that monarch’s
room, to serve as an intermediary of Louis XIV. so as to be able to
give a single order in his name at a couple paces from him, he must have
become more than Richelieu had ever been to Louis XIII. D’Artagnan’s
expressive eye, half-opened lips, his curling mustache, said as much
indeed in the plainest language to the chief favorite, who remained calm
and perfectly unmoved.

“Moreover,” continued the bishop, “you will be good enough, monsieur le
capitaine des mousquetaires, to allow those only to pass into the king’s
room this morning who have special permission. His majesty does not wish
to be disturbed just yet.”

“But,” objected D’Artagnan, almost on the point of refusing to obey this
order, and particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions
which the king’s silence had aroused--“but, monsieur l’eveque, his
majesty gave me a rendezvous for this morning.”

“Later, later,” said the king’s voice, from the bottom of the alcove; a
voice which made a cold shudder pass through the musketeer’s veins. He
bowed, amazed, confused, and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis
seemed to overwhelm him, as soon as these words had been pronounced.

“And then,” continued the bishop, “as an answer to what you were coming
to ask the king, my dear D’Artagnan, here is an order of his majesty,
which you will be good enough to attend to forthwith, for it concerns M.
Fouquet.”

D’Artagnan took the order which was held out to him. “To be set at
liberty!” he murmured. “Ah!” and he uttered a second “ah!” still more
full of intelligence than the former; for this order explained Aramis’s
presence with the king, and that Aramis, in order to have obtained
Fouquet’s pardon, must have made considerable progress in the royal
favor, and that this favor explained, in its tenor, the hardly
conceivable assurance with which M. d’Herblay issued the order in the
king’s name. For D’Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood
something of the matter in hand to order to understand the rest. He
bowed and withdrew a couple of paces, as though he were about to leave.

“I am going with you,” said the bishop.

“Where to?”

“To M. Fouquet; I wish to be a witness of his delight.”

“Ah! Aramis, how you puzzled me just now!” said D’Artagnan again.

“But you understand _now_, I suppose?”

“Of course I understand,” he said aloud; but added in a low tone to
himself, almost hissing the words between his teeth, “No, no, I do not
understand yet. But it is all the same, for here is the order for it.”
 And then he added, “I will lead the way, monseigneur,” and he conducted
Aramis to Fouquet’s apartments.



Chapter XXI. The King’s Friend.

Fouquet was waiting with anxiety; he had already sent away many of his
servants and friends, who, anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary
receptions, had called at his door to inquire after him. Preserving
the utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair
above his head, he only asked them, as he did every one, indeed, who
came to the door, where Aramis was. When he saw D’Artagnan return,
and when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him, he could hardly
restrain his delight; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness. The
mere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for
the unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest. The prelate was silent
and grave; D’Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of
events.

“Well, captain, so you have brought M. d’Herblay to me.”

“And something better still, monseigneur.”

“What is that?”

“Liberty.”

“I am free!”

“Yes; by the king’s order.”

Fouquet resumed his usual serenity, that he might interrogate Aramis
with a look.

“Oh! yes, you can thank M. l’eveque de Vannes,” pursued D’Artagnan, “for
it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the
king.”

“Oh!” said Fouquet, more humiliated at the service than grateful at its
success.

“But you,” continued D’Artagnan, addressing Aramis--“you, who have
become M. Fouquet’s protector and patron, can you not do something for
me?”

“Anything in the wide world you like, my friend,” replied the bishop, in
his calmest tones.

“One thing only, then, and I shall be perfectly satisfied. How on earth
did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never
spoken to him more than twice in your life?”

“From a friend such as you are,” said Aramis, “I cannot conceal
anything.”

“Ah! very good, tell me, then.”

“Very well. You think that I have seen the king only twice, whilst the
fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times; only we have kept it
very secret, that is all.” And without trying to remove the color which
at this revelation made D’Artagnan’s face flush scarlet, Aramis
turned towards M. Fouquet, who was as much surprised as the musketeer.
“Monseigneur,” he resumed, “the king desires me to inform you that he
is more than ever your friend, and that your beautiful _fete_, so
generously offered by you on his behalf, has touched him to the very
heart.”

And thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner,
that the latter, incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was
of so prodigious a character, remained incapable of uttering a single
syllable, and equally incapable of thought or movement. D’Artagnan
fancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to
each other, and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive
politeness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door, when
he feels his presence is an inconvenience for others; but his eager
curiosity, spurred on by so many mysteries, counseled him to remain.

Aramis thereupon turned towards him, and said, in a quiet tone, “You
will not forget, my friend, the king’s order respecting those whom
he intends to receive this morning on rising.” These words were clear
enough, and the musketeer understood them; he therefore bowed to
Fouquet, and then to Aramis,--to the latter with a slight admixture of
ironical respect,--and disappeared.

No sooner had he left, than Fouquet, whose impatience had hardly been
able to wait for that moment, darted towards the door to close it, and
then returning to the bishop, he said, “My dear D’Herblay, I think it
now high time you should explain all that has passed, for, in plain and
honest truth, I do not understand anything.”

“We will explain all that to you,” said Aramis, sitting down, and making
Fouquet sit down also. “Where shall I begin?”

“With this first of all. Why does the king set me at liberty?”

“You ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you
arrested.”

“Since my arrest, I have had time to think over it, and my idea is
that it arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy. My _fete_ put M.
Colbert out of temper, and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint
against me; Belle-Isle, for instance.”

“No; there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle.”

“What is it, then?”

“Do you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de
Mazarin contrived to steal from you?”

“Yes, of course!”

“Well, you are pronounced a public robber.”

“Good heavens!”

“Oh! that is not all. Do you also remember that letter you wrote to La
Valliere?”

“Alas! yes.”

“And that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner.”

“Why should he have pardoned me, then?”

“We have not yet arrived at that part of our argument. I wish you to be
quite convinced of the fact itself. Observe this well: the king knows
you to be guilty of an appropriation of public funds. Oh! of course _I_
know that you have done nothing of the kind; but, at all events, the
king has seen the receipts, and he can do no other than believe you are
incriminated.”

“I beg your pardon, I do not see--”

“You will see presently, though. The king, moreover, having read your
love-letter to La Valliere, and the offers you there made her, cannot
retain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young lady; you
will admit that, I suppose?”

“Certainly. Pray conclude.”

“In the fewest words. The king, we may henceforth assume, is your
powerful, implacable, and eternal enemy.”

“Agreed. But am I, then, so powerful, that he has not dared to sacrifice
me, notwithstanding his hatred, with all the means which my weakness, or
my misfortunes, may have given him as a hold upon me?”

“It is clear, beyond all doubt,” pursued Aramis, coldly, “that the king
has quarreled with you--irreconcilably.”

“But, since he has absolved me--”

“Do you believe it likely?” asked the bishop, with a searching look.

“Without believing in his sincerity, I believe it in the accomplished
fact.”

Aramis slightly shrugged his shoulders.

“But why, then, should Louis XIV. have commissioned you to tell me what
you have just stated?”

“The king charged me with no message for you.”

“With nothing!” said the superintendent, stupefied. “But, that order--”

“Oh! yes. You are quite right. There _is_ an order, certainly;” and
these words were pronounced by Aramis in so strange a tone, that Fouquet
could not resist starting.

“You are concealing something from me, I see. What is it?”

Aramis softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin, but said nothing.

“Does the king exile me?”

“Do not act as if you were playing at the game children play at when
they have to try and guess where a thing has been hidden, and are
informed, by a bell being rung, when they are approaching near to it, or
going away from it.”

“Speak, then.”

“Guess.”

“You alarm me.”

“Bah! that is because you have not guessed, then.”

“What did the king say to you? In the name of our friendship, do not
deceive me.”

“The king has not said one word to me.”

“You are killing me with impatience, D’Herblay. Am I still
superintendent?”

“As long as you like.”

“But what extraordinary empire have you so suddenly acquired over his
majesty’s mind?”

“Ah! that’s the point.”

“He does your bidding?”

“I believe so.”

“It is hardly credible.”

“So any one would say.”

“D’Herblay, by our alliance, by our friendship, by everything you hold
dearest in the world, speak openly, I implore you. By what means have
you succeeded in overcoming Louis XIV.’s prejudices, for he did not like
you, I am certain.”

“The king will like me _now_,” said Aramis, laying stress upon the last
word.

“You have something particular, then, between you?”

“Yes.”

“A secret, perhaps?”

“A secret.”

“A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty’s interests?”

“You are, indeed, a man of superior intelligence, monseigneur, and
have made a particularly accurate guess. I have, in fact, discovered a
secret, of a nature to change the interests of the king of France.”

“Ah!” said Fouquet, with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask
any more questions.

“And you shall judge of it yourself,” pursued Aramis; “and you shall
tell me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret.”

“I am listening, since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me;
only do not forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be
indiscreet in you to communicate.”

Aramis seemed, for a moment, as if he were collecting himself.

“Do not speak!” said Fouquet: “there is still time enough.”

“Do you remember,” said the bishop, casting down his eyes, “the birth of
Louis XIV.?”

“As if it were yesterday.”

“Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?”

“Nothing; except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII.”

“That does not matter to us, or the kingdom either; he is the son of his
father, says the French law, whose father is recognized by law.”

“True; but it is a grave matter, when the quality of races is called
into question.”

“A merely secondary question, after all. So that, in fact, you have
never learned or heard anything in particular?”

“Nothing.”

“That is where my secret begins. The queen, you must know, instead of
being delivered of a son, was delivered of twins.”

Fouquet looked up suddenly as he replied:

“And the second is dead?”

“You will see. These twins seemed likely to be regarded as the pride of
their mother, and the hope of France; but the weak nature of the king,
his superstitious feelings, made him apprehend a series of conflicts
between two children whose rights were equal; so he put out of the
way--he suppressed--one of the twins.”

“Suppressed, do you say?”

“Have patience. Both the children grew up; the one on the throne, whose
minister you are--the other, who is my friend, in gloom and isolation.”

“Good heavens! What are you saying, Monsieur d’Herblay? And what is this
poor prince doing?”

“Ask me, rather, what has he done.”

“Yes, yes.”

“He was brought up in the country, and then thrown into a fortress which
goes by the name of the Bastile.”

“Is it possible?” cried the surintendant, clasping his hands.

“The one was the most fortunate of men: the other the most unhappy and
miserable of all living beings.”

“Does his mother not know this?”

“Anne of Austria knows it all.”

“And the king?”

“Knows absolutely nothing.”

“So much the better,” said Fouquet.

This remark seemed to make a great impression on Aramis; he looked at
Fouquet with the most anxious expression of countenance.

“I beg your pardon; I interrupted you,” said Fouquet.

“I was saying,” resumed Aramis, “that this poor prince was the
unhappiest of human beings, when Heaven, whose thoughts are over all His
creatures, undertook to come to his assistance.”

“Oh! in what way? Tell me.”

“You will see. The reigning king--I say the reigning king--you can guess
very well why?”

“No. Why?”

“Because _both_ of them, being legitimate princes, ought to have been
kings. Is not that your opinion?”

“It is, certainly.”

“Unreservedly?”

“Most unreservedly; twins are one person in two bodies.”

“I am pleased that a legist of your learning and authority should
have pronounced such an opinion. It is agreed, then, that each of them
possessed equal rights, is it not?”

“Incontestably! but, gracious heavens, what an extraordinary
circumstance!”

“We are not at the end of it yet.--Patience.”

“Oh! I shall find ‘patience’ enough.”

“Heaven wished to raise up for that oppressed child an avenger, or
a supporter, or vindicator, if you prefer it. It happened that the
reigning king, the usurper--you are quite of my opinion, I believe, that
it is an act of usurpation quietly to enjoy, and selfishly to assume the
right over, an inheritance to which a man has only half a right?”

“Yes, usurpation is the word.”

“In that case, I continue. It was Heaven’s will that the usurper should
possess, in the person of his first minister, a man of great talent, of
large and generous nature.”

“Well, well,” said Fouquet, “I understand you; you have relied upon me
to repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis
XIV. You have thought well; I will help you. I thank you, D’Herblay, I
thank you.”

“Oh, no, it is not that at all; you have not allowed me to finish,” said
Aramis, perfectly unmoved.

“I will not say another word, then.”

“M. Fouquet, I was observing, the minister of the reigning sovereign,
was suddenly taken into the greatest aversion, and menaced with the
ruin of his fortune, loss of liberty, loss of life even, by intrigue and
personal hatred, to which the king gave too readily an attentive ear.
But Heaven permits (still, however, out of consideration for the unhappy
prince who had been sacrificed) that M. Fouquet should in his turn have
a devoted friend who knew this state secret, and felt that he possessed
strength and courage enough to divulge this secret, after having had the
strength to carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years.

“Go no farther,” said Fouquet, full of generous feelings. “I understand
you, and can guess everything now. You went to see the king when the
intelligence of my arrest reached you; you implored him, he refused to
listen to you; then you threatened him with that secret, threatened to
reveal it, and Louis XIV., alarmed at the risk of its betrayal, granted
to the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous
intercession. I understand, I understand; you have the king in your
power; I understand.”

“You understand _nothing_--as yet,” replied Aramis, “and again you
interrupt me. Then, too, allow me to observe that you pay no attention
to logical reasoning, and seem to forget what you ought most to
remember.”

“What do you mean?”

“You know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our
conversation?”

“Yes, his majesty’s hate, invincible hate for me; yes, but what feeling
of hate could resist the threat of such a revelation?”

“Such a revelation, do you say? that is the very point where your logic
fails you. What! do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to
the king, I should have been alive now?”

“It is not ten minutes ago that you were with the king.”

“That may be. He might not have had the time to get me killed outright,
but he would have had the time to get me gagged and thrown in a dungeon.
Come, come, show a little consistency in your reasoning, _mordieu!_”

And by the mere use of this word, which was so thoroughly his old
musketeer’s expression, forgotten by one who never seemed to forget
anything, Fouquet could not but understand to what a pitch of exaltation
the calm, impenetrable bishop of Vannes had wrought himself. He
shuddered.

“And then,” replied the latter, after having mastered his feelings,
“should I be the man I really am, should I be the true friend you
believe me, if I were to expose you, whom the king already hates so
bitterly, to a feeling more than ever to be dreaded in that young man?
To have robbed him, is nothing; to have addressed the woman he loves, is
not much; but to hold in your keeping both his crown and his honor, why,
he would pluck out your heart with his own hands.”

“You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?”

“I would sooner, far sooner, have swallowed at one draught all the
poisons that Mithridates drank in twenty years, in order to try and
avoid death, than have betrayed my secret to the king.”

“What have you done, then?”

“Ah! now we are coming to the point, monseigneur. I think I shall not
fail to excite in you a little interest. You are listening, I hope.”

“How can you ask me if I am listening? Go on.”

Aramis walked softly all round the room, satisfied himself that they
were alone, and that all was silent, and then returned and placed
himself close to the armchair in which Fouquet was seated, awaiting with
the deepest anxiety the revelation he had to make.

“I forgot to tell you,” resumed Aramis, addressing himself to Fouquet,
who listened to him with the most absorbed attention--“I forgot to
mention a most remarkable circumstance respecting these twins, namely,
that God had formed them so startlingly, so miraculously, like each
other, that it would be utterly impossible to distinguish the one from
the other. Their own mother would not be able to distinguish them.”

“Is it possible?” exclaimed Fouquet.

“The same noble character in their features, the same carriage, the same
stature, the same voice.”

“But their thoughts? degree of intelligence? their knowledge of human
life?”

“There is inequality there, I admit, monseigneur. Yes; for the prisoner
of the Bastile is, most incontestably, superior in every way to his
brother; and if, from his prison, this unhappy victim were to pass to
the throne, France would not, from the earliest period of its history,
perhaps, have had a master more powerful in genius and nobility of
character.”

Fouquet buried his face in his hands, as if he were overwhelmed by the
weight of this immense secret. Aramis approached him.

“There is a further inequality,” he said, continuing his work of
temptation, “an inequality which concerns yourself, monseigneur, between
the twins, both sons of Louis XIII., namely, the last comer does not
know M. Colbert.”

Fouquet raised his head immediately--his features were pale and
distorted. The bolt had hit its mark--not his heart, but his mind and
comprehension.

“I understand you,” he said to Aramis; “you are proposing a conspiracy
to me?”

“Something like it.”

“One of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this
conversation, alters the fate of empires?”

“And of superintendents, too; yes, monseigneur.”

“In a word, you propose that I should agree to the substitution of the
son of Louis XIII., who is now a prisoner in the Bastile, for the son of
Louis XIII., who is at this moment asleep in the Chamber of Morpheus?”

Aramis smiled with the sinister expression of the sinister thought which
was passing through his brain. “Exactly,” he said.

“Have you thought,” continued Fouquet, becoming animated with that
strength of talent which in a few seconds originates, and matures the
conception of a plan, and with that largeness of view which foresees all
consequences, and embraces every result at a glance--“have you thought
that we must assemble the nobility, the clergy, and the third estate
of the realm; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign, to
disturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father, to
sacrifice the life, the honor of a woman, Anne of Austria, the life and
peace of mind and heart of another woman, Maria Theresa; and suppose
that it were all done, if we were to succeed in doing it--”

“I do not understand you,” continued Aramis, coldly. “There is not a
single syllable of sense in all you have just said.”

“What!” said the superintendent, surprised, “a man like you refuse to
view the practical bearing of the case! Do you confine yourself to the
childish delight of a political illusion, and neglect the chances of its
being carried into execution; in other words, the reality itself, is it
possible?”

“My friend,” said Aramis, emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful
familiarity, “what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for
another?”

“Heaven!” exclaimed Fouquet--“Heaven gives directions to its agent,
who seizes upon the doomed victim, hurries him away, and seats the
triumphant rival on the empty throne. But you forget that this agent is
called death. Oh! Monsieur d’Herblay, in Heaven’s name, tell me if you
have had the idea--”

“There is no question of that, monseigneur; you are going beyond the
object in view. Who spoke of Louis XIV.’s death? who spoke of adopting
the example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution
of its decrees? No, I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its
purposes without confusion or disturbance, without exciting comment
or remark, without difficulty or exertion; and that men, inspired by
Heaven, succeed like Heaven itself, in all their undertakings, in all
they attempt, in all they do.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean, my _friend_,” returned Aramis, with the same intonation on the
word friend that he had applied to it the first time--“I mean that
if there has been any confusion, scandal, and even effort in the
substitution of the prisoner for the king, I defy you to prove it.”

“What!” cried Fouquet, whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped
his temples, “what do you say?”

“Go to the king’s apartment,” continued Aramis, tranquilly, “and you who
know the mystery, I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the
Bastile is lying in his brother’s bed.”

“But the king,” stammered Fouquet, seized with horror at the
intelligence.

“What king?” said Aramis, in his gentlest tone; “the one who hates you,
or the one who likes you?”

“The king--of--_yesterday_.”

“The king of yesterday! be quite easy on that score; he has gone to take
the place in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years.”

“Great God! And who took him there?”

“I.”

“You?”

“Yes, and in the simplest way. I carried him away last night. While he
was descending into midnight, the other was ascending into day. I do
not think there has been any disturbance whatever. A flash of lightning
without thunder awakens nobody.”

Fouquet uttered a thick, smothered cry, as if he had been struck by some
invisible blow, and clasping his head between his clenched hands, he
murmured: “You did that?”

“Cleverly enough, too; what do you think of it?”

“You dethroned the king? imprisoned him, too?”

“Yes, that has been done.”

“And such an action was committed _here_, at Vaux?”

“Yes, here, at Vaux, in the Chamber of Morpheus. It would almost seem
that it had been built in anticipation of such an act.”

“And at what time did it occur?”

“Last night, between twelve and one o’clock.”

Fouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon
Aramis; he restrained himself. “At Vaux; under my roof!” he said, in a
half-strangled voice.

“I believe so! for it is still your house, and it is likely to continue
so, since M. Colbert cannot rob you of it now.”

“It was under my roof, then, monsieur, that you committed this crime?”

“This crime?” said Aramis, stupefied.

“This abominable crime!” pursued Fouquet, becoming more and more
excited; “this crime more execrable than an assassination! this crime
which dishonors my name forever, and entails upon me the horror of
posterity.”

“You are not in your senses, monsieur,” replied Aramis, in an irresolute
tone of voice; “you are speaking too loudly; take care!”

“I will call out so loudly, that the whole world shall hear me.”

“Monsieur Fouquet, take care!”

Fouquet turned round towards the prelate, whom he looked at full in the
face. “You have dishonored me,” he said, “in committing so foul an
act of treason, so heinous a crime upon my guest, upon one who was
peacefully reposing beneath my roof. Oh! woe, woe is me!”

“Woe to the man, rather, who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of
your fortune, your life. Do you forget that?”

“He was my guest, my sovereign.”

Aramis rose, his eyes literally bloodshot, his mouth trembling
convulsively. “Have I a man out of his senses to deal with?” he said.

“You have an honorable man to deal with.”

“You are mad.”

“A man who will prevent you consummating your crime.”

“You are mad, I say.”

“A man who would sooner, oh! far sooner, die; who would kill you even,
rather than allow you to complete his dishonor.”

And Fouquet snatched up his sword, which D’Artagnan had placed at the
head of his bed, and clenched it resolutely in his hand. Aramis frowned,
and thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon. This
movement did not escape Fouquet, who, full of nobleness and pride in
his magnanimity, threw his sword to a distance from him, and approached
Aramis so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand.
“Monsieur,” he said, “I would sooner die here on the spot than survive
this terrible disgrace; and if you have any pity left for me, I entreat
you to take my life.”

Aramis remained silent and motionless.

“You do not reply?” said Fouquet.

Aramis raised his head gently, and a glimmer of hope might be seen
once more to animate his eyes. “Reflect, monseigneur,” he said, “upon
everything we have to expect. As the matter now stands, the king is
still alive, and his imprisonment saves your life.”

“Yes,” replied Fouquet, “you may have been acting on my behalf, but I
will not, do not, accept your services. But, first of all, I do not wish
your ruin. You will leave this house.”

Aramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart.

“I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof,”
 continued Fouquet, with an air of inexpressible majesty; “you will not
be more fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated.”

“You will be so,” said Aramis, in a hoarse, prophetic voice, “you will
be so, believe me.”

“I accept the augury, Monsieur d’Herblay; but nothing shall prevent me,
nothing shall stop me. You will leave Vaux--you must leave France; I
give you four hours to place yourself out of the king’s reach.”

“Four hours?” said Aramis, scornfully and incredulously.

“Upon the word of Fouquet, no one shall follow you before the expiration
of that time. You will therefore have four hours’ advance of those whom
the king may wish to dispatch after you.”

“Four hours!” repeated Aramis, in a thick, smothered voice.

“It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to
Belle-Isle, which I give you as a place of refuge.”

“Ah!” murmured Aramis.

“Belle-Isle is as much mine for you, as Vaux is mine for the king.
Go, D’Herblay, go! as long as I live, not a hair of your head shall be
injured.”

“Thank you,” said Aramis, with a cold irony of manner.

“Go at once, then, and give me your hand, before we both hasten away;
you to save your life, I to save my honor.”

Aramis withdrew from his breast the hand he had concealed there; it was
stained with his blood. He had dug his nails into his flesh, as if in
punishment for having nursed so many projects, more vain, insensate, and
fleeting than the life of the man himself. Fouquet was horror-stricken,
and then his heart smote him with pity. He threw open his arms as if to
embrace him.

“I had no arms,” murmured Aramis, as wild and terrible in his wrath as
the shade of Dido. And then, without touching Fouquet’s hand, he turned
his head aside, and stepped back a pace or two. His last word was an
imprecation, his last gesture a curse, which his blood-stained hand
seemed to invoke, as it sprinkled on Fouquet’s face a few drops of blood
which flowed from his breast. And both of them darted out of the room
by the secret staircase which led down to the inner courtyard. Fouquet
ordered his best horses, while Aramis paused at the foot of the
staircase which led to Porthos’s apartment. He reflected profoundly
and for some time, while Fouquet’s carriage left the courtyard at full
gallop.

“Shall I go alone?” said Aramis to himself, “or warn the prince? Oh!
fury! Warn the prince, and then--do what? Take him with me? To carry
this accusing witness about with me everywhere? War, too, would
follow--civil war, implacable in its nature! And without any resource
save myself--it is impossible! What could he do without me? Oh!
without me he will be utterly destroyed. Yet who knows--let destiny
be fulfilled--condemned he was, let him remain so then! Good or evil
Spirit--gloomy and scornful Power, whom men call the genius of humanity,
thou art a power more restlessly uncertain, more baselessly useless,
than wild mountain wind! Chance, thou term’st thyself, but thou art
nothing; thou inflamest everything with thy breath, crumblest mountains
at thy approach, and suddenly art thyself destroyed at the presence of
the Cross of dead wood behind which stand another Power invisible like
thyself--whom thou deniest, perhaps, but whose avenging hand is on thee,
and hurls thee in the dust dishonored and unnamed! Lost!--I am lost!
What can be done? Flee to Belle-Isle? Yes, and leave Porthos behind me,
to talk and relate the whole affair to every one! Porthos, too, who will
have to suffer for what he has done. I will not let poor Porthos suffer.
He seems like one of the members of my own frame; and his grief or
misfortune would be mine as well. Porthos shall leave with me, and shall
follow my destiny. It must be so.”

And Aramis, apprehensive of meeting any one to whom his hurried
movements might appear suspicious, ascended the staircase without being
perceived. Porthos, so recently returned from Paris, was already in a
profound sleep; his huge body forgot its fatigue, as his mind forgot
its thoughts. Aramis entered, light as a shadow, and placed his nervous
grasp on the giant’s shoulder. “Come, Porthos,” he cried, “come.”

Porthos obeyed, rose from his bed, opened his eyes, even before his
intelligence seemed to be aroused.

“We leave immediately,” said Aramis.

“Ah!” returned Porthos.

“We shall go mounted, and faster than we have ever gone in our lives.”

“Ah!” repeated Porthos.

“Dress yourself, my friend.”

And he helped the giant to dress himself, and thrust his gold and
diamonds into his pocket. Whilst he was thus engaged, a slight noise
attracted his attention, and on looking up, he saw D’Artagnan watching
them through the half-opened door. Aramis started.

“What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?” said
the musketeer.

“Hush!” said Porthos.

“We are going off on a mission of great importance,” added the bishop.

“You are very fortunate,” said the musketeer.

“Oh, dear me!” said Porthos, “I feel so wearied; I would far sooner have
been fast asleep. But the service of the king....”

“Have you seen M. Fouquet?” said Aramis to D’Artagnan.

“Yes, this very minute, in a carriage.”

“What did he say to you?”

“‘Adieu;’ nothing more.”

“Was that all?”

“What else do you think he could say? Am I worth anything now, since you
have got into such high favor?”

“Listen,” said Aramis, embracing the musketeer; “your good times are
returning again. You will have no occasion to be jealous of any one.”

“Ah! bah!”

“I predict that something will happen to you to-day which will increase
your importance more than ever.”

“Really?”

“You know that I know all the news?”

“Oh, yes!”

“Come, Porthos, are you ready? Let us go.”

“I am quite ready, Aramis.”

“Let us embrace D’Artagnan first.”

“Most certainly.”

“But the horses?”

“Oh! there is no want of them here. Will you have mine?”

“No; Porthos has his own stud. So adieu! adieu!”

The fugitives mounted their horses beneath the very eyes of the captain
of the musketeers, who held Porthos’s stirrup for him, and gazed after
them until they were out of sight.

“On any other occasion,” thought the Gascon, “I should say that those
gentlemen were making their escape; but in these days politics seem
so changed that such an exit is termed going on a mission. I have no
objection; let me attend to my own affairs, that is more than enough for
_me_,”--and he philosophically entered his apartments.



Chapter XXII. Showing How the Countersign Was Respected at the Bastile.

Fouquet tore along as fast as his horses could drag him. On his way he
trembled with horror at the idea of what had just been revealed to him.

“What must have been,” he thought, “the youth of those extraordinary
men, who, even as age is stealing fast upon them, are still able to
conceive such gigantic plans, and carry them through without a tremor?”

At one moment he could not resist the idea that all Aramis had just been
recounting to him was nothing more than a dream, and whether the fable
itself was not the snare; so that when Fouquet arrived at the Bastile,
he might possibly find an order of arrest, which would send him to join
the dethroned king. Strongly impressed with this idea, he gave certain
sealed orders on his route, while fresh horses were being harnessed
to his carriage. These orders were addressed to M. d’Artagnan and to
certain others whose fidelity to the king was far above suspicion.

“In this way,” said Fouquet to himself, “prisoner or not, I shall have
performed the duty that I owe my honor. The orders will not reach them
until after my return, if I should return free, and consequently they
will not have been unsealed. I shall take them back again. If I am
delayed; it will be because some misfortune will have befallen me; and
in that case assistance will be sent for me as well as for the king.”

Prepared in this manner, the superintendent arrived at the Bastile;
he had traveled at the rate of five leagues and a half the hour. Every
circumstance of delay which Aramis had escaped in his visit to the
Bastile befell Fouquet. It was useless giving his name, equally useless
his being recognized; he could not succeed in obtaining an entrance.
By dint of entreaties, threats, commands, he succeeded in inducing a
sentinel to speak to one of the subalterns, who went and told the major.
As for the governor they did not even dare disturb him. Fouquet sat in
his carriage, at the outer gate of the fortress, chafing with rage and
impatience, awaiting the return of the officers, who at last re-appeared
with a sufficiently sulky air.

“Well,” said Fouquet, impatiently, “what did the major say?”

“Well, monsieur,” replied the soldier, “the major laughed in my face. He
told me that M. Fouquet was at Vaux, and that even were he at Paris, M.
Fouquet would not get up at so early an hour as the present.”

“_Mordieu!_ you are an absolute set of fools,” cried the minister,
darting out of the carriage; and before the subaltern had time to shut
the gate, Fouquet sprang through it, and ran forward in spite of the
soldier, who cried out for assistance. Fouquet gained ground, regardless
of the cries of the man, who, however, having at last come up with
Fouquet, called out to the sentinel of the second gate, “Look out, look
out, sentinel!” The man crossed his pike before the minister; but
the latter, robust and active, and hurried away, too, by his passion,
wrested the pike from the soldier and struck him a violent blow on the
shoulder with it. The subaltern, who approached too closely, received a
share of the blows as well. Both of them uttered loud and furious cries,
at the sound of which the whole of the first body of the advanced guard
poured out of the guardhouse. Among them there was one, however,
who recognized the superintendent, and who called, “Monseigneur, ah!
monseigneur. Stop, stop, you fellows!” And he effectually checked the
soldiers, who were on the point of revenging their companions. Fouquet
desired them to open the gate, but they refused to do so without the
countersign; he desired them to inform the governor of his presence;
but the latter had already heard the disturbance at the gate. He ran
forward, followed by his major, and accompanied by a picket of twenty
men, persuaded that an attack was being made on the Bastile. Baisemeaux
also recognized Fouquet immediately, and dropped the sword he bravely
had been brandishing.

“Ah! monseigneur,” he stammered, “how can I excuse--”

“Monsieur,” said the superintendent, flushed with anger, and heated by
his exertions, “I congratulate you. Your watch and ward are admirably
kept.”

Baisemeaux turned pale, thinking that this remark was made ironically,
and portended a furious burst of anger. But Fouquet had recovered his
breath, and, beckoning the sentinel and the subaltern, who were rubbing
their shoulders, towards him, he said, “There are twenty pistoles for
the sentinel, and fifty for the officer. Pray receive my compliments,
gentlemen. I will not fail to speak to his majesty about you. And now,
M. Baisemeaux, a word with you.”

And he followed the governor to his official residence, accompanied by
a murmur of general satisfaction. Baisemeaux was already trembling with
shame and uneasiness. Aramis’s early visit, from that moment, seemed to
possess consequences, which a functionary such as he (Baisemeaux) was,
was perfectly justified in apprehending. It was quite another thing,
however, when Fouquet in a sharp tone of voice, and with an imperious
look, said, “You have seen M. d’Herblay this morning?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“And are you not horrified at the crime of which you have made yourself
an accomplice?”

“Well,” thought Baisemeaux, “good so far;” and then he added, aloud,
“But what crime, monseigneur, do you allude to?”

“That for which you can be quartered alive, monsieur--do not forget
that! But this is not a time to show anger. Conduct me immediately to
the prisoner.”

“To what prisoner?” said Baisemeaux, trembling.

“You pretend to be ignorant? Very good--it is the best plan for you,
perhaps; for if, in fact, you were to admit your participation in such
a crime, it would be all over with you. I wish, therefore, to seem to
believe in your assumption of ignorance.”

“I entreat you, monseigneur--”

“That will do. Lead me to the prisoner.”

“To Marchiali?”

“Who is Marchiali?”

“The prisoner who was brought back this morning by M. d’Herblay.”

“He is called Marchiali?” said the superintendent, his conviction
somewhat shaken by Baisemeaux’s cool manner.

“Yes, monseigneur; that is the name under which he was inscribed here.”

Fouquet looked steadily at Baisemeaux, as if he would read his very
heart; and perceived, with that clear-sightedness most men possess who
are accustomed to the exercise of power, that the man was speaking with
perfect sincerity. Besides, in observing his face for a few moments, he
could not believe that Aramis would have chosen such a confidant.

“It is the prisoner,” said the superintendent to him, “whom M. d’Herblay
carried away the day before yesterday?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“And whom he brought back this morning?” added Fouquet, quickly: for he
understood immediately the mechanism of Aramis’s plan.

“Precisely, monseigneur.”

“And his name is Marchiali, you say?”

“Yes, Marchiali. If monseigneur has come here to remove him, so much the
better, for I was going to write about him.”

“What has he done, then?”

“Ever since this morning he has annoyed me extremely. He has had such
terrible fits of passion, as almost to make me believe that he would
bring the Bastile itself down about our ears.”

“I will soon relieve you of his possession,” said Fouquet.

“Ah! so much the better.”

“Conduct me to his prison.”

“Will monseigneur give me the order?”

“What order?”

“An order from the king.”

“Wait until I sign you one.”

“That will not be sufficient, monseigneur. I must have an order from the
king.”

Fouquet assumed an irritated expression. “As you are so scrupulous,” he
said, “with regard to allowing prisoners to leave, show me the order by
which this one was set at liberty.”

Baisemeaux showed him the order to release Seldon.

“Very good,” said Fouquet; “but Seldon is not Marchiali.”

“But Marchiali is not at liberty, monseigneur; he is here.”

“But you said that M. d’Herblay carried him away and brought him back
again.”

“I did not say so.”

“So surely did you say it, that I almost seem to hear it now.”

“It was a slip of my tongue, then, monseigneur.”

“Take care, M. Baisemeaux, take care.”

“I have nothing to fear, monseigneur; I am acting according to the very
strictest regulation.”

“Do you dare to say so?”

“I would say so in the presence of one of the apostles. M. d’Herblay
brought me an order to set Seldon at liberty. Seldon is free.”

“I tell you that Marchiali has left the Bastile.”

“You must prove that, monseigneur.”

“Let me see him.”

“You, monseigneur, who govern this kingdom, know very well that no one
can see any of the prisoners without an express order from the king.”

“M. d’Herblay has entered, however.”

“That remains to be proved, monseigneur.”

“M. de Baisemeaux, once more I warn you to pay particular attention to
what you are saying.”

“All the documents are there, monseigneur.”

“M. d’Herblay is overthrown.”

“Overthrown?--M. d’Herblay! Impossible!”

“You see that he has undoubtedly influenced you.”

“No, monseigneur; what does, in fact, influence me, is the king’s
service. I am doing my duty. Give me an order from him, and you shall
enter.”

“Stay, M. le gouverneur, I give you my word that if you allow me to see
the prisoner, I will give you an order from the king at once.”

“Give it to me now, monseigneur.”

“And that, if you refuse me, I will have you and all your officers
arrested on the spot.”

“Before you commit such an act of violence, monseigneur, you will
reflect,” said Baisemeaux, who had turned very pale, “that we will only
obey an order signed by the king; and that it will be just as easy for
you to obtain one to see Marchiali as to obtain one to do me so much
injury; me, too, who am perfectly innocent.”

“True. True!” cried Fouquet, furiously; “perfectly true. M. de
Baisemeaux,” he added, in a sonorous voice, drawing the unhappy governor
towards him, “do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the prisoner?”

“No, monseigneur; and allow me to observe that you are terrifying me out
of my senses; I am trembling all over--in fact, I feel as though I were
about to faint.”

“You will stand a better chance of fainting outright, Monsieur
Baisemeaux, when I return here at the head of ten thousand men and
thirty pieces of cannon.”

“Good heavens, monseigneur, you are losing your senses.”

“When I have roused the whole population of Paris against you and your
accursed towers, and have battered open the gates of this place, and
hanged you to the topmost tree of yonder pinnacle!”

“Monseigneur! monseigneur! for pity’s sake!”

“I give you ten minutes to make up your mind,” added Fouquet, in a calm
voice. “I will sit down here, in this armchair, and wait for you; if,
in ten minutes’ time, you still persist, I leave this place, and you may
think me as mad as you like. Then--you shall _see!_”

Baisemeaux stamped his foot on the ground like a man in a state of
despair, but he did not reply a single syllable; whereupon Fouquet
seized a pen and ink, and wrote:

“Order for M. le Prevot des Marchands to assemble the municipal guard
and to march upon the Bastile on the king’s immediate service.”

Baisemeaux shrugged his shoulders. Fouquet wrote:

“Order for the Duc de Bouillon and M. le Prince de Conde to assume the
command of the Swiss guards, of the king’s guards, and to march upon the
Bastile on the king’s immediate service.”

Baisemeaux reflected. Fouquet still wrote:

“Order for every soldier, citizen, or gentleman to seize and apprehend,
wherever he may be found, le Chevalier d’Herblay, Eveque de Vannes,
and his accomplices, who are: first, M. de Baisemeaux, governor of the
Bastile, suspected of the crimes of high treason and rebellion--”

“Stop, monseigneur!” cried Baisemeaux; “I do not understand a single
jot of the whole matter; but so many misfortunes, even were it madness
itself that had set them at their awful work, might happen here in
a couple of hours, that the king, by whom I must be judged, will see
whether I have been wrong in withdrawing the countersign before this
flood of imminent catastrophes. Come with me to the keep, monseigneur,
you shall see Marchiali.”

Fouquet darted out of the room, followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the
perspiration from his face. “What a terrible morning!” he said; “what a
disgrace for _me!_”

“Walk faster,” replied Fouquet.

Baisemeaux made a sign to the jailer to precede them. He was afraid of
his companion, which the latter could not fail to perceive.

“A truce to this child’s play,” he said, roughly. “Let the man remain
here; take the keys yourself, and show me the way. Not a single person,
do you understand, must hear what is going to take place here.”

“Ah!” said Baisemeaux, undecided.

“Again!” cried M. Fouquet. “Ah! say ‘no’ at once, and I will leave the
Bastile and will myself carry my own dispatches.”

Baisemeaux bowed his head, took the keys, and unaccompanied, except by
the minister, ascended the staircase. The higher they advanced up the
spiral staircase, the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become
distinct appeals and fearful imprecations.

“What is that?” asked Fouquet.

“That is your Marchiali,” said the governor; “this is the way these
madmen scream.”

And he accompanied that reply with a glance more pregnant with injurious
allusion, as far as Fouquet was concerned, than politeness. The latter
trembled; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that
had preceded it, the king’s voice. He paused on the staircase, snatching
the bunch of keys from Baisemeaux, who thought this new madman was going
to dash out his brains with one of them. “Ah!” he cried, “M. d’Herblay
did not say a word about that.”

“Give me the keys at once!” cried Fouquet, tearing them from his hand.
“Which is the key of the door I am to open?”

“That one.”

A fearful cry, followed by a violent blow against the door, made the
whole staircase resound with the echo.

“Leave this place,” said Fouquet to Baisemeaux, in a threatening tone.

“I ask nothing better,” murmured the latter, to himself. “There will be
a couple of madmen face to face, and the one will kill the other, I am
sure.”

“Go!” repeated Fouquet. “If you place your foot on this staircase
before I call you, remember that you shall take the place of the meanest
prisoner in the Bastile.”

“This job will kill me, I am sure it will,” muttered Baisemeaux, as he
withdrew with tottering steps.

The prisoner’s cries became more and more terrible. When Fouquet
had satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the
staircase, he inserted the key in the first lock. It was then that he
heard the hoarse, choking voice of the king, crying out, in a frenzy of
rage, “Help, help! I am the king.” The key of the second door was not
the same as the first, and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the
bunch. The king, however, furious and almost mad with rage and passion,
shouted at the top of his voice, “It was M. Fouquet who brought me here.
Help me against M. Fouquet! I am the king! Help the king against
M. Fouquet!” These cries filled the minister’s heart with terrible
emotions. They were followed by a shower of blows leveled against the
door with a part of the broken chair with which the king had armed
himself. Fouquet at last succeeded in finding the key. The king was
almost exhausted; he could hardly articulate distinctly as he shouted,
“Death to Fouquet! death to the traitor Fouquet!” The door flew open.



Chapter XXIII. The King’s Gratitude.

The two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they
suddenly and abruptly stopped, as a mutual recognition took place, and
each uttered a cry of horror.

“Have you come to assassinate me, monsieur?” said the king, when he
recognized Fouquet.

“The king in this state!” murmured the minister.

Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young
prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him; his clothes were in
tatters; his shirt, open and torn to rags, was stained with sweat
and with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms.
Haggard, ghastly pale, his hair in disheveled masses, Louis XIV.
presented the most perfect picture of despair, distress, anger and fear
combined that could possibly be united in one figure. Fouquet was so
touched, so affected and disturbed by it, that he ran towards him with
his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears. Louis held up the
massive piece of wood of which he had made such a furious use.

“Sire,” said Fouquet, in a voice trembling with emotion, “do you not
recognize the most faithful of your friends?”

“A friend--you!” repeated Louis, gnashing his teeth in a manner which
betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance.

“The most respectful of your servants,” added Fouquet, throwing himself
on his knees. The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp.
Fouquet approached him, kissed his knees, and took him in his arms with
inconceivable tenderness.

“My king, my child,” he said, “how you must have suffered!”

Louis, recalled to himself by the change of situation, looked at
himself, and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel, ashamed
of his conduct, and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was
shown towards him, drew back. Fouquet did not understand this movement;
he did not perceive that the king’s feeling of pride would never forgive
him for having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness.

“Come, sire,” he said, “you are free.”

“Free?” repeated the king. “Oh! you set me at liberty, then, after
having dared to lift up your hand against me.”

“You do not believe that!” exclaimed Fouquet, indignantly; “you cannot
believe me to be guilty of such an act.”

And rapidly, warmly even, he related the whole particulars of the
intrigue, the details of which are already known to the reader. While
the recital continued, Louis suffered the most horrible anguish of mind;
and when it was finished, the magnitude of the danger he had run struck
him far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin
brother.

“Monsieur,” he said, suddenly to Fouquet, “this double birth is a
falsehood; it is impossible--you cannot have been the dupe of it.”

“Sire!”

“It is impossible, I tell you, that the honor, the virtue of my mother
can be suspected, and my first minister has not yet done justice on the
criminals!”

“Reflect, sire, before you are hurried away by anger,” replied Fouquet.
“The birth of your brother--”

“I have only one brother--and that is Monsieur. You know it as well as
myself. There is a plot, I tell you, beginning with the governor of the
Bastile.”

“Be careful, sire, for this man has been deceived as every one else has
by the prince’s likeness to yourself.”

“Likeness? Absurd!”

“This Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty, to be able to
deceive every one’s eye,” Fouquet persisted.

“Ridiculous!”

“Do not say so, sire; those who had prepared everything in order to face
and deceive your ministers, your mother, your officers of state, the
members of your family, must be quite confident of the resemblance
between you.”

“But where are these persons, then?” murmured the king.

“At Vaux.”

“At Vaux! and you suffer them to remain there!”

“My most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty’s release. I
have accomplished that duty; and now, whatever your majesty may command,
shall be done. I await your orders.”

Louis reflected for a few moments.

“Muster all the troops in Paris,” he said.

“All the necessary orders are given for that purpose,” replied Fouquet.

“You have given orders!” exclaimed the king.

“For that purpose, yes, sire; your majesty will be at the head of ten
thousand men in less than an hour.”

The only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet’s hand with
such an expression of feeling, that it was very easy to perceive how
strongly he had, until that remark, maintained his suspicions of the
minister, notwithstanding the latter’s intervention.

“And with these troops,” he said, “we shall go at once and besiege
in your house the rebels who by this time will have established and
intrenched themselves therein.”

“I should be surprised if that were the case,” replied Fouquet.

“Why?”

“Because their chief--the very soul of the enterprise--having been
unmasked by me, the whole plan seems to me to have miscarried.”

“You have unmasked this false prince also?”

“No, I have not seen him.”

“Whom have you seen, then?”

“The leader of the enterprise, not that unhappy young man; the latter is
merely an instrument, destined through his whole life to wretchedness, I
plainly perceive.”

“Most certainly.”

“It is M. l’Abbe d’Herblay, Eveque de Vannes.”

“Your friend?”

“He was my friend, sire,” replied Fouquet, nobly.

“An unfortunate circumstance for you,” said the king, in a less generous
tone of voice.

“Such friendships, sire, had nothing dishonorable in them so long as I
was ignorant of the crime.”

“You should have foreseen it.”

“If I am guilty, I place myself in your majesty’s hands.”

“Ah! Monsieur Fouquet, it was not that I meant,” returned the king,
sorry to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner.
“Well! I assure you that, notwithstanding the mask with which the
villain covered his face, I had something like a vague suspicion that he
was the very man. But with this chief of the enterprise there was a
man of prodigious strength, the one who menaced me with a force almost
herculean; what is he?”

“It must be his friend the Baron du Vallon, formerly one of the
musketeers.”

“The friend of D’Artagnan? the friend of the Comte de la Fere? Ah!”
 exclaimed the king, as he paused at the name of the latter, “we must not
forget the connection that existed between the conspirators and M. de
Bragelonne.”

“Sire, sire, do not go too far. M. de la Fere is the most honorable man
in France. Be satisfied with those whom I deliver up to you.”

“With those whom you deliver up to me, you say? Very good, for you will
deliver up those who are guilty to me.”

“What does your majesty understand by that?” inquired Fouquet.

“I understand,” replied the king, “that we shall soon arrive at Vaux
with a large body of troops, that we will lay violent hands upon that
nest of vipers, and that not a soul shall escape.”

“Your majesty will put these men to death!” cried Fouquet.

“To the very meanest of them.”

“Oh! sire.”

“Let us understand one another, Monsieur Fouquet,” said the king,
haughtily. “We no longer live in times when assassination was the only
and the last resource kings held in reservation at extremity. No, Heaven
be praised! I have parliaments who sit and judge in my name, and I have
scaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out.”

Fouquet turned pale. “I will take the liberty of observing to your
majesty, that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would
bring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne. The
august name of Anne of Austria must never be allowed to pass the lips of
the people accompanied by a smile.”

“Justice must be done, however, monsieur.”

“Good, sire; but royal blood must not be shed upon a scaffold.”

“The royal blood! you believe that!” cried the king with fury in
his voice, stamping his foot on the ground. “This double birth is an
invention; and in that invention, particularly, do I see M. d’Herblay’s
crime. It is the crime I wish to punish rather than the violence, or the
insult.”

“And punish it with death, sire?”

“With death; yes, monsieur, I have said it.”

“Sire,” said the surintendant, with firmness, as he raised his head
proudly, “your majesty will take the life, if you please, of your
brother Philippe of France; that concerns you alone, and you will
doubtless consult the queen-mother upon the subject. Whatever she may
command will be perfectly correct. I do not wish to mix myself up in it,
not even for the honor of your crown, but I have a favor to ask of you,
and I beg to submit it to you.”

“Speak,” said the king, in no little degree agitated by his minister’s
last words. “What do you require?”

“The pardon of M. d’Herblay and of M. du Vallon.”

“My assassins?”

“Two rebels, sire, that is all.”

“Oh! I understand, then, you ask me to forgive your friends.”

“My friends!” said Fouquet, deeply wounded.

“Your friends, certainly; but the safety of the state requires that an
exemplary punishment should be inflicted on the guilty.”

“I will not permit myself to remind your majesty that I have just
restored you to liberty, and have saved your life.”

“Monsieur!”

“I will not allow myself to remind your majesty that had M. d’Herblay
wished to carry out his character of an assassin, he could very easily
have assassinated your majesty this morning in the forest of Senart, and
all would have been over.” The king started.

“A pistol-bullet through the head,” pursued Fouquet, “and the disfigured
features of Louis XIV., which no one could have recognized, would be M.
d’Herblay’s complete and entire justification.”

The king turned pale and giddy at the bare idea of the danger he had
escaped.

“If M. d’Herblay,” continued Fouquet, “had been an assassin, he had no
occasion to inform me of his plan in order to succeed. Freed from the
real king, it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the
false. And if the usurper had been recognized by Anne of Austria,
he would still have been--her son. The usurper, as far as Monsieur
d’Herblay’s conscience was concerned, was still a king of the blood of
Louis XIII. Moreover, the conspirator, in that course, would have had
security, secrecy, impunity. A pistol-bullet would have procured him all
that. For the sake of Heaven, sire, grant me his forgiveness.”

The king, instead of being touched by the picture, so faithfully drawn
in all details, of Aramis’s generosity, felt himself most painfully and
cruelly humiliated. His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a
man had held suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal
life. Every word that fell from Fouquet’s lips, and which he thought
most efficacious in procuring his friend’s pardon, seemed to pour
another drop of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis XIV.
Nothing could bend or soften him. Addressing himself to Fouquet, he
said, “I really don’t know, monsieur, why you should solicit the pardon
of these men. What good is there in asking that which can be obtained
without solicitation?”

“I do not understand you, sire.”

“It is not difficult, either. Where am I now?”

“In the Bastile, sire.”

“Yes; in a dungeon. I am looked upon as a madman, am I not?”

“Yes, sire.”

“And no one is known here but Marchiali?”

“Certainly.”

“Well; change nothing in the position of affairs. Let the poor madman
rot between the slimy walls of the Bastile, and M. d’Herblay and M.
du Vallon will stand in no need of my forgiveness. Their new king will
absolve them.”

“Your majesty does me a great injustice, sire; and you are wrong,”
 replied Fouquet, dryly; “I am not child enough, nor is M. d’Herblay
silly enough, to have omitted to make all these reflections; and if I
had wished to make a new king, as you say, I had no occasion to have
come here to force open the gates and doors of the Bastile, to free
you from this place. That would show a want of even common sense. Your
majesty’s mind is disturbed by anger; otherwise you would be far from
offending, groundlessly, the very one of your servants who has rendered
you the most important service of all.”

Louis perceived that he had gone too far; that the gates of the Bastile
were still closed upon him, whilst, by degrees, the floodgates were
gradually being opened, behind which the generous-hearted Fouquet had
restrained his anger. “I did not say that to humiliate you, Heaven
knows, monsieur,” he replied. “Only you are addressing yourself to me in
order to obtain a pardon, and I answer according to my conscience. And
so, judging by my conscience, the criminals we speak of are not worthy
of consideration or forgiveness.”

Fouquet was silent.

“What I do is as generous,” added the king, “as what you have done, for
I am in your power. I will even say it is more generous, inasmuch as you
place before me certain conditions upon which my liberty, my life, may
depend; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both.”

“I was wrong, certainly,” replied Fouquet. “Yes,--I had the appearance
of extorting a favor; I regret it, and entreat your majesty’s
forgiveness.”

“And you are forgiven, my dear Monsieur Fouquet,” said the king, with
a smile, which restored the serene expression of his features, which so
many circumstances had altered since the preceding evening.

“I have my own forgiveness,” replied the minister, with some degree of
persistence; “but M. d’Herblay, and M. du Vallon?”

“They will never obtain theirs, as long as I live,” replied the
inflexible king. “Do me the kindness not to speak of it again.”

“Your majesty shall be obeyed.”

“And you will bear me no ill-will for it?”

“Oh! no, sire; for I anticipated the event.”

“You had ‘anticipated’ that I should refuse to forgive those gentlemen?”

“Certainly; and all my measures were taken in consequence.”

“What do you mean to say?” cried the king, surprised.

“M. d’Herblay came, as may be said, to deliver himself into my hands. M.
d’Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my country. I
could not condemn M. d’Herblay to death; nor could I, on the other hand,
expose him to your majesty’s justifiable wrath; it would have been just
the same as if I had killed him myself.”

“Well! and what have you done?”

“Sire, I gave M. d’Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours’
start over all those your majesty might, probably, dispatch after him.”

“Be it so!” murmured the king. “But still, the world is wide enough
and large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses,
notwithstanding the ‘four hours’ start’ which you have given to M.
d’Herblay.”

“In giving him these four hours, sire, I knew I was giving him his life,
and he will save his life.”

“In what way?”

“After having galloped as hard as possible, with the four hours’ start,
before your musketeers, he will reach my chateau of Belle-Isle, where I
have given him a safe asylum.”

“That may be! But you forget that you have made me a present of
Belle-Isle.”

“But not for you to arrest my friends.”

“You take it back again, then?”

“As far as that goes--yes, sire.”

“My musketeers shall capture it, and the affair will be at an end.”

“Neither your musketeers, nor your whole army could take Belle-Isle,”
 said Fouquet, coldly. “Belle-Isle is impregnable.”

The king became perfectly livid; a lightning flash seemed to dart from
his eyes. Fouquet felt that he was lost, but he as not one to shrink
when the voice of honor spoke loudly within him. He bore the king’s
wrathful gaze; the latter swallowed his rage, and after a few moments’
silence, said, “Are we going to return to Vaux?”

“I am at your majesty’s orders,” replied Fouquet, with a low bow; “but
I think that your majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes
previous to appearing before your court.”

“We shall pass by the Louvre,” said the king. “Come.” And they left the
prison, passing before Baisemeaux, who looked completely bewildered as
he saw Marchiali once more leave; and, in his helplessness, tore out
the major portion of his few remaining hairs. It was perfectly true,
however, that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for the prisoner’s
release, and that the king wrote beneath it, “Seen and approved, Louis”;
a piece of madness that Baisemeaux, incapable of putting two ideas
together, acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead
with his own fist.



Chapter XXIV. The False King.

In the meantime, usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at
Vaux. Philippe gave orders that for his _petit lever_ the _grandes
entrees_, already prepared to appear before the king, should be
introduced. He determined to give this order notwithstanding the absence
of M. d’Herblay, who did not return--our readers know the reason. But
the prince, not believing that absence could be prolonged, wished,
as all rash spirits do, to try his valor and his fortune far from all
protection and instruction. Another reason urged him to this--Anne of
Austria was about to appear; the guilty mother was about to stand in the
presence of her sacrificed son. Philippe was not willing, if he had a
weakness, to render the man a witness of it before whom he was bound
thenceforth to display so much strength. Philippe opened his folding
doors, and several persons entered silently. Philippe did not stir
whilst his _valets de chambre_ dressed him. He had watched, the evening
before, all the habits of his brother, and played the king in such a
manner as to awaken no suspicion. He was thus completely dressed in
hunting costume when he received his visitors. His own memory and
the notes of Aramis announced everybody to him, first of all Anne of
Austria, to whom Monsieur gave his hand, and then Madame with M. de
Saint-Aignan. He smiled at seeing these countenances, but trembled on
recognizing his mother. That still so noble and imposing figure, ravaged
by pain, pleaded in his heart the cause of the famous queen who had
immolated a child to reasons of state. He found his mother still
handsome. He knew that Louis XIV. loved her, and he promised himself
to love her likewise, and not to prove a scourge to her old age. He
contemplated his brother with a tenderness easily to be understood.
The latter had usurped nothing, had cast no shades athwart his life. A
separate tree, he allowed the stem to rise without heeding its elevation
or majestic life. Philippe promised himself to be a kind brother to this
prince, who required nothing but gold to minister to his pleasures. He
bowed with a friendly air to Saint-Aignan, who was all reverences and
smiles, and trembling held out his hand to Henrietta, his sister-in-law,
whose beauty struck him; but he saw in the eyes of that princess an
expression of coldness which would facilitate, as he thought, their
future relations.

“How much more easy,” thought he, “it will be to be the brother of that
woman than her gallant, if she evinces towards me a coldness that my
brother could not have for her, but which is imposed upon me as a duty.”
 The only visit he dreaded at this moment was that of the queen; his
heart--his mind--had just been shaken by so violent a trial, that,
in spite of their firm temperament, they would not, perhaps, support
another shock. Happily the queen did not come. Then commenced, on the
part of Anne of Austria, a political dissertation upon the welcome M.
Fouquet had given to the house of France. She mixed up hostilities with
compliments addressed to the king, and questions as to his health, with
little maternal flatteries and diplomatic artifices.

“Well, my son,” said she, “are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet?”

“Saint-Aignan,” said Philippe, “have the goodness to go and inquire
after the queen.”

At these words, the first Philippe had pronounced aloud, the slight
difference that there was between his voice and that of the king was
sensible to maternal ears, and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her
son. Saint-Aignan left the room, and Philippe continued:

“Madame, I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of, you know I do
not--and you have even spoken well of him yourself.”

“That is true; therefore I only question you on the state of your
sentiments with respect to him.”

“Sire,” said Henrietta, “I, on my part, have always liked M. Fouquet. He
is a man of good taste,--a superior man.”

“A superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly,” added Monsieur;
“and who pays in gold all the orders I have on him.”

“Every one in this thinks too much of himself, and nobody for the
state,” said the old queen. “M. Fouquet, it is a fact, M. Fouquet is
ruining the state.”

“Well, mother!” replied Philippe, in rather a lower key, “do you
likewise constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert?”

“How is that?” replied the old queen, rather surprised.

“Why, in truth,” replied Philippe, “you speak that just as your old
friend Madame de Chevreuse would speak.”

“Why do you mention Madame de Chevreuse to me?” said she, “and what sort
of humor are you in to-day towards me?”

Philippe continued: “Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against
somebody? Has not Madame de Chevreuse been to pay you a visit, mother?”

“Monsieur, you speak to me now in such a manner that I can almost fancy
I am listening to your father.”

“My father did not like Madame de Chevreuse, and had good reason for not
liking her,” said the prince. “For my part, I like her no better than
_he_ did, and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did, to
sow divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money--why--”

“Well! what?” said Anne of Austria, proudly, herself provoking the
storm.

“Well!” replied the young man firmly, “I will drive Madame de Chevreuse
out of my kingdom--and with her all who meddle with its secrets and
mysteries.”

He had not calculated the effect of this terrible speech, or perhaps
he wished to judge the effect of it, like those who, suffering from a
chronic pain, and seeking to break the monotony of that suffering,
touch their wound to procure a sharper pang. Anne of Austria was nearly
fainting; her eyes, open but meaningless, ceased to see for several
seconds; she stretched out her arms towards her other son, who supported
and embraced her without fear of irritating the king.

“Sire,” murmured she, “you are treating your mother very cruelly.”

“In what respect, madame?” replied he. “I am only speaking of Madame de
Chevreuse; does my mother prefer Madame de Chevreuse to the security
of the state and of my person? Well, then, madame, I tell you Madame de
Chevreuse has returned to France to borrow money, and that she addressed
herself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret.”

“A certain secret!” cried Anne of Austria.

“Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had
committed, which is false,” added Philippe. “M. Fouquet rejected her
offers with indignation, preferring the esteem of the king to complicity
with such intriguers. Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M.
Colbert, and as she is insatiable, and was not satisfied with having
extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state, she has
taken a still bolder flight, in search of surer sources of supply. Is
that true, madame?”

“You know all, sire,” said the queen, more uneasy than irritated.

“Now,” continued Philippe, “I have good reason to dislike this fury, who
comes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others. If
Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed, and has concealed
them in the shadow of its clemency, I will not permit Madame de
Chevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate.”

The latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother, that
her son had pity on her. He took her hand and kissed it tenderly;
she did not feel that in that kiss, given in spite of repulsion
and bitterness of the heart, there was a pardon for eight years of
suffering. Philippe allowed the silence of a moment to swallow the
emotions that had just developed themselves. Then, with a cheerful
smile:

“We will not go to-day,” said he, “I have a plan.” And, turning towards
the door, he hoped to see Aramis, whose absence began to alarm him. The
queen-mother wished to leave the room.

“Remain where you are, mother,” said he, “I wish you to make your peace
with M. Fouquet.”

“I bear M. Fouquet no ill-will; I only dreaded his prodigalities.”

“We will put that to rights, and will take nothing of the superintendent
but his good qualities.”

“What is your majesty looking for?” said Henrietta, seeing the king’s
eyes constantly turned towards the door, and wishing to let fly a little
poisoned arrow at his heart, supposing he was so anxiously expecting
either La Valliere or a letter from her.

“My sister,” said the young man, who had divined her thought, thanks to
that marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to
allow him the exercise, “my sister, I am expecting a most distinguished
man, a most able counselor, whom I wish to present to you all,
recommending him to your good graces. Ah! come in, then, D’Artagnan.”

“What does your majesty wish?” said D’Artagnan, appearing.

“Where is monsieur the bishop of Vannes, your friend?”

“Why, sire--”

“I am waiting for him, and he does not come. Let him be sought for.”

D’Artagnan remained for an instant stupefied; but soon, reflecting that
Aramis had left Vaux privately on a mission from the king, he concluded
that the king wished to preserve the secret. “Sire,” replied he, “does
your majesty absolutely require M. d’Herblay to be brought to you?”

“Absolutely is not the word,” said Philippe; “I do not want him so
particularly as that; but if he can be found--”

“I thought so,” said D’Artagnan to himself.

“Is this M. d’Herblay the bishop of Vannes?”

“Yes, madame.”

“A friend of M. Fouquet?”

“Yes, madame; an old musketeer.”

Anne of Austria blushed.

“One of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies.”

The old queen repented of having wished to bite; she broke off the
conversation, in order to preserve the rest of her teeth. “Whatever may
be your choice, sire,” said she, “I have no doubt it will be excellent.”

All bowed in support of that sentiment.

“You will find in him,” continued Philippe, “the depth and penetration
of M. de Richelieu, without the avarice of M. de Mazarin!”

“A prime minister, sire?” said Monsieur, in a fright.

“I will tell you all about that, brother; but it is strange that M.
d’Herblay is not here!”

He called out:

“Let M. Fouquet be informed that I wish to speak to him--oh! before you,
before you; do not retire!”

M. de Saint-Aignan returned, bringing satisfactory news of the queen,
who only kept her bed from precaution, and to have strength to carry out
the king’s wishes. Whilst everybody was seeking M. Fouquet and Aramis,
the new king quietly continued his experiments, and everybody, family,
officers, servants, had not the least suspicion of his identity, his
air, his voice, and manners were so like the king’s. On his side,
Philippe, applying to all countenances the accurate descriptions and
key-notes of character supplied by his accomplice Aramis, conducted
himself so as not to give birth to a doubt in the minds of those who
surrounded him. Nothing from that time could disturb the usurper. With
what strange facility had Providence just reversed the loftiest fortune
of the world to substitute the lowliest in its stead! Philippe admired
the goodness of God with regard to himself, and seconded it with all the
resources of his admirable nature. But he felt, at times, something like
a specter gliding between him and the rays of his new glory. Aramis
did not appear. The conversation had languished in the royal family;
Philippe, preoccupied, forgot to dismiss his brother and Madame
Henrietta. The latter were astonished, and began, by degrees, to
lose all patience. Anne of Austria stooped towards her son’s ear and
addressed some words to him in Spanish. Philippe was completely ignorant
of that language, and grew pale at this unexpected obstacle. But, as
if the spirit of the imperturbable Aramis had covered him with his
infallibility, instead of appearing disconcerted, Philippe rose. “Well!
what?” said Anne of Austria.

“What is all that noise?” said Philippe, turning round towards the door
of the second staircase.

And a voice was heard saying, “This way, this way! A few steps more,
sire!”

“The voice of M. Fouquet,” said D’Artagnan, who was standing close to
the queen-mother.

“Then M. d’Herblay cannot be far off,” added Philippe.

But he then saw what he little thought to have beheld so near to him.
All eyes were turned towards the door at which M. Fouquet was expected
to enter; but it was not M. Fouquet who entered. A terrible cry
resounded from all corners of the chamber, a painful cry uttered by
the king and all present. It is given to but few men, even those
whose destiny contains the strangest elements, and accidents the
most wonderful, to contemplate such a spectacle similar to that which
presented itself in the royal chamber at that moment. The half-closed
shutters only admitted the entrance of an uncertain light passing
through thick violet velvet curtains lined with silk. In this soft
shade, the eyes were by degrees dilated, and every one present saw
others rather with imagination than with actual sight. There could not,
however, escape, in these circumstances, one of the surrounding details;
and the new object which presented itself appeared as luminous as though
it shone out in full sunlight. So it happened with Louis XIV., when he
showed himself, pale and frowning, in the doorway of the secret stairs.
The face of Fouquet appeared behind him, stamped with sorrow and
determination. The queen-mother, who perceived Louis XIV., and who held
the hand of Philippe, uttered a cry of which we have spoken, as if she
beheld a phantom. Monsieur was bewildered, and kept turning his head in
astonishment from one to the other. Madame made a step forward, thinking
she was looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror.
And, in fact, the illusion was possible. The two princes, both pale as
death--for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful
state of Philippe--trembling, clenching their hands convulsively,
measured each other with looks, and darted their glances, sharp as
poniards, at each other. Silent, panting, bending forward, they appeared
as if about to spring upon an enemy. The unheard-of resemblance of
countenance, gesture, shape, height, even to the resemblance of costume,
produced by chance--for Louis XIV. had been to the Louvre and put on a
violet-colored dress--the perfect analogy of the two princes, completed
the consternation of Anne of Austria. And yet she did not at once guess
the truth. There are misfortunes in life so truly dreadful that no one
will at first accept them; people rather believe in the supernatural and
the impossible. Louis had not reckoned on these obstacles. He expected
that he had only to appear to be acknowledged. A living sun, he could
not endure the suspicion of equality with any one. He did not admit that
every torch should not become darkness at the instant he shone out with
his conquering ray. At the aspect of Philippe, then, he was perhaps more
terrified than any one round him, and his silence, his immobility
were, this time, a concentration and a calm which precede the violent
explosions of concentrated passion.

But Fouquet! who shall paint his emotion and stupor in presence of this
living portrait of his master! Fouquet thought Aramis was right, that
this newly-arrived was a king as pure in his race as the other, and
that, for having repudiated all participation in this _coup d’etat_,
so skillfully got up by the General of the Jesuits, he must be a mad
enthusiast, unworthy of ever dipping his hands in political grand
strategy work. And then it was the blood of Louis XIII. which Fouquet
was sacrificing to the blood of Louis XIII.; it was to a selfish
ambition he was sacrificing a noble ambition; to the right of keeping
he sacrificed the right of having. The whole extent of his fault was
revealed to him at simple sight of the pretender. All that passed in the
mind of Fouquet was lost upon the persons present. He had five minutes
to focus meditation on this point of conscience; five minutes, that is
to say five ages, during which the two kings and their family scarcely
found energy to breathe after so terrible a shock. D’Artagnan, leaning
against the wall, in front of Fouquet, with his hand to his brow, asked
himself the cause of such a wonderful prodigy. He could not have said at
once why he doubted, but he knew assuredly that he had reason to doubt,
and that in this meeting of the two Louis XIV.s lay all the doubt and
difficulty that during late days had rendered the conduct of Aramis so
suspicious to the musketeer. These ideas were, however, enveloped in a
haze, a veil of mystery. The actors in this assembly seemed to swim in
the vapors of a confused waking. Suddenly Louis XIV., more impatient and
more accustomed to command, ran to one of the shutters, which he opened,
tearing the curtains in his eagerness. A flood of living light entered
the chamber, and made Philippe draw back to the alcove. Louis seized
upon this movement with eagerness, and addressing himself to the queen:

“My mother,” said he, “do you not acknowledge your son, since every one
here has forgotten his king!” Anne of Austria started, and raised her
arms towards Heaven, without being able to articulate a single word.

“My mother,” said Philippe, with a calm voice, “do you not acknowledge
your son?” And this time, in his turn, Louis drew back.

As to Anne of Austria, struck suddenly in head and heart with fell
remorse, she lost her equilibrium. No one aiding her, for all were
petrified, she sank back in her fauteuil, breathing a weak, trembling
sigh. Louis could not endure the spectacle and the affront. He bounded
towards D’Artagnan, over whose brain a vertigo was stealing and who
staggered as he caught at the door for support.

“_A moi! mousquetaire!_” said he. “Look us in the face and say which is
the paler, he or I!”

This cry roused D’Artagnan, and stirred in his heart the fibers of
obedience. He shook his head, and, without more hesitation, he walked
straight up to Philippe, on whose shoulder he laid his hand, saying,
“Monsieur, you are my prisoner!”

Philippe did not raise his eyes towards Heaven, nor stir from the spot,
where he seemed nailed to the floor, his eye intently fixed upon the
king his brother. He reproached him with a sublime silence for all
misfortunes past, all tortures to come. Against this language of the
soul the king felt he had no power; he cast down his eyes, dragging away
precipitately his brother and sister, forgetting his mother, sitting
motionless within three paces of the son whom she left a second time to
be condemned to death. Philippe approached Anne of Austria, and said to
her, in a soft and nobly agitated voice:

“If I were not your son, I should curse you, my mother, for having
rendered me so unhappy.”

D’Artagnan felt a shudder pass through the marrow of his bones. He
bowed respectfully to the young prince, and said as he bent, “Excuse me,
monseigneur, I am but a soldier, and my oaths are his who has just left
the chamber.”

“Thank you, M. d’Artagnan.... What has become of M. d’Herblay?”

“M. d’Herblay is in safety, monseigneur,” said a voice behind them; “and
no one, while I live and am free, shall cause a hair to fall from his
head.”

“Monsieur Fouquet!” said the prince, smiling sadly.

“Pardon me, monseigneur,” said Fouquet, kneeling, “but he who is just
gone out from hence was my guest.”

“Here are,” murmured Philippe, with a sigh, “brave friends and good
hearts. They make me regret the world. On, M. d’Artagnan, I follow you.”

At the moment the captain of the musketeers was about to leave the room
with his prisoner, Colbert appeared, and, after remitting an order from
the king to D’Artagnan, retired. D’Artagnan read the paper, and then
crushed it in his hand with rage.

“What is it?” asked the prince.

“Read, monseigneur,” replied the musketeer.

Philippe read the following words, hastily traced by the hand of the
king:

“M. d’Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the Ile Sainte-Marguerite.
He will cover his face with an iron vizor, which the prisoner shall
never raise except at peril of his life.”

“That is just,” said Philippe, with resignation; “I am ready.”

“Aramis was right,” said Fouquet, in a low voice, to the musketeer,
“this one is every whit as much a king as the other.”

“More so!” replied D’Artagnan. “He wanted only you and me.”



Chapter XXV. In Which Porthos Thinks He Is Pursuing a Duchy.

Aramis and Porthos, having profited by the time granted them by Fouquet,
did honor to the French cavalry by their speed. Porthos did not clearly
understand on what kind of mission he was forced to display so much
velocity; but as he saw Aramis spurring on furiously, he, Porthos,
spurred on in the same way. They had soon, in this manner, placed twelve
leagues between them and Vaux; they were then obliged to change horses,
and organize a sort of post arrangement. It was during a relay that
Porthos ventured to interrogate Aramis discreetly.

“Hush!” replied the latter, “know only that our fortune depends on our
speed.”

As if Porthos had still been the musketeer, without a sou or a _maille_
of 1626, he pushed forward. That magic word “fortune” always means
something in the human ear. It means _enough_ for those who have
nothing; it means _too much_ for those who have enough.

“I shall be made a duke!” said Porthos, aloud. He was speaking to
himself.

“That is possible,” replied Aramis, smiling after his own fashion, as
Porthos’s horse passed him. Aramis felt, notwithstanding, as though his
brain were on fire; the activity of the body had not yet succeeded
in subduing that of the mind. All there is of raging passion, mental
toothache or mortal threat, raged, gnawed and grumbled in the thoughts
of the unhappy prelate. His countenance exhibited visible traces of this
rude combat. Free on the highway to abandon himself to every impression
of the moment, Aramis did not fail to swear at every start of his horse,
at every inequality in the road. Pale, at times inundated with boiling
sweats, then again dry and icy, he flogged his horses till the blood
streamed from their sides. Porthos, whose dominant fault was not
sensibility, groaned at this. Thus traveled they on for eight long
hours, and then arrived at Orleans. It was four o’clock in the
afternoon. Aramis, on observing this, judged that nothing showed pursuit
to be a possibility. It would be without example that a troop capable
of taking him and Porthos should be furnished with relays sufficient to
perform forty leagues in eight hours. Thus, admitting pursuit, which was
not at all manifest, the fugitives were five hours in advance of their
pursuers.

Aramis thought that there might be no imprudence in taking a little
rest, but that to continue would make the matter more certain. Twenty
leagues more, performed with the same rapidity, twenty more leagues
devoured, and no one, not even D’Artagnan, could overtake the enemies
of the king. Aramis felt obliged, therefore, to inflict upon Porthos the
pain of mounting on horseback again. They rode on till seven o’clock in
the evening, and had only one post more between them and Blois. But here
a diabolical accident alarmed Aramis greatly. There were no horses at
the post. The prelate asked himself by what infernal machination
his enemies had succeeded in depriving him of the means of going
further,--he who never recognized chance as a deity, who found a
cause for every accident, preferred believing that the refusal of the
postmaster, at such an hour, in such a country, was the consequence of
an order emanating from above: an order given with a view of stopping
short the king-maker in the midst of his flight. But at the moment he
was about to fly into a passion, so as to procure either a horse or an
explanation, he was struck with the recollection that the Comte de la
Fere lived in the neighborhood.

“I am not traveling,” said he; “I do not want horses for a whole
stage. Find me two horses to go and pay a visit to a nobleman of my
acquaintance who resides near this place.”

“What nobleman?” asked the postmaster.

“M. le Comte de la Fere.”

“Oh!” replied the postmaster, uncovering with respect, “a very worthy
nobleman. But, whatever may be my desire to make myself agreeable to
him, I cannot furnish you with horses, for all mine are engaged by M. le
Duc de Beaufort.”

“Indeed!” said Aramis, much disappointed.

“Only,” continued the postmaster, “if you will put up with a little
carriage I have, I will harness an old blind horse who has still his
legs left, and peradventure will draw you to the house of M. le Comte de
la Fere.”

“It is worth a louis,” said Aramis.

“No, monsieur, such a ride is worth no more than a crown; that is what
M. Grimaud, the comte’s intendant, always pays me when he makes use of
that carriage; and I should not wish the Comte de la Fere to have to
reproach me with having imposed on one of his friends.”

“As you please,” said Aramis, “particularly as regards disobliging the
Comte de la Fere; only I think I have a right to give you a louis for
your idea.”

“Oh! doubtless,” replied the postmaster with delight. And he himself
harnessed the ancient horse to the creaking carriage. In the meantime
Porthos was curious to behold. He imagined he had discovered a clew to
the secret, and he felt pleased, because a visit to Athos, in the first
place, promised him much satisfaction, and, in the next, gave him the
hope of finding at the same time a good bed and good supper. The master,
having got the carriage ready, ordered one of his men to drive the
strangers to La Fere. Porthos took his seat by the side of Aramis,
whispering in his ear, “I understand.”

“Aha!” said Aramis, “and what do you understand, my friend?”

“We are going, on the part of the king, to make some great proposal to
Athos.”

“Pooh!” said Aramis.

“You need tell me nothing about it,” added the worthy Porthos,
endeavoring to reseat himself so as to avoid the jolting, “you need tell
me nothing, I shall guess.”

“Well! do, my friend; guess away.”

They arrived at Athos’s dwelling about nine o’clock in the evening,
favored by a splendid moon. This cheerful light rejoiced Porthos beyond
expression; but Aramis appeared annoyed by it in an equal degree. He
could not help showing something of this to Porthos, who replied--“Ay!
ay! I guess how it is! the mission is a secret one.”

These were his last words in the carriage. The driver interrupted him by
saying, “Gentlemen, we have arrived.”

Porthos and his companion alighted before the gate of the little
chateau, where we are about to meet again our old acquaintances Athos
and Bragelonne, the latter of whom had disappeared since the discovery
of the infidelity of La Valliere. If there be one saying truer than
another, it is this: great griefs contain within themselves the germ
of consolation. This painful wound, inflicted upon Raoul, had drawn
him nearer to his father again; and God knows how sweet were the
consolations which flowed from the eloquent mouth and generous heart of
Athos. The wound was not cicatrized, but Athos, by dint of conversing
with his son and mixing a little more of his life with that of the young
man, had brought him to understand that this pang of a first infidelity
is necessary to every human existence; and that no one has loved without
encountering it. Raoul listened, again and again, but never understood.
Nothing replaces in the deeply afflicted heart the remembrance and
thought of the beloved object. Raoul then replied to the reasoning of
his father:

“Monsieur, all that you tell me is true; I believe that no one has
suffered in the affections of the heart so much as you have; but you
are a man too great by reason of intelligence, and too severely tried by
adverse fortune not to allow for the weakness of the soldier who suffers
for the first time. I am paying a tribute that will not be paid a second
time; permit me to plunge myself so deeply in my grief that I may forget
myself in it, that I may drown even my reason in it.”

“Raoul! Raoul!”

“Listen, monsieur. Never shall I accustom myself to the idea that
Louise, the chastest and most innocent of women, has been able to so
basely deceive a man so honest and so true a lover as myself. Never can
I persuade myself that I see that sweet and noble mask change into
a hypocritical lascivious face. Louise lost! Louise infamous!
Ah! monseigneur, that idea is much more cruel to me than Raoul
abandoned--Raoul unhappy!”

Athos then employed the heroic remedy. He defended Louise against Raoul,
and justified her perfidy by her love. “A woman who would have yielded
to a king because he is a king,” said he, “would deserve to be styled
infamous; but Louise loves Louis. Young, both, they have forgotten, he
his rank, she her vows. Love absolves everything, Raoul. The two young
people love each other with sincerity.”

And when he had dealt this severe poniard-thrust, Athos, with a sigh,
saw Raoul bound away beneath the rankling wound, and fly to the thickest
recesses of the wood, or the solitude of his chamber, whence, an hour
after, he would return, pale, trembling, but subdued. Then, coming up
to Athos with a smile, he would kiss his hand, like the dog who, having
been beaten, caresses a respected master, to redeem his fault. Raoul
redeemed nothing but his weakness, and only confessed his grief. Thus
passed away the days that followed that scene in which Athos had
so violently shaken the indomitable pride of the king. Never, when
conversing with his son, did he make any allusion to that scene; never
did he give him the details of that vigorous lecture, which might,
perhaps, have consoled the young man, by showing him his rival humbled.
Athos did not wish that the offended lover should forget the respect due
to his king. And when Bragelonne, ardent, angry, and melancholy, spoke
with contempt of royal words, of the equivocal faith which certain
madmen draw from promises that emanate from thrones, when, passing over
two centuries, with that rapidity of a bird that traverses a narrow
strait to go from one continent to the other, Raoul ventured to predict
the time in which kings would be esteemed as less than other men, Athos
said to him, in his serene, persuasive voice, “You are right, Raoul;
all that you say will happen; kings will lose their privileges, as
stars which have survived their aeons lose their splendor. But when that
moment comes, Raoul, we shall be dead. And remember well what I say
to you. In this world, all, men, women, and kings, must live for the
present. We can only live for the future for God.”

This was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were, as usual, conversing,
and walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the
park, when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the
hour of dinner or the arrival of a visitor, was rung; and, without
attaching any importance to it, he turned towards the house with his
son; and at the end of the alley they found themselves in the presence
of Aramis and Porthos.



Chapter XXVI. The Last Adieux.

Raoul uttered a cry, and affectionately embraced Porthos. Aramis and
Athos embraced like old men; and this embrace itself being a question
for Aramis, he immediately said, “My friend, we have not long to remain
with you.”

“Ah!” said the comte.

“Only time to tell you of my good fortune,” interrupted Porthos.

“Ah!” said Raoul.

Athos looked silently at Aramis, whose somber air had already appeared
to him very little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted.

“What is the good fortune that has happened to you? Let us hear it,”
 said Raoul, with a smile.

“The king has made me a duke,” said the worthy Porthos, with an air of
mystery, in the ear of the young man, “a duke by _brevet_.”

But the _asides_ of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by
everybody. His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring. Athos
heard him, and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start. The
latter took Athos by the arm, and, after having asked Porthos’s
permission to say a word to his friend in private, “My dear Athos,” he
began, “you see me overwhelmed with grief and trouble.”

“With grief and trouble, my dear friend?” cried the comte; “oh, what?”

“In two words. I have conspired against the king; that conspiracy has
failed, and, at this moment, I am doubtless pursued.”

“You are pursued!--a conspiracy! Eh! my friend, what do you tell me?”

“The saddest truth. I am entirely ruined.”

“Well, but Porthos--this title of duke--what does all that mean?”

“That is the subject of my severest pain; that is the deepest of my
wounds. I have, believing in infallible success, drawn Porthos into my
conspiracy. He threw himself into it, as you know he would do, with all
his strength, without knowing what he was about; and now he is as much
compromised as myself--as completely ruined as I am.”

“Good God!” And Athos turned towards Porthos, who was smiling
complacently.

“I must make you acquainted with the whole. Listen to me,” continued
Aramis; and he related the history as we know it. Athos, during the
recital, several times felt the sweat break from his forehead. “It was a
great idea,” said he, “but a great error.”

“For which I am punished, Athos.”

“Therefore, I will not tell you my entire thought.”

“Tell it, nevertheless.”

“It is a crime.”

“A capital crime; I know it is. _Lese majeste_.”

“Porthos! poor Porthos!”

“What would you advise me to do? Success, as I have told you, was
certain.”

“M. Fouquet is an honest man.”

“And I a fool for having so ill-judged him,” said Aramis. “Oh, the
wisdom of man! Oh, millstone that grinds the world! and which is one day
stopped by a grain of sand which has fallen, no one knows how, between
its wheels.”

“Say by a diamond, Aramis. But the thing is done. How do you think of
acting?”

“I am taking away Porthos. The king will never believe that that worthy
man has acted innocently. He never can believe that Porthos has thought
he was serving the king, whilst acting as he has done. His head would
pay my fault. It shall not, must not, be so.”

“You are taking him away, whither?”

“To Belle-Isle, at first. That is an impregnable place of refuge. Then,
I have the sea, and a vessel to pass over into England, where I have
many relations.”

“You? in England?”

“Yes, or else in Spain, where I have still more.”

“But, our excellent Porthos! you ruin him, for the king will confiscate
all his property.”

“All is provided for. I know how, when once in Spain, to reconcile
myself with Louis XIV., and restore Porthos to favor.”

“You have credit, seemingly, Aramis!” said Athos, with a discreet air.

“Much; and at the service of my friends.”

These words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand.

“Thank you,” replied the comte.

“And while we are on this head,” said Aramis, “you also are a
malcontent; you also, Raoul, have griefs to lay to the king. Follow our
example; pass over into Belle-Isle. Then we shall see, I guarantee upon
my honor, that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on
the subject of this son of Louis XIII., who is an Infante likewise,
and whom France detains inhumanly. Now, as Louis XIV. would have no
inclination for a war on that subject, I will answer for an arrangement,
the result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me, and a
duchy in France to you, who are already a grandee of Spain. Will you
join us?”

“No; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with;
it is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal
races. Doing what you propose, I should become the obliged of the king;
I should certainly be the gainer on that ground, but I should be a loser
in my conscience.--No, thank you!”

“Then give me two things, Athos,--your absolution.”

“Oh! I give it you if you really wished to avenge the weak and oppressed
against the oppressor.”

“That is sufficient for me,” said Aramis, with a blush which was lost
in the obscurity of the night. “And now, give me your two best horses
to gain the second post, as I have been refused any under the pretext of
the Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country.”

“You shall have the two best horses, Aramis; and again I recommend poor
Porthos strongly to your care.”

“Oh! I have no fear on that score. One word more: do you think I am
maneuvering for him as I ought?”

“The evil being committed, yes; for the king would not pardon him, and
you have, whatever may be said, always a supporter in M. Fouquet, who
will not abandon you, he being himself compromised, notwithstanding his
heroic action.”

“You are right. And that is why, instead of gaining the sea at once,
which would proclaim my fear and guilt, that is why I remain upon French
ground. But Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be,
English, Spanish, or Roman; all will depend, with me, on the standard I
shall think proper to unfurl.”

“How so?”

“It was I who fortified Belle-Isle; and, so long as I defend it, nobody
can take Belle-Isle from me. And then, as you have said just now, M.
Fouquet is there. Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature
of M. Fouquet.”

“That is true. Nevertheless, be prudent. The king is both cunning and
strong.” Aramis smiled.

“I again recommend Porthos to you,” repeated the count, with a sort of
cold persistence.

“Whatever becomes of me, count,” replied Aramis, in the same tone, “our
brother Porthos will fare as I do--or _better_.”

Athos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis, and turned to embrace
Porthos with emotion.

“I was born lucky, was I not?” murmured the latter, transported with
happiness, as he folded his cloak round him.

“Come, my dear friend,” said Aramis.

Raoul had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses. The
group was already divided. Athos saw his two friends on the point of
departure, and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed
upon his heart.

“It is strange,” thought he, “whence comes the inclination I feel to
embrace Porthos once more?” At that moment Porthos turned round, and
he came towards his old friend with open arms. This last endearment was
tender as in youth, as in times when hearts were warm--life happy. And
then Porthos mounted his horse. Aramis came back once more to throw
his arms round the neck of Athos. The latter watched them along the
high-road, elongated by the shade, in their white cloaks. Like phantoms
they seemed to enlarge on their departure from the earth, and it was not
in the mist, but in the declivity of the ground that they disappeared.
At the end of the perspective, both seemed to have given a spring with
their feet, which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land.

Then Athos, with a very heavy heart, returned towards the house, saying
to Bragelonne, “Raoul, I don’t know what it is that has just told me
that I have seen those two for the last time.”

“It does not astonish me, monsieur, that you should have such a
thought,” replied the young man, “for I have at this moment the same,
and think also that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d’Herblay
again.”

“Oh! you,” replied the count, “you speak like a man rendered sad by a
different cause; you see everything in black; you are young, and if you
chance never to see those old friends again, it will because they no
longer exist in the world in which you have yet many years to pass. But
I--”

Raoul shook his head sadly, and leaned upon the shoulder of the count,
without either of them finding another word in their hearts, which were
ready to overflow.

All at once a noise of horses and voices, from the extremity of the road
to Blois, attracted their attention that way. Flambeaux-bearers shook
their torches merrily among the trees of their route, and turned round,
from time to time, to avoid distancing the horsemen who followed them.
These flames, this noise, this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned
horses, formed a strange contrast in the middle of the night with the
melancholy and almost funereal disappearance of the two shadows of
Aramis and Porthos. Athos went towards the house; but he had hardly
reached the parterre, when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze; all
the flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road. A cry was heard
of “M. le Duc de Beaufort”--and Athos sprang towards the door of his
house. But the duke had already alighted from his horse, and was looking
around him.

“I am here, monseigneur,” said Athos.

“Ah! good evening, dear count,” said the prince, with that frank
cordiality which won him so many hearts. “Is it too late for a friend?”

“Ah! my dear prince, come in!” said the count.

And, M. de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos, they entered the
house, followed by Raoul, who walked respectfully and modestly among the
officers of the prince, with several of whom he was acquainted.



Chapter XXVII. Monsieur de Beaufort.

The prince turned round at the moment when Raoul, in order to leave him
alone with Athos, was shutting the door, and preparing to go with the
other officers into an adjoining apartment.

“Is that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of?”
 asked M. de Beaufort.

“It is, monseigneur.”

“He is quite the soldier; let him stay, count, we cannot spare him.”

“Remain, Raoul, since monseigneur permits it,” said Athos.

“_Ma foi!_ he is tall and handsome!” continued the duke. “Will you give
him to me, monseigneur, if I ask him of you?”

“How am I to understand you, monseigneur?” said Athos.

“Why, I call upon you to bid you farewell.”

“Farewell!”

“Yes, in good truth. Have you no idea of what I am about to become?”

“Why, I suppose, what you have always been, monseigneur,--a valiant
prince, and an excellent gentleman.”

“I am going to become an African prince,--a Bedouin gentleman. The king
is sending me to make conquests among the Arabs.”

“What is this you tell me, monseigneur?”

“Strange, is it not? I, the Parisian _par essence_, I who have reigned
in the faubourgs, and have been called King of the Halles,--I am going
to pass from the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli; from a
Frondeur I am becoming an adventurer!”

“Oh, monseigneur, if you did not yourself tell me that--”

“It would not be credible, would it? Believe me, nevertheless, and we
have but to bid each other farewell. This is what comes of getting into
favor again.”

“Into favor?”

“Yes. You smile. Ah, my dear count, do you know why I have accepted this
enterprise, can you guess?”

“Because your highness loves glory above--everything.”

“Oh! no; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages. I see no glory
in that, for my part, and it is more probable that I shall there meet
with something else. But I have wished, and still wish earnestly, my
dear count, that my life should have that last _facet_, after all the
whimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years. For,
in short, you must admit that it is sufficiently strange to be born
the grandson of a king, to have made war against kings, to have been
reckoned among the powers of the age, to have maintained my rank, to
feel Henry IV. within me, to be great admiral of France--and then to go
and get killed at Gigelli, among all those Turks, Saracens, and Moors.”

“Monseigneur, you harp with strange persistence on that theme,” said
Athos, in an agitated voice. “How can you suppose that so brilliant a
destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene?”

“And can you believe, upright and simple as you are, that if I go into
Africa for this ridiculous motive, I will not endeavor to come out of it
without ridicule? Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me? And
to be spoken of, nowadays, when there are Monsieur le Prince, M. de
Turenne, and many others, my contemporaries, I, admiral of France,
grandson of Henry IV., king of Paris, have I anything left but to get
myself killed? _Cordieu!_ I will be talked of, I tell you; I shall be
killed whether or not; if not there, somewhere else.”

“Why, monseigneur, this is mere exaggeration; and hitherto you have
shown nothing exaggerated save in bravery.”

“_Peste!_ my dear friend, there is bravery in facing scurvy, dysentery,
locusts, poisoned arrows, as my ancestor St. Louis did. Do you know
those fellows still use poisoned arrows? And then, you know me of old,
I fancy, and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing, I
perform it in grim earnest.”

“Yes, you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes.”

“Ay, but you aided me in that, my master; and, _a propos_, I turn this
way and that, without seeing my old friend, M. Vaugrimaud. How is he?”

“M. Vaugrimaud is still your highness’s most respectful servant,” said
Athos, smiling.

“I have a hundred pistoles here for him, which I bring as a legacy. My
will is made, count.”

“Ah! monseigneur! monseigneur!”

“And you may understand that if Grimaud’s name were to appear in my
will--” The duke began to laugh; then addressing Raoul, who, from the
commencement of this conversation, had sunk into a profound reverie,
“Young man,” said he, “I know there is to be found here a certain De
Vouvray wine, and I believe--” Raoul left the room precipitately to
order the wine. In the meantime M. de Beaufort took the hand of Athos.

“What do you mean to do with him?” asked he.

“Nothing at present, monseigneur.”

“Ah! yes, I know; since the passion of the king for La Valliere.”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“That is all true, then, is it? I think I know her, that little La
Valliere. She is not particularly handsome, if I remember right?”

“No, monseigneur,” said Athos.

“Do you know whom she reminds me of?”

“Does she remind your highness of any one?”

“She reminds me of a very agreeable girl, whose mother lived in the
Halles.”

“Ah! ah!” said Athos, smiling.

“Oh! the good old times,” added M. de Beaufort. “Yes, La Valliere
reminds me of that girl.”

“Who had a son, had she not?” [3]

“I believe she had,” replied the duke, with careless _naivete_ and a
complaisant forgetfulness, of which no words could translate the tone
and the vocal expression. “Now, here is poor Raoul, who is your son, I
believe.”

“Yes, he is my son, monseigneur.”

“And the poor lad has been cut out by the king, and he frets.”

“Still better, monseigneur, he abstains.”

“You are going to let the boy rust in idleness; it is a mistake. Come,
give him to me.”

“My wish is to keep him at home, monseigneur. I have no longer anything
in the world but him, and as long as he likes to remain--”

“Well, well,” replied the duke. “I could, nevertheless, have soon put
matters to rights again. I assure you, I think he has in him the
stuff of which marechals of France are made; I have seen more than one
produced from less likely rough material.”

“That is very possible, monseigneur; but it is the king who makes
marechals of France, and Raoul will never accept anything of the king.”

Raoul interrupted this conversation by his return. He preceded Grimaud,
whose still steady hands carried the plateau with one glass and a bottle
of the duke’s favorite wine. On seeing his old _protege_, the duke
uttered an exclamation of pleasure.

“Grimaud! Good evening, Grimaud!” said he; “how goes it?”

The servant bowed profoundly, as much gratified as his noble
interlocutor.

“Two old friends!” said the duke, shaking honest Grimaud’s shoulder
after a vigorous fashion; which was followed by another still more
profound and delighted bow from Grimaud.

“But what is this, count, only one glass?”

“I should not think of drinking with your highness, unless your highness
permitted me,” replied Athos, with noble humility.

“_Cordieu!_ you were right to bring only one glass, we will both drink
out of it, like two brothers in arms. Begin, count.”

“Do me the honor,” said Athos, gently putting back the glass.

“You are a charming friend,” replied the Duc de Beaufort, who drank, and
passed the goblet to his companion. “But that is not all,” continued he,
“I am still thirsty, and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man
who stands here. I carry good luck with me, vicomte,” said he to Raoul;
“wish for something while drinking out of my glass, and may the black
plague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass!” He held the
goblet to Raoul, who hastily moistened his lips, and replied with the
same promptitude:

“I have wished for something, monseigneur.” His eyes sparkled with a
gloomy fire, and the blood mounted to his cheeks; he terrified Athos, if
only with his smile.

“And what have you wished for?” replied the duke, sinking back into his
fauteuil, whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud, and
with the other gave him a purse.

“Will you promise me, monseigneur, to grant me what I wish for?”

“_Pardieu!_ That is agreed upon.”

“I wished, monsieur le duc, to go with you to Gigelli.”

Athos became pale, and was unable to conceal his agitation. The duke
looked at his friend, as if desirous to assist him to parry this
unexpected blow.

“That is difficult, my dear vicomte, very difficult,” added he, in a
lower tone of voice.

“Pardon me, monseigneur, I have been indiscreet,” replied Raoul, in a
firm voice; “but as you yourself invited me to wish--”

“To wish to leave me?” said Athos.

“Oh! monsieur--can you imagine--”

“Well, _mordieu!_” cried the duke, “the young vicomte is right! What can
he do here? He will go moldy with grief.”

Raoul blushed, and the excitable prince continued: “War is a
distraction: we gain everything by it; we can only lose one thing by
it--life--then so much the worse!”

“That is to say, memory,” said Raoul, eagerly; “and that is to say, so
much the better!”

He repented of having spoken so warmly when he saw Athos rise and open
the window; which was, doubtless, to conceal his emotion. Raoul sprang
towards the comte, but the latter had already overcome his emotion, and
turned to the lights with a serene and impassible countenance. “Well,
come,” said the duke, “let us see! Shall he go, or shall he not? If he
goes, comte, he shall be my aide-de-camp, my son.”

“Monseigneur!” cried Raoul, bending his knee.

“Monseigneur!” cried Athos, taking the hand of the duke; “Raoul shall do
just as he likes.”

“Oh! no, monsieur, just as you like,” interrupted the young man.

“_Par la corbleu!_” said the prince in his turn, “it is neither the
comte nor the vicomte that shall have his way, it is I. I will take him
away. The marine offers a superb fortune, my friend.”

Raoul smiled again so sadly, that this time Athos felt his heart
penetrated by it, and replied to him by a severe look. Raoul
comprehended it all; he recovered his calmness, and was so guarded, that
not another word escaped him. The duke at length rose, on observing the
advanced hour, and said, with animation, “I am in great haste, but if I
am told I have lost time in talking with a friend, I will reply I have
gained--on the balance--a most excellent recruit.”

“Pardon me, monsieur le duc,” interrupted Raoul, “do not tell the king
so, for it is not the king I wish to serve.”

“Eh! my friend, whom, then, will you serve? The times are past when
you might have said, ‘I belong to M. de Beaufort.’ No, nowadays, we all
belong to the king, great or small. Therefore, if you serve on board my
vessels, there can be nothing equivocal about it, my dear vicomte; it
will be the king you will serve.”

Athos waited with a kind of impatient joy for the reply about to be made
to this embarrassing question by Raoul, the intractable enemy of the
king, his rival. The father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the
desire. He was thankful to M. de Beaufort, whose lightness or generous
reflection had thrown an impediment in the way of the departure of a
son, now his only joy. But Raoul, still firm and tranquil, replied:
“Monsieur le duc, the objection you make I have already considered in my
mind. I will serve on board your vessels, because you do me the honor
to take me with you; but I shall there serve a more powerful master than
the king: I shall serve God!”

“God! how so?” said the duke and Athos together.

“My intention is to make profession, and become a knight of Malta,”
 added Bragelonne, letting fall, one by one, words more icy than the
drops which fall from the bare trees after the tempests of winter. [4]

Under this blow Athos staggered and the prince himself was moved.
Grimaud uttered a heavy groan, and let fall the bottle, which was broken
without anybody paying attention. M. de Beaufort looked the young man in
the face, and read plainly, though his eyes were cast down, the fire of
resolution before which everything must give way. As to Athos, he was
too well acquainted with that tender, but inflexible soul; he could not
hope to make it deviate from the fatal road it had just chosen. He could
only press the hand the duke held out to him. “Comte, I shall set off in
two days for Toulon,” said M. de Beaufort. “Will you meet me at Paris,
in order that I may know your determination?”

“I will have the honor of thanking you there, _mon prince_, for all your
kindness,” replied the comte.

“And be sure to bring the vicomte with you, whether he follows me or
does not follow me,” added the duke; “he has my word, and I only ask
yours.”

Having thrown a little balm upon the wound of the paternal heart, he
pulled the ear of Grimaud, whose eyes sparkled more than usual, and
regained his escort in the parterre. The horses, rested and refreshed,
set off with spirit through the lovely night, and soon placed a
considerable distance between their master and the chateau.

Athos and Bragelonne were again face to face. Eleven o’clock was
striking. The father and son preserved a profound silence towards each
other, where an intelligent observer would have expected cries and
tears. But these two men were of such a nature that all emotion
following their final resolutions plunged itself so deep into their
hearts that it was lost forever. They passed, then, silently and almost
breathlessly, the hour that preceded midnight. The clock, by striking,
alone pointed out to them how many minutes had lasted the painful
journey made by their souls in the immensity of their remembrances of
the past and fear of the future. Athos rose first, saying, “it is late,
then.... Till to-morrow.”

Raoul rose, and in his turn embraced his father. The latter held him
clasped to his breast, and said, in a tremulous voice, “In two days, you
will have left me, my son--left me forever, Raoul!”

“Monsieur,” replied the young man, “I had formed a determination, that
of piercing my heart with my sword; but you would have thought that
cowardly. I have renounced that determination, and _therefore_ we must
part.”

“You leave me desolate by going, Raoul.”

“Listen to me again, monsieur, I implore you. If I do not go, I shall
die here of grief and love. I know how long a time I have to live thus.
Send me away quickly, monsieur, or you will see me basely die before
your eyes--in your house--this is stronger than my will--stronger than
my strength--you may plainly see that within one month I have lived
thirty years, and that I approach the end of my life.”

“Then,” said Athos, coldly, “you go with the intention of getting killed
in Africa? Oh, tell me! do not lie!”

Raoul grew deadly pale, and remained silent for two seconds, which were
to his father two hours of agony. Then, all at once: “Monsieur,” said
he, “I have promised to devote myself to God. In exchange for the
sacrifice I make of my youth and liberty, I will only ask of Him one
thing, and that is, to preserve me for you, because you are the only tie
which attaches me to this world. God alone can give me the strength not
to forget that I owe you everything, and that nothing ought to stand in
my esteem before you.”

Athos embraced his son tenderly, and said:

“You have just replied to me on the word of honor of an honest man; in
two days we shall be with M. de Beaufort at Paris, and you will then do
what will be proper for you to do. You are free, Raoul; adieu.”

And he slowly gained his bedroom. Raoul went down into the garden, and
passed the night in the alley of limes.



Chapter XXVIII. Preparations for Departure.

Athos lost no more time in combating this immutable resolution. He gave
all his attention to preparing, during the two days the duke had granted
him, the proper appointments for Raoul. This labor chiefly concerned
Grimaud, who immediately applied himself to it with the good-will and
intelligence we know he possessed. Athos gave this worthy servant orders
to take the route to Paris when the equipments should be ready; and, not
to expose himself to the danger of keeping the duke waiting, or delaying
Raoul, so that the duke should perceive his absence, he himself, the day
after the visit of M. de Beaufort, set off for Paris with his son.

For the poor young man it was an emotion easily to be understood, thus
to return to Paris amongst all the people who had known and loved him.
Every face recalled a pang to him who had suffered so much; to him who
had loved so much, some circumstance of his unhappy love. Raoul, on
approaching Paris, felt as if he were dying. Once in Paris, he really
existed no longer. When he reached Guiche’s residence, he was informed
that Guiche was with Monsieur. Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg,
and when arrived, without suspecting that he was going to the place
where La Valliere had lived, he heard so much music and respired so
many perfumes, he heard so much joyous laughter, and saw so many dancing
shadows, that if it had not been for a charitable woman, who perceived
him so dejected and pale beneath a doorway, he would have remained there
a few minutes, and then would have gone away, never to return. But, as
we have said, in the first ante-chamber he had stopped, solely for the
sake of not mixing himself with all those happy beings he felt were
moving around him in the adjacent salons. And as one of Monsieur’s
servants, recognizing him, had asked him if he wished to see Monsieur or
Madame, Raoul had scarcely answered him, but had sunk down upon a bench
near the velvet doorway, looking at a clock, which had stopped
for nearly an hour. The servant had passed on, and another, better
acquainted with him, had come up, and interrogated Raoul whether he
should inform M. de Guiche of his being there. This name did not even
arouse the recollections of Raoul. The persistent servant went on to
relate that De Guiche had just invented a new game of lottery, and
was teaching it to the ladies. Raoul, opening his large eyes, like the
absent man in Theophrastus, made no answer, but his sadness increased
two shades. With his head hanging down, his limbs relaxed, his mouth
half open for the escape of his sighs, Raoul remained, thus forgotten,
in the ante-chamber, when all at once a lady’s robe passed, rubbing
against the doors of a side salon, which opened on the gallery. A lady,
young, pretty, and gay, scolding an officer of the household, entered by
that way, and expressed herself with much vivacity. The officer replied
in calm but firm sentences; it was rather a little love pet than a
quarrel of courtiers, and was terminated by a kiss on the fingers of the
lady. Suddenly, on perceiving Raoul, the lady became silent, and pushing
away the officer:

“Make your escape, Malicorne,” said she; “I did not think there was any
one here. I shall curse you, if they have either heard or seen us!”

Malicorne hastened away. The young lady advanced behind Raoul, and
stretching her joyous face over him as he lay:

“Monsieur is a gallant man,” said she, “and no doubt--”

She here interrupted herself by uttering a cry. “Raoul!” said she,
blushing.

“Mademoiselle de Montalais!” said Raoul, paler than death.

He rose unsteadily, and tried to make his way across the slippery mosaic
of the floor; but she had comprehended that savage and cruel grief; she
felt that in the flight of Raoul there was an accusation of herself. A
woman, ever vigilant, she did not think she ought to let the opportunity
slip of making good her justification; but Raoul, though stopped by her
in the middle of the gallery, did not seem disposed to surrender without
a combat. He took it up in a tone so cold and embarrassed, that if they
had been thus surprised, the whole court would have no doubt about the
proceedings of Mademoiselle de Montalais.

“Ah! monsieur,” said she with disdain, “what you are doing is very
unworthy of a gentleman. My heart inclines me to speak to you; you
compromise me by a reception almost uncivil; you are wrong, monsieur;
and you confound your friends with enemies. Farewell!”

Raoul had sworn never to speak of Louise, never even to look at those
who might have seen Louise; he was going into another world, that he
might never meet with anything Louise had seen, or even touched. But
after the first shock of his pride, after having had a glimpse of
Montalais, the companion of Louise--Montalais, who reminded him of the
turret of Blois and the joys of youth--all his reason faded away.

“Pardon me, mademoiselle; it enters not, it cannot enter into my
thoughts to be uncivil.”

“Do you wish to speak to me?” said she, with the smile of former days.
“Well! come somewhere else; for we may be surprised.”

“Oh!” said he.

She looked at the clock, doubtingly, then, having reflected:

“In my apartment,” said she, “we shall have an hour to ourselves.” And
taking her course, lighter than a fairy, she ran up to her chamber,
followed by Raoul. Shutting the door, and placing in the hands of her
_cameriste_ the mantle she had held upon her arm:

“You were seeking M. de Guiche, were you not?” said she to Raoul.

“Yes, mademoiselle.”

“I will go and ask him to come up here, presently, after I have spoken
to you.”

“Do so, mademoiselle.”

“Are you angry with me?”

Raoul looked at her for a moment, then, casting down his eyes, “Yes,”
 said he.

“You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture,
do you not?”

“Rupture!” said he, with bitterness. “Oh! mademoiselle, there can be no
rupture where there has been no love.”

“You are in error,” replied Montalais; “Louise did love you.”

Raoul started.

“Not with love, I know; but she liked you, and you ought to have married
her before you set out for London.”

Raoul broke into a sinister laugh, which made Montalais shudder.

“You tell me that very much at your ease, mademoiselle. Do people marry
whom they like? You forget that the king then kept for himself as his
mistress her of whom we are speaking.”

“Listen,” said the young woman, pressing the hands of Raoul in her own,
“you were wrong in every way; a man of your age ought never to leave a
woman of hers alone.”

“There is no longer any faith in the world, then,” said Raoul.

“No, vicomte,” said Montalais, quietly. “Nevertheless, let me tell you
that, if, instead of loving Louise coldly and philosophically, you had
endeavored to awaken her to love--”

“Enough, I pray you, mademoiselle,” said Raoul. “I feel as though you
are all, of both sexes, of a different age from me. You can laugh, and
you can banter agreeably. I, mademoiselle, I loved Mademoiselle de--”
 Raoul could not pronounce her name,--“I loved her well! I put my faith
in her--now I am quits by loving her no longer.”

“Oh, vicomte!” said Montalais, pointing to his reflection in a
looking-glass.

“I know what you mean, mademoiselle; I am much altered, am I not? Well!
Do you know why? Because my face is the mirror of my heart, the outer
surface changed to match the mind within.”

“You are consoled, then?” said Montalais, sharply.

“No, I shall never be consoled.”

“I don’t understand you, M. de Bragelonne.”

“I care but little for that. I do not quite understand myself.”

“You have not even tried to speak to Louise?”

“Who! I?” exclaimed the young man, with eyes flashing fire; “I!--Why do
you not advise me to marry her? Perhaps the king would consent now.” And
he rose from his chair full of anger.

“I see,” said Montalais, “that you are not cured, and that Louise has
one enemy the more.”

“One enemy the more!”

“Yes; favorites are but little beloved at the court of France.”

“Oh! while she has her lover to protect her, is not that enough? She
has chosen him of such a quality that her enemies cannot prevail against
her.” But, stopping all at once, “And then she has you for a friend,
mademoiselle,” added he, with a shade of irony which did not glide off
the cuirass.

“Who! I?--Oh, no! I am no longer one of those whom Mademoiselle de la
Valliere condescends to look upon; but--”

This _but_, so big with menace and with storm; this _but_, which made
the heart of Raoul beat, such griefs did it presage for her whom lately
he loved so dearly; this terrible _but_, so significant in a woman
like Montalais, was interrupted by a moderately loud noise heard by the
speakers proceeding from the alcove behind the wainscoting. Montalais
turned to listen, and Raoul was already rising, when a lady entered the
room quietly by the secret door, which she closed after her.

“Madame!” exclaimed Raoul, on recognizing the sister-in-law of the king.

“Stupid wretch!” murmured Montalais, throwing herself, but too late,
before the princess, “I have been mistaken in an hour!” She had,
however, time to warn the princess, who was walking towards Raoul.

“M. de Bragelonne, Madame,” and at these words the princess drew back,
uttering a cry in her turn.

“Your royal highness,” said Montalais, with volubility, “is kind enough
to think of this lottery, and--”

The princess began to lose countenance. Raoul hastened his departure,
without divining all, but he felt that he was in the way. Madame was
preparing a word of transition to recover herself, when a closet opened
in front of the alcove, and M. de Guiche issued, all radiant, also from
that closet. The palest of the four, we must admit, was still Raoul. The
princess, however, was near fainting, and was obliged to lean upon the
foot of the bed for support. No one ventured to support her. This scene
occupied several minutes of terrible suspense. But Raoul broke it.
He went up to the count, whose inexpressible emotion made his knees
tremble, and taking his hand, “Dear count,” said he, “tell Madame I am
too unhappy not to merit pardon; tell her also that I have loved in the
course of my life, and that the horror of the treachery that has been
practiced on me renders me inexorable towards all other treachery that
may be committed around me. This is why, mademoiselle,” said he, smiling
to Montalais, “I never would divulge the secret of the visits of my
friend to your apartment. Obtain from Madame--from Madame, who is so
clement and so generous,--obtain her pardon for you whom she has just
surprised also. You are both free, love each other, be happy!”

The princess felt for a moment a despair that cannot be described; it
was repugnant to her, notwithstanding the exquisite delicacy which Raoul
had exhibited, to feel herself at the mercy of one who had discovered
such an indiscretion. It was equally repugnant to her to accept the
evasion offered by this delicate deception. Agitated, nervous, she
struggled against the double stings of these two troubles. Raoul
comprehended her position, and came once more to her aid. Bending his
knee before her: “Madame!” said he, in a low voice, “in two days I shall
be far from Paris; in a fortnight I shall be far from France, where I
shall never be seen again.”

“Are you going away, then?” said she, with great delight.

“With M. de Beaufort.”

“Into Africa!” cried De Guiche, in his turn. “You, Raoul--oh! my
friend--into Africa, where everybody dies!”

And forgetting everything, forgetting that that forgetfulness itself
compromised the princess more eloquently than his presence, “Ingrate!”
 said he, “and you have not even consulted me!” And he embraced him;
during which time Montalais had led away Madame, and disappeared
herself.

Raoul passed his hand over his brow, and said, with a smile, “I have
been dreaming!” Then warmly to Guiche, who by degrees absorbed him, “My
friend,” said he, “I conceal nothing from you, who are the elected of my
heart. I am going to seek death in yonder country; your secret will not
remain in my breast more than a year.”

“Oh, Raoul! a man!”

“Do you know what is my thought, count? This is it--I shall live more
vividly, being buried beneath the earth, than I have lived for this
month past. We are Christians, my friend, and if such sufferings were to
continue, I would not be answerable for the safety of my soul.”

De Guiche was anxious to raise objections.

“Not one word more on my account,” said Raoul; “but advice to you, dear
friend; what I am going to say to you is of much greater importance.”

“What is that?”

“Without doubt you risk much more than I do, because you love.”

“Oh!”

“It is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus! Well, then,
De Guiche, beware of Montalais.”

“What! of that kind friend?”

“She was the friend of--her you know of. She ruined her by pride.”

“You are mistaken.”

“And now, when she has ruined her, she would ravish from her the only
thing that renders that woman excusable in my eyes.”

“What is that?”

“Her love.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“I mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of
the king--a plot formed in the very house of Madame.”

“Can you think so?”

“I am certain of it.”

“By Montalais?”

“Take her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for--the other!”

“Explain yourself clearly, my friend; and if I can understand you--”

“In two words. Madame has been long jealous of the king.”

“I know she has--”

“Oh! fear nothing--you are beloved--you are beloved, count; do you feel
the value of these three words? They signify that you can raise your
head, that you can sleep tranquilly, that you can thank God every
minute of you life. You are beloved; that signifies that you may hear
everything, even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your
happiness. You are beloved, De Guiche, you are beloved! You do not
endure those atrocious nights, those nights without end, which, with
arid eye and fainting heart, others pass through who are destined to
die. You will live long, if you act like the miser who, bit by bit,
crumb by crumb, collects and heaps up diamonds and gold. You are
beloved!--allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved
forever.”

De Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man, half
mad with despair, till there passed through his heart something like
remorse at his own happiness. Raoul suppressed his feverish excitement,
to assume the voice and countenance of an impassible man.

“They will make her, whose name I should wish still to be able to
pronounce--they will make her suffer. Swear to me that you will not
second them in anything--but that you will defend her when possible, as
I would have done myself.”

“I swear I will,” replied De Guiche.

“And,” continued Raoul, “some day, when you shall have rendered her
a great service--some day when she shall thank you, promise me to say
these words to her--‘I have done you this kindness, madame, at the warm
request of M. de Bragelonne, whom you so deeply injured.’”

“I swear I will,” murmured De Guiche.

“That is all. Adieu! I set out to-morrow, or the day after, for
Toulon. If you have a few hours to spare, give them to me.”

“All! all!” cried the young man.

“Thank you!”

“And what are you going to do now?”

“I am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet’s residence, where we hope
to find M. d’Artagnan.”

“M. d’Artagnan?”

“Yes, I wish to embrace him before my departure. He is a brave man, who
loves me dearly. Farewell, my friend; you are expected, no doubt; you
will find me, when you wish, at the lodgings of the comte. Farewell!”

The two young men embraced. Those who chanced to see them both thus,
would not have hesitated to say, pointing to Raoul, “That is the happy
man!”



Chapter XXIX. Planchet’s Inventory.

Athos, during the visit made to the Luxembourg by Raoul, had gone to
Planchet’s residence to inquire after D’Artagnan. The comte, on
arriving at the Rue des Lombards, found the shop of the grocer in great
confusion; but it was not the encumberment of a lucky sale, or that of
an arrival of goods. Planchet was not enthroned, as usual, on sacks and
barrels. No. A young man with a pen behind his ear, and another with an
account-book in his hand, were setting down a number of figures, whilst
a third counted and weighed. An inventory was being taken. Athos,
who had no knowledge of commercial matters, felt himself a little
embarrassed by material obstacles and the majesty of those who were thus
employed. He saw several customers sent away, and asked himself
whether he, who came to buy nothing, would not be more properly deemed
importunate. He therefore asked very politely if he could see M.
Planchet. The reply, quite carelessly given, was that M. Planchet was
packing his trunks. These words surprised Athos. “What! his trunks?”
 said he; “is M. Planchet going away?”

“Yes, monsieur, directly.”

“Then, if you please, inform him that M. le Comte de la Fere desires to
speak to him for a moment.”

At the mention of the comte’s name, one of the young men, no doubt
accustomed to hear it pronounced with respect, immediately went to
inform Planchet. It was at this moment that Raoul, after his painful
scene with Montalais and De Guiche, arrived at the grocer’s house.
Planchet left his job directly he received the comte’s message.

“Ah! monsieur le comte!” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! What
good star brings you here?”

“My dear Planchet,” said Athos, pressing the hand of his son, whose sad
look he silently observed,--“we are come to learn of you--But in what
confusion do I find you! You are as white as a miller; where have you
been rummaging?”

“Ah, _diable!_ take care, monsieur; don’t come near me till I have well
shaken myself.”

“What for? Flour or dust only whiten.”

“No, no; what you see on my arms is arsenic.”

“Arsenic?”

“Yes; I am taking my precautions against rats.”

“Ay, I suppose in an establishment like this, rats play a conspicuous
part.”

“It is not with this establishment I concern myself, monsieur le comte.
The rats have robbed me of more here than they will ever rob me of
again.”

“What do you mean?”

“Why, you may have observed, monsieur, my inventory is being taken.”

“Are you leaving trade, then?”

“Eh! _mon Dieu!_ yes. I have disposed of my business to one of my young
men.”

“Bah! you are rich, then, I suppose?”

“Monsieur, I have taken a dislike to the city; I don’t know whether it
is because I am growing old, and as M. d’Artagnan one day said, when
we grow old we more often think of the adventures of our youth; but
for some time past I have felt myself attracted towards the country
and gardening. I was a countryman formerly.” And Planchet marked this
confession with a rather pretentious laugh for a man making profession
of humility.

Athos made a gesture of approval, and then added: “You are going to buy
an estate, then?”

“I have bought one, monsieur.”

“Ah! that is still better.”

“A little house at Fontainebleau, with something like twenty acres of
land round it.”

“Very well, Planchet! Accept my compliments on your acquisition.”

“But, monsieur, we are not comfortable here; the cursed dust makes you
cough. _Corbleu!_ I do not wish to poison the most worthy gentleman in
the kingdom.”

Athos did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed
at him, in order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness.

“Yes,” said Athos, “let us have a little talk by ourselves--in your own
room, for example. You have a room, have you not?”

“Certainly, monsieur le comte.”

“Upstairs, perhaps?” And Athos, seeing Planchet a little embarrassed,
wished to relieve him by going first.

“It is--but--” said Planchet, hesitating.

Athos was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation, and, attributing it
to a fear the grocer might have of offering humble hospitality, “Never
mind, never mind,” said he, still going up, “the dwelling of a tradesman
in this quarter is not expected to be a palace. Come on.”

Raoul nimbly preceded him, and entered first. Two cries were heard
simultaneously--we may say three. One of these cries dominated the
others; it emanated from a woman. Another proceeded from the mouth of
Raoul; it was an exclamation of surprise. He had no sooner uttered it
than he shut the door sharply. The third was from fright; it came from
Planchet.

“I ask your pardon!” added he; “madame is dressing.”

Raoul had, no doubt, seen that what Planchet said was true, for he
turned round to go downstairs again.

“Madame--” said Athos. “Oh! pardon me, Planchet, I did not know that you
had upstairs--”

“It is Truchen,” added Planchet, blushing a little.

“It is whoever you please, my good Planchet; but pardon my rudeness.”

“No, no; go up now, gentlemen.”

“We will do no such thing,” said Athos.

“Oh! madame, having notice, has had time--”

“No, Planchet; farewell!”

“Eh, gentlemen! you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the
staircase, or by going away without having sat down.”

“If we had known you had a lady upstairs,” replied Athos, with his
customary coolness, “we would have asked permission to pay our respects
to her.”

Planchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance, that he forced
the passage, and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son.
Truchen was quite dressed: in the costume of the shopkeeper’s wife,
rich yet coquettish; German eyes attacking French eyes. She left the
apartment after two courtesies, and went down into the shop--but not
without having listened at the door, to know what Planchet’s gentlemen
visitors would say of her. Athos suspected that, and therefore turned
the conversation accordingly. Planchet, on his part, was burning to
give explanations, which Athos avoided. But, as certain tenacities are
stronger than others, Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls
of felicity, translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus.
So Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing
age, and brought good luck to his business, as Ruth did to Boaz.

“You want nothing now, then, but heirs to your property.”

“If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres,” said
Planchet.

“Humph! you must have one, then,” said Athos, phlegmatically, “if only
to prevent your little fortune being lost.”

This word _little fortune_ placed Planchet in his rank, like the voice
of the sergeant when Planchet was but a _piqueur_ in the regiment of
Piedmont, in which Rochefort had placed him. Athos perceived that the
grocer would marry Truchen, and, in spite of fate, establish a family.
This appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the young man
to whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin. Having heard
all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer,
“What is M. d’Artagnan about?” said he; “he is not at the Louvre.”

“Ah! monsieur le comte, Monsieur d’Artagnan has disappeared.”

“Disappeared!” said Athos, in surprise.

“Oh! monsieur, we know what that means.”

“But _I_ do not know.”

“Whenever M. d’Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some
great affair.”

“Has he said anything to you about it?”

“Never.”

“You were acquainted with his departure for England formerly, were you
not?”

“On account of the speculation.” said Planchet, heedlessly.

“The speculation!”

“I mean--” interrupted Planchet, quite confused.

“Well, well; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in
question; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to
you. Since the captain of the musketeers is not here, and as we cannot
learn from you where we are likely to find M. d’Artagnan, we will take
our leave of you. _Au revoir_, Planchet, _au revoir_. Let us be gone,
Raoul.”

“Monsieur le comte, I wish I were able to tell you--”

“Oh, not at all; I am not the man to reproach a servant with
discretion.”

This word “servant” struck rudely on the ears of the _demi-millionnaire_
Planchet, but natural respect and _bonhomie_ prevailed over pride.
“There is nothing indiscreet in telling you, monsieur le comte, M.
d’Artagnan came here the other day--”

“Aha?”

“And remained several hours consulting a geographical chart.”

“You are right, then, my friend; say no more about it.”

“And the chart is there as a proof,” added Planchet, who went to fetch
from the neighboring wall, where it was suspended by a twist, forming a
triangle with the bar of the window to which it was fastened, the plan
consulted by the captain on his last visit to Planchet. This plan, which
he brought to the comte, was a map of France, upon which the practiced
eye of that gentleman discovered an itinerary, marked out with small
pins; wherever a pin was missing, a hole denoted its having been there.
Athos, by following with his eye the pins and holes, saw that
D’Artagnan had taken the direction of the south, and gone as far as the
Mediterranean, towards Toulon. It was near Cannes that the marks and
the punctured places ceased. The Comte de la Fere puzzled his brains for
some time, to divine what the musketeer could be going to do at Cannes,
and what motive could have led him to examine the banks of the Var. The
reflections of Athos suggested nothing. His accustomed perspicacity was
at fault. Raoul’s researches were not more successful than his father’s.

“Never mind,” said the young man to the comte, who silently, and with
his finger, had made him understand the route of D’Artagnan; “we must
confess that there is a Providence always occupied in connecting our
destiny with that of M. d’Artagnan. There he is on the coast of Cannes,
and you, monsieur, will, at least, conduct me as far as Toulon. Be
assured that we shall meet with him more easily upon our route than on
this map.”

Then, taking leave of Planchet, who was scolding his shopmen, even the
cousin of Truchen, his successor, the gentlemen set out to pay a visit
to M. de Beaufort. On leaving the grocer’s shop, they saw a coach, the
future depository of the charms of Mademoiselle Truchen and Planchet’s
bags of crowns.

“Every one journeys towards happiness by the route he chooses,” said
Raoul, in a melancholy tone.

“Road to Fontainebleau!” cried Planchet to his coachman.



Chapter XXX. The Inventory of M. de Beaufort.

To have talked of D’Artagnan with Planchet, to have seen Planchet quit
Paris to bury himself in his country retreat, had been for Athos and his
son like a last farewell to the noise of the capital--to their life of
former days. What, in fact, did these men leave behind them--one of whom
had exhausted the past age in glory, and the other, the present age
in misfortune? Evidently neither of them had anything to ask of his
contemporaries. They had only to pay a visit to M. de Beaufort, and
arrange with him the particulars of departure. The duke was lodged
magnificently in Paris. He had one of those superb establishments
pertaining to great fortunes, the like of which certain old men
remembered to have seen in all their glory in the times of wasteful
liberality of Henry III.’s reign. Then, really, several great nobles
were richer than the king. They knew it, used it, and never deprived
themselves of the pleasure of humiliating his royal majesty when they
had an opportunity. It was this egotistical aristocracy Richelieu had
constrained to contribute, with its blood, its purse, and its duties, to
what was from his time styled the king’s service. From Louis XI.--that
terrible mower-down of the great--to Richelieu, how many families had
raised their heads! How many, from Richelieu to Louis XIV., had bowed
their heads, never to raise them again! But M. de Beaufort was born a
prince, and of a blood which is not shed upon scaffolds, unless by the
decree of peoples,--a prince who had kept up a grand style of living.
How did he maintain his horses, his people, and his table? Nobody knew;
himself less than others. Only there were then privileges for the sons
of kings, to whom nobody refused to become a creditor, whether from
respect or the persuasion that they would some day be paid.

Athos and Raoul found the mansion of the duke in as much confusion as
that of Planchet. The duke, likewise, was making his inventory; that is
to say, he was distributing to his friends everything of value he had
in his house. Owing nearly two millions--an enormous amount in those
days--M. de Beaufort had calculated that he could not set out for
Africa without a good round sum, and, in order to find that sum, he was
distributing to his old creditors plate, arms, jewels, and furniture,
which was more magnificent in selling it, and brought him back double.
In fact, how could a man to whom ten thousand livres were owing, refuse
to carry away a present worth six thousand, enhanced in estimation from
having belonged to a descendant of Henry IV.? And how, after having
carried away that present, could he refuse ten thousand livres more to
this generous noble? This, then, was what had happened. The duke had
no longer a dwelling-house--that had become useless to an admiral whose
place of residence is his ship; he had no longer need of superfluous
arms, when he was placed amidst his cannons; no more jewels, which the
sea might rob him of; but he had three or four hundred thousand crowns
fresh in his coffers. And throughout the house there was a joyous
movement of people who believed they were plundering monseigneur. The
prince had, in a supreme degree, the art of making happy the creditors
most to be pitied. Every distressed man, every empty purse, found in him
patience and sympathy for his position. To some he said, “I wish I had
what _you_ have; I would give it you.” And to others, “I have but this
silver ewer; it is worth at least five hundred livres,--take it.” The
effect of which was--so truly is courtesy a current payment--that the
prince constantly found means to renew his creditors. This time he
used no ceremony; it might be called a general pillage. He gave up
everything. The Oriental fable of the poor Arab who carried away from
the pillage of palace a kettle at the bottom of which was concealed a
bag of gold, and whom everybody allowed to pass without jealousy,--this
fable had become a truth in the prince’s mansion. Many contractors paid
themselves upon the offices of the duke. Thus, the provision department,
who plundered the clothes-presses and the harness-rooms, attached very
little value to things which tailors and saddlers set great store by.
Anxious to carry home to their wives presents given them by monseigneur,
many were seen bounding joyously along, under the weight of earthen
jars and bottles, gloriously stamped with the arms of the prince. M. de
Beaufort finished by giving away his horses and the hay from his lofts.
He made more than thirty happy with kitchen utensils; and thirty more
with the contents of his cellar. Still further; all these people went
away with the conviction that M. de Beaufort only acted in this manner
to prepare for a new fortune concealed beneath the Arabs’ tents. They
repeated to each other, while pillaging his hotel, that he was sent to
Gigelli by the king to reconstruct his lost fortunes; that the treasures
of Africa would be equally divided between the admiral and the king of
France; that these treasures consisted in mines of diamonds, or other
fabulous stones; the gold and silver mines of Mount Atlas did not
even obtain the honor of being named. In addition to the mines to be
worked--which could not be begun till after the campaign--there would
be the booty made by the army. M. de Beaufort would lay his hands on
all the riches pirates had robbed Christendom of since the battle of
Lepanto. The number of millions from these sources defied calculation.
Why, then, should he, who was going in quest of such treasure, set
any store by the poor utensils of his past life? And reciprocally, why
should they spare the property of him who spared it so little himself?

Such was the position of affairs. Athos, with his piercing practiced
glance, saw what was going on at once. He found the admiral of France a
little exalted, for he was rising from a table of fifty covers, at
which the guests had drunk long and deeply to the prosperity of the
expedition; at the conclusion of which repast, the remains, with the
dessert, had been given to the servants, and the empty dishes and
plates to the curious. The prince was intoxicated with his ruin and his
popularity at one and the same time. He had drunk his old wine to the
health of his wine of the future. When he saw Athos and Raoul:

“There is my aide-de-camp being brought to me!” he cried. “Come hither,
comte; come hither, vicomte.”

Athos tried to find a passage through the heaps of linen and plate.

“Ah! step over, step over!” said the duke, offering a full glass to
Athos. The latter drank it; Raoul scarcely moistened his lips.

“Here is your commission,” said the prince to Raoul. “I had prepared it,
reckoning upon you. You will go before me as far as Antibes.”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“Here is the order.” And De Beaufort gave Raoul the order. “Do you know
anything of the sea?”

“Yes, monseigneur; I have traveled with M. le Prince.”

“That is well. All these barges and lighters must be in attendance to
form an escort and carry my provisions. The army must be prepared to
embark in a fortnight at the very latest.”

“That shall be done, monseigneur.”

“The present order gives you the right to visit and search all the isles
along the coast; you will there make the enrolments and levies you may
want for me.”

“Yes, monsieur le duc.”

“And you are an active man, and will work freely, you will spend much
money.”

“I hope not, monseigneur.”

“But I am sure you will. My intendant has prepared the orders of a
thousand livres, drawn upon the cities of the south; he will give you a
hundred of them. Now, dear vicomte, be gone.”

Athos interrupted the prince. “Keep your money, monseigneur; war is to
be waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead.”

“I wish to try the contrary,” replied the duke; “and then you are
acquainted with my ideas upon the expedition--plenty of noise, plenty
of fire, and, if so it must be, I shall disappear in the smoke.” Having
spoken thus, M. de Beaufort began to laugh; but his mirth was not
reciprocated by Athos and Raoul. He perceived this at once. “Ah,” said
he, with the courteous egotism of his rank and age, “you are such people
as a man should not see after dinner; you are cold, stiff, and dry when
I am all fire, suppleness, and wine. No, devil take me! I should always
see you fasting, vicomte, and you, comte, if you wear such a face as
that, you shall see me no more.”

He said this, pressing the hand of Athos, who replied with a smile,
“Monseigneur, do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty
of money. I predict that within a month you will be dry, stiff, and
cold, in presence of your strong-box, and that then, having Raoul at
your elbow, fasting, you will be surprised to see him gay, animated, and
generous, because he will have some new crowns to offer you.”

“God grant it may be so!” cried the delighted duke. “Comte, stay with
me!”

“No, I shall go with Raoul; the mission with which you charge him is
a troublesome and difficult one. Alone it would be too much for him to
execute. You do not observe, monseigneur, you have given him command of
the first order.”

“Bah!”

“And in your naval arrangements, too.”

“That may be true. But one finds that such fine young fellows as your
son generally do all that is required of them.”

“Monseigneur, I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and
intelligence, so much real bravery, as in Raoul; but if he failed
to arrange your embarkation, you would only meet the fate that you
deserve.”

“Humph! you are scolding me, then.”

“Monseigneur, to provision a fleet, to assemble a flotilla, to enroll
your maritime force, would take an admiral a year. Raoul is a cavalry
officer, and you allow him a fortnight!”

“I tell you he will do it.”

“He may; but I will go and help him.”

“To be sure you will; I reckoned upon you, and still further believe
that when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone.”

“Oh!” said Athos, shaking his head.

“Patience! patience!”

“Monseigneur, permit us to take our leave.”

“Begone, then, and may my good luck attend you.”

“Adieu! monseigneur; and may your own good luck attend you likewise.”

“Here is an expedition admirably commenced!” said Athos to his son. “No
provisions--no store flotilla! What can be done, thus?”

“Humph!” murmured Raoul; “if all are going to do as I am, provisions
will not be wanted.”

“Monsieur,” replied Athos, sternly, “do not be unjust and senseless in
your egotism, or your grief, whichever you please to call it. If you set
out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein,
you stand in need of nobody, and it was scarcely worth while to
recommend you to M. de Beaufort. But when you have been introduced to
the prime commandant--when you have accepted the responsibility of a
post in his army, the question is no longer about _you_, but about all
those poor soldiers, who, as well as you, have hearts and bodies, who
will weep for their country and endure all the necessities of their
condition. Remember, Raoul, that officers are ministers as useful to the
world as priests, and that they ought to have more charity.”

“Monsieur, I know it and have practiced it; I would have continued to do
so still, but--”

“You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military
glory; go and die if you like, but do not die without honor and without
advantage to France. Cheer up, Raoul! do not let my words grieve you; I
love you, and wish to see you perfect.”

“I love your reproaches, monsieur,” said the young man, mildly; “they
alone may cure me, because they prove to me that some one loves me
still.”

“And now, Raoul, let us be off; the weather is so fine, the heavens so
clear, those heavens which we always find above our heads, which you
will see more clear still at Gigelli, and which will speak to you of me
there, as they speak to me here of God.”

The two gentlemen, after having agreed on this point, talked over the
wild freaks of the duke, convinced that France would be served in a very
incomplete manner, as regarded both spirit and practice, in the ensuing
expedition; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word
vanity, they set forward, in obedience rather to their will than
destiny. The sacrifice was half accomplished.



Chapter XXXI. The Silver Dish.

The journey passed off pretty well. Athos and his son traversed France
at the rate of fifteen leagues per day; sometimes more, sometimes less,
according to the intensity of Raoul’s grief. It took them a fortnight
to reach Toulon, and they lost all traces of D’Artagnan at Antibes. They
were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous
of preserving an incognito on his route, for Athos derived from
his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had
exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon.
Raoul was much affected at not meeting with D’Artagnan. His affectionate
heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart
of steel. Athos knew from experience that D’Artagnan became impenetrable
when engaged in any serious affair, whether on his own account or on the
service of the king. He even feared to offend his friend, or thwart him
by too pressing inquiries. And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of
classing the flotilla, and got together the _chalands_ and lighters to
send them to Toulon, one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat
had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a
gentleman who was in great haste to embark. Athos, believing that this
man was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish,
and so gain more money when all his companions were gone, insisted upon
having the details. The fisherman informed him that six days previously,
a man had come in the night to hire his boat, for the purpose of
visiting the island of St. Honnorat. The price was agreed upon, but the
gentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case, which he insisted
upon embarking, in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the
operation. The fisherman wished to retract. He had even threatened,
but his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the
gentleman’s cane, which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long. Swearing
and grumbling, he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at
Antibes, who administer justice among themselves and protect each other;
but the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper, at sight of which
the syndic, bowing to the very ground, enjoined obedience from the
fisherman, and abused him for having been refractory. They then departed
with the freight.

“But all this does not tell us,” said Athos, “how you injured your
boat.”

“This is the way. I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman
desired me; but he changed his mind, and pretended that I could not pass
to the south of the abbey.”

“And why not?”

“Because, monsieur, there is in front of the square tower of the
Benedictines, towards the southern point, the bank of the _Moines_.”

“A rock?” asked Athos.

“Level with the water, but below water; a dangerous passage, yet one I
have cleared a thousand times; the gentleman required me to land him at
Sainte-Marguerite’s.”

“Well?”

“Well, monsieur!” cried the fisherman, with his _Provencal_ accent, “a
man is a sailor, or he is not; he knows his course, or he is nothing but
a fresh-water lubber. I was obstinate, and wished to try the channel.
The gentleman took me by the collar, and told me quietly he would
strangle me. My mate armed himself with a hatchet, and so did I. We had
the affront of the night before to pay him out for. But the gentleman
drew his sword, and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner, that
we neither of us could get near him. I was about to hurl my hatchet at
his head, and I had a right to do so, hadn’t I, monsieur? for a sailor
aboard is master, as a citizen is in his chamber; I was going, then, in
self-defense, to cut the gentleman in two, when, all at once--believe me
or not, monsieur--the great carriage case opened of itself, I don’t know
how, and there came out of it a sort of a phantom, his head covered with
a black helmet and a black mask, something terrible to look upon, which
came towards me threatening with its fist.”

“And that was--” said Athos.

“That was the devil, monsieur; for the gentleman, with great glee, cried
out, on seeing him: ‘Ah! thank you, monseigneur!’”

“A most strange story!” murmured the comte, looking at Raoul.

“And what did you do?” asked the latter of the fisherman.

“You must know, monsieur, that two poor men, such as we are, could be
no match for two gentlemen; but when one of them turned out to be the
devil, we had no earthly chance! My companion and I did not stop to
consult one another; we made but one jump into the sea, for we were
within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore.”

“Well, and then?”

“Why, and then, monseigneur, as there was a little wind from the
southwest, the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite’s.”

“Oh!--but the travelers?”

“Bah! you need not be uneasy about them! It was pretty plain that one
was the devil, and protected the other; for when we recovered the boat,
after she got afloat again, instead of finding these two creatures
injured by the shock, we found nothing, not even the carriage or the
case.”

“Very strange! very strange!” repeated the comte. “But after that, what
did you do, my friend?”

“I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite’s, who brought
my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly
stories he would have me flogged.”

“What! did the governor himself say so?”

“Yes, monsieur; and yet my boat was injured, seriously injured, for the
prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite’s, and the carpenter
asks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it.”

“Very well,” replied Raoul; “you will be exempted from the service. Go.”

“We will go to Sainte-Marguerite’s, shall we?” said the comte to
Bragelonne, as the man walked away.

“Yes, monsieur, for there is something to be cleared up; that man does
not seem to me to have told the truth.”

“Nor to me either, Raoul. The story of the masked man and the carriage
having disappeared, may be told to conceal some violence these fellows
have committed upon their passengers in the open sea, to punish him for
his persistence in embarking.”

“I formed the same suspicion; the carriage was more likely to contain
property than a man.”

“We shall see to that, Raoul. The gentleman very much resembles
D’Artagnan; I recognize his methods of proceeding. Alas! we are no
longer the young invincibles of former days. Who knows whether the
hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in
doing that which the best blades of Europe, balls, and bullets have not
been able to do in forty years?”

That same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite’s, on board a
_chasse-maree_ come from Toulon under orders. The impression they
experienced on landing was a singularly pleasing one. The island seemed
loaded with flowers and fruits. In its cultivated part it served as a
garden for the governor. Orange, pomegranate, and fig trees bent beneath
the weight of their golden or purple fruits. All round this garden, in
the uncultivated parts, red partridges ran about in conveys among the
brambles and tufts of junipers, and at every step of the comte and Raoul
a terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to scuttle away to the
burrow. In fact, this fortunate isle was uninhabited. Flat, offering
nothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation, and under the
protection of the governor, who went shares with them, smugglers made
use of it as a provisional _entrepot_, at the expense of not killing the
game or devastating the garden. With this compromise, the governor was
in a situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his
fortress, in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green. The
governor was a sort of happy farmer, harvesting wines, figs, oil,
and oranges, preserving his citrons and _cedrates_ in the sun of his
casemates. The fortress, encircled by a deep ditch, its only guardian,
arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by
terraces covered with moss.

Athos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden
without finding any one to introduce them to the governor. They ended by
making their own way into the garden. It was at the hottest time of
the day. Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone. The
heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises, to envelop
all existences; the rabbit under the broom, the fly under the leaf,
slept as the wave did beneath the heavens. Athos saw nothing living but
a soldier, upon the terrace beneath the second and third court, who was
carrying a basket of provisions on his head. This man returned almost
immediately without his basket, and disappeared in the shade of his
sentry-box. Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some
one, and, after having done so, returned to dine himself. All at once
they heard some one call out, and raising their heads, perceived in the
frame of the bars of the window something of a white color, like a
hand that was waved backwards and forwards--something shining, like a
polished weapon struck by the rays of the sun. And before they were able
to ascertain what it was, a luminous train, accompanied by a hissing
sound in the air, called their attention from the donjon to the ground.
A second dull noise was heard from the ditch, and Raoul ran to pick up
a silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand. The hand that
had thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen, and then
disappeared. Athos and Raoul, approaching each other, commenced an
attentive examination of the dusty plate, and they discovered, in
characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife, this
inscription:

“_I am the brother of the king of France--a prisoner to-day--a madman
to-morrow. French gentlemen and Christians, pray to God for the soul and
the reason of the son of your old rulers_.”

The plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring
to make out the meaning of these dismal words. At the same moment they
heard a cry from the top of the donjon. Quick as lightning Raoul
bent down his head, and forced down that of his father likewise. A
musket-barrel glittered from the crest of the wall. A white smoke
floated like a plume from the mouth of the musket, and a ball was
flattened against a stone within six inches of the two gentlemen.

“_Cordieu!_” cried Athos. “What, are people assassinated here? Come
down, cowards as you are!”

“Yes, come down!” cried Raoul, furiously shaking his fist at the castle.

One of the assailants--he who was about to fire--replied to these cries
by an exclamation of surprise; and, as his companion, who wished to
continue the attack, had re-seized his loaded musket, he who had cried
out threw up the weapon, and the ball flew into the air. Athos and
Raoul, seeing them disappear from the platform, expected they would
come down to them, and waited with a firm demeanor. Five minutes had
not elapsed, when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the
garrison to arms, and they showed themselves on the other side of
the ditch with their muskets in hand. At the head of these men was an
officer, whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the
first musket. The man ordered the soldiers to “make ready.”

“We are going to be shot!” cried Raoul; “but, sword in hand, at least,
let us leap the ditch! We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels,
when their muskets are empty.” And, suiting the action to the word,
Raoul was springing forward, followed by Athos, when a well-known voice
resounded behind them, “Athos! Raoul!”

“D’Artagnan!” replied the two gentlemen.

“Recover arms! _Mordioux!_” cried the captain to the soldiers. “I was
sure I could not be mistaken!”

“What is the meaning of this?” asked Athos. “What! were we to be shot
without warning?”

“It was I who was going to shoot you, and if the governor missed you, I
should not have missed you, my dear friends. How fortunate it is that
I am accustomed to take a long aim, instead of firing at the instant I
raise my weapon! I thought I recognized you. Ah! my dear friends, how
fortunate!” And D’Artagnan wiped his brow, for he had run fast, and
emotion with him was not feigned.

“How!” said Athos. “And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of
the fortress?”

“In person.”

“And why did he fire at us? What have we done to him?”

“_Pardieu!_ You received what the prisoner threw to you?”

“That is true.”

“That plate--the prisoner has written something on it, has he not?”

“Yes.”

“Good heavens! I was afraid he had.”

And D’Artagnan, with all the marks of mortal disquietude, seized the
plate, to read the inscription. When he had read it, a fearful pallor
spread across his countenance. “Oh! good heavens!” repeated he.
“Silence!--Here is the governor.”

“And what will he do to us? Is it our fault?”

“It is true, then?” said Athos, in a subdued voice. “It is true?”

“Silence! I tell you--silence! If he only believes you can read; if he
only suspects you have understood; I love you, my dear friends, I would
willingly be killed for you, but--”

“But--” said Athos and Raoul.

“But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you
from death. Silence, then! Silence again!”

The governor came up, having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge.

“Well!” said he to D’Artagnan, “what stops us?”

“You are Spaniards--you do not understand a word of French,” said the
captain, eagerly, to his friends in a low voice.

“Well!” replied he, addressing the governor, “I was right; these
gentlemen are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres,
last year; they don’t know a word of French.”

“Ah!” said the governor, sharply. “And yet they were trying to read the
inscription on the plate.”

D’Artagnan took it out of his hands, effacing the characters with the
point of his sword.

“How!” cried the governor, “what are you doing? I cannot read them now!”

“It is a state secret,” replied D’Artagnan, bluntly; “and as you know
that, according to the king’s orders, it is under the penalty of death
any one should penetrate it, I will, if you like, allow you to read it,
and have you shot immediately afterwards.”

During this apostrophe--half serious, half ironical--Athos and Raoul
preserved the coolest, most unconcerned silence.

“But, is it possible,” said the governor, “that these gentlemen do not
comprehend at least some words?”

“Suppose they do! If they do understand a few spoken words, it does not
follow that they should understand what is written. They cannot even
read Spanish. A noble Spaniard, remember, ought never to know how to
read.”

The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations, but he
was still tenacious. “Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress,”
 said he.

“That I will willingly do. I was about to propose it to you.” The
fact is, the captain had quite another idea, and would have wished his
friends a hundred leagues off. But he was obliged to make the best of
it. He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish, giving them a polite
invitation, which they accepted. They all turned towards the entrance of
the fort, and, the incident being at an end, the eight soldiers returned
to their delightful leisure, for a moment disturbed by this unexpected
adventure.



Chapter XXXII. Captive and Jailers.

When they had entered the fort, and whilst the governor was making some
preparations for the reception of his guests, “Come,” said Athos, “let
us have a word of explanation whilst we are alone.”

“It is simply this,” replied the musketeer. “I have conducted hither a
prisoner, who the king commands shall not be seen. You came here, he
has thrown something to you through the lattice of his window; I was at
dinner with the governor, I saw the object thrown, and I saw Raoul pick
it up. It does not take long to understand this. I understood it, and I
thought you in intelligence with my prisoner. And then--”

“And then--you commanded us to be shot.”

“_Ma foi!_ I admit it; but, if I was the first to seize a musket,
fortunately, I was the last to take aim at you.”

“If you had killed me, D’Artagnan, I should have had the good fortune
to die for the royal house of France, and it would be an honor to die by
your hand--you, its noblest and most loyal defender.”

“What the devil, Athos, do you mean by the royal house?” stammered
D’Artagnan. “You don’t mean that you, a well-informed and sensible man,
can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot?”

“I do believe in it.”

“With so much the more reason, my dear chevalier, from your having
orders to kill all those who do believe in it,” said Raoul.

“That is because,” replied the captain of the musketeers--“because every
calumny, however absurd it may be, has the almost certain chance of
becoming popular.”

“No, D’Artagnan,” replied Athos, promptly; “but because the king is not
willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people,
and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII.”

“Do not talk in such a childish manner, Athos, or I shall begin to think
you have lost your senses. Besides, explain to me how it is possible
Louis XIII. should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite.”

“A son whom you have brought hither masked, in a fishing-boat,” said
Athos. “Why not?”

D’Artagnan was brought to a pause.

“Oh!” said he; “whence do you know that a fishing-boat--?”

“Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite’s with the carriage containing
the prisoner--with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur. Oh! I
am acquainted with all that,” resumed the comte. D’Artagnan bit his
mustache.

“If it were true,” said he, “that I had brought hither in a boat and
with a carriage a masked prisoner, nothing proves that this prisoner
must be a prince--a prince of the house of France.”

“Ask Aramis such riddles,” replied Athos, coolly.

“Aramis,” cried the musketeer, quite at a stand. “Have you seen Aramis?”

“After his discomfiture at Vaux, yes; I have seen Aramis, a fugitive,
pursued, bewildered, ruined; and Aramis has told me enough to make me
believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the
bottom of the plate.”

D’Artagnan’s head sunk on his breast in some confusion. “This is the
way,” said he, “in which God turns to nothing that which men call
wisdom! A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons
hold the tattered fragments! Athos, cursed be the chance which has
brought you face to face with me in this affair! for now--”

“Well,” said Athos, with his customary mild severity, “is your secret
lost because I know it? Consult your memory, my friend. Have I not borne
secrets heavier than this?”

“You have never borne one so dangerous,” replied D’Artagnan, in a tone
of sadness. “I have something like a sinister idea that all who are
concerned with this secret will die, and die unhappily.”

“The will of God be done!” said Athos, “but here is your governor.”

D’Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts. The
governor, suspicious and hard, behaved towards D’Artagnan with a
politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness. With respect to the
travelers, he contented himself with offering good cheer, and never
taking his eye from them. Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried
to embarrass them by sudden attacks, or to catch them off their guard;
but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage. What
D’Artagnan had said was probable, if the governor did not believe it to
be quite true. They rose from the table to repose awhile.

“What is this man’s name? I don’t like the looks of him,” said Athos to
D’Artagnan in Spanish.

“De Saint-Mars,” replied the captain.

“He is, then, I suppose, the prince’s jailer?”

“Eh! how can I tell? I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever.”

“Oh! no, not you!”

“My friend, I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the
midst of a desert. He would like to carry it away, but he cannot; he
would like to leave it, but he dares not. The king will not dare to
recall me, for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do; he
regrets not having me near him, from being aware that no one would be of
so much service near his person as myself. But it will happen as it may
please God.”

“But,” observed Raoul, “your not being certain proves that your
situation here is provisional, and you will return to Paris?”

“Ask these gentlemen,” interrupted the governor, “what was their purpose
in coming to Saint-Marguerite?”

“They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at
Sainte-Honnorat which is considered curious; and from being told there
was excellent shooting in the island.”

“That is quite at their service, as well as yours,” replied Saint-Mars.

D’Artagnan politely thanked him.

“When will they depart?” added the governor.

“To-morrow,” replied D’Artagnan.

M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds, and left D’Artagnan alone with
the pretended Spaniards.

“Oh!” exclaimed the musketeer, “here is a life and a society that suits
me very little. I command this man, and he bores me, _mordioux!_ Come,
let us have a shot or two at the rabbits; the walk will be beautiful,
and not fatiguing. The whole island is but a league and a half in
length, with the breadth of a league; a real park. Let us try to amuse
ourselves.”

“As you please, D’Artagnan; not for the sake of amusing ourselves, but
to gain an opportunity for talking freely.”

D’Artagnan made a sign to a soldier, who brought the gentlemen some
guns, and then returned to the fort.

“And now,” said the musketeer, “answer me the question put to you by
that black-looking Saint-Mars: what did you come to do at the Lerin
Isles?”

“To bid you farewell.”

“Bid me farewell! What do you mean by that? Is Raoul going anywhere?”

“Yes.”

“Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort.”

“With M. de Beaufort it is, my dear friend. You always guess correctly.”

“From habit.”

Whilst the two friends were commencing their conversation, Raoul, with
his head hanging down and his heart oppressed, seated himself on a
mossy rock, his gun across his knees, looking at the sea--looking at
the heavens, and listening to the voice of his soul; he allowed the
sportsmen to attain a considerable distance from him. D’Artagnan
remarked his absence.

“He has not recovered the blow?” said he to Athos.

“He is struck to death.”

“Oh! your fears exaggerate, I hope. Raoul is of a tempered nature.
Around all hearts as noble as his, there is a second envelope that forms
a cuirass. The first bleeds, the second resists.”

“No,” replied Athos, “Raoul will die of it.”

“_Mordioux!_” said D’Artagnan, in a melancholy tone. And he did not add
a word to this exclamation. Then, a minute after, “Why do you let him
go?”

“Because he insists on going.”

“And why do you not go with him?”

“Because I could not bear to see him die.”

D’Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face. “You know one
thing,” continued the comte, leaning upon the arm of the captain; “you
know that in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things.
Well! I have an incessant gnawing, insurmountable fear that an hour will
come in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms.”

“Oh!” murmured D’Artagnan; “oh!”

“He will die, I know, I have a perfect conviction of that; but I would
not see him die.”

“How is this, Athos? you come and place yourself in the presence of the
bravest man, you say you have ever seen, of your own D’Artagnan, of that
man without an equal, as you formerly called him, and you come and tell
him, with your arms folded, that you are afraid of witnessing the death
of your son, you who have seen all that can be seen in this world! Why
have you this fear, Athos? Man upon this earth must expect everything,
and ought to face everything.”

“Listen to me, my friend. After having worn myself out upon this earth
of which you speak, I have preserved but two religions: that of life,
friendship, my duty as a father--that of eternity, love, and respect for
God. Now, I have within me the revelation that if God should decree that
my friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence--oh!
no, I cannot even tell you, D’Artagnan!”

“Speak, speak, tell me!”

“I am strong against everything, except against the death of those I
love. For that only there is no remedy. He who dies, gains; he who sees
others die, loses. No, this is it--to know that I should no more meet on
earth him whom I now behold with joy; to know that there would nowhere
be a D’Artagnan any more, nowhere again be a Raoul, oh! I am old, look
you, I have no longer courage; I pray God to spare me in my weakness;
but if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion, I should curse him.
A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God, D’Artagnan; it is
enough to once have cursed a king!”

“Humph!” sighed D’Artagnan, a little confused by this violent tempest of
grief.

“Let me speak to him, Athos. Who knows?”

“Try, if you please, but I am convinced you will not succeed.”

“I will not attempt to console him. I will serve him.”

“You will?”

“Doubtless, I will. Do you think this would be the first time a woman
had repented of an infidelity? I will go to him, I tell you.”

Athos shook his head, and continued his walk alone, D’Artagnan, cutting
across the brambles, rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him. “Well,
Raoul! You have something to say to me?”

“I have a kindness to ask of you,” replied Bragelonne.

“Ask it, then.”

“You will some day return to France?”

“I hope so.”

“Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Valliere?”

“No, you must not.”

“But I have many things to say to her.”

“Go and say them to her, then.”

“Never!”

“Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might
not possess?”

“Perhaps you are right.”

“She loves the king,” said D’Artagnan, bluntly; “and she is an honest
girl.” Raoul started. “And you, you whom she abandons, she, perhaps,
loves better than she does the king, but after another fashion.”

“D’Artagnan, do you believe she loves the king?”

“To idolatry. Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling. You might
continue to live near her, and would be her best friend.”

“Ah!” exclaimed Raoul, with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a
hideous hope.

“Will you do so?”

“It would be base.”

“That is a very absurd word, which would lead me to think slightly of
your understanding. Please to understand, Raoul, that it is never base
to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force. If your heart
says to you, ‘Go there, or die,’ why go, Raoul. Was she base or brave,
she whom you loved, in preferring the king to you, the king whom her
heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you? No, she was the
bravest of women. Do, then, as she has done. Oblige yourself. Do you
know one thing of which I am sure, Raoul?”

“What is that?”

“Why, that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man--”

“Well?”

“Well! you would cease to love her.”

“Then I am decided, my dear D’Artagnan.”

“To set off to see her again?”

“No; to set off that I may _never_ see her again. I wish to love her
forever.”

“Ha! I must confess,” replied the musketeer, “that is a conclusion which
I was far from expecting.”

“This is what I wish, my friend. You will see her again, and you will
give her a letter which, if you think proper, will explain to her, as to
yourself, what is passing in my heart. Read it; I drew it up last night.
Something told me I should see you to-day.” He held the letter out, and
D’Artagnan read:

“MADEMOISELLE,--You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me. You have
only been guilty of one fault towards me, that of having left me to
believe you loved me. This error will cost me my life. I pardon you,
but I cannot pardon myself. It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the
sorrows of rejected lovers. It will not be so with you, who did not love
me, save with anxiety. I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring
to change that friendship into love, you would have yielded out of a
fear of bringing about my death, or lessening the esteem I had for you.
It is much more delightful to me to die, knowing that _you_ are free
and satisfied. How much, then, will you love me, when you will no
longer fear either my presence or reproaches? You will love me, because,
however charming a new love may appear to you, God has not made me in
anything inferior to him you have chosen, and because my devotedness,
my sacrifice, and my painful end will assure me, in your eyes, a certain
superiority over him. I have allowed to escape, in the candid credulity
of my heart, the treasure I possessed. Many people tell me that you
loved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much. That
idea takes from my mind all bitterness, and leads me only to blame
myself. You will accept this last farewell, and you will bless me
for having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is
extinguished, and where all love endures forever. Adieu, mademoiselle.
If your happiness could be purchased by the last drop of my blood, I
would shed that drop. I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery!

“RAOUL, VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE.”


“The letter reads very well,” said the captain. “I have only one fault
to find with it.”

“Tell me what that is!” said Raoul.

“Why, it is that it tells everything, except the thing which exhales,
like a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart; except the
senseless love which still consumes you.” Raoul grew paler, but remained
silent.

“Why did you not write simply these words:

“‘MADEMOISELLE,--Instead of cursing you, I love you and I die.’”

“That is true,” exclaimed Raoul, with a sinister kind of joy.

And tearing the letter he had just taken back, he wrote the following
words upon a leaf of his tablets:

“To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you, I commit
the baseness of writing to you; and to punish myself for that baseness,
I die.” And he signed it.

“You will give her these tablets, captain, will you not?”

“When?” asked the latter.

“On the day,” said Bragelonne, pointing to the last sentence, “on the
day when you can place a date under these words.” And he sprang away
quickly to join Athos, who was returning with slow steps.

As they re-entered the fort, the sea rose with that rapid, gusty
vehemence which characterizes the Mediterranean; the ill-humor of
the element became a tempest. Something shapeless, and tossed about
violently by the waves, appeared just off the coast.

“What is that?” said Athos,--“a wrecked boat?”

“No, it is not a boat,” said D’Artagnan.

“Pardon me,” said Raoul, “there is a bark gaining the port rapidly.”

“Yes, there is a bark in the creek, which is prudently seeking shelter
here; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at
all--it has run aground.”

“Yes, yes, I see it.”

“It is the carriage, which I threw into the sea after landing the
prisoner.”

“Well!” said Athos, “if you take my advice, D’Artagnan, you will burn
that carriage, in order that no vestige of it may remain, without which
the fishermen of Antibes, who have believed they had to do with the
devil, will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man.”

“Your advice is good, Athos, and I will this night have it carried out,
or rather, I will carry it out myself; but let us go in, for the rain
falls heavily, and the lightning is terrific.”

As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D’Artagnan
had the key, they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the
chamber inhabited by the prisoner. Upon a sign from D’Artagnan, they
concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase.

“What is it?” said Athos.

“You will see. Look. The prisoner is returning from chapel.”

And they saw, by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog
which the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky, they saw pass gravely,
at six paces behind the governor, a man clothed in black and masked by a
vizor of polished steel, soldered to a helmet of the same nature, which
altogether enveloped the whole of his head. The fire of the heavens cast
red reflections on the polished surface, and these reflections, flying
off capriciously, seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate,
instead of imprecations. In the middle of the gallery, the prisoner
stopped for a moment, to contemplate the infinite horizon, to respire
the sulphurous perfumes of the tempest, to drink in thirstily the hot
rain, and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan.

“Come on, monsieur,” said Saint-Mars, sharply, to the prisoner, for
he already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls.
“Monsieur, come on!”

“Say monseigneur!” cried Athos, from his corner, with a voice so solemn
and terrible, that the governor trembled from head to foot. Athos
insisted upon respect being paid to fallen majesty. The prisoner turned
round.

“Who spoke?” asked Saint-Mars.

“It was I,” replied D’Artagnan, showing himself promptly. “You know that
is the order.”

“Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur,” said the prisoner in his
turn, in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul; “call me
ACCURSED!” He passed on, and the iron door croaked after him.

“There goes a truly unfortunate man!” murmured the musketeer in a hollow
whisper, pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince.



Chapter XXXIII. Promises.

Scarcely had D’Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends,
when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the
governor was seeking him. The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea, and
which appeared so eager to gain the port, came to Sainte-Marguerite with
an important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers. On opening it,
D’Artagnan recognized the writing of the king: “I should think,”
 said Louis XIV., “you will have completed the execution of my orders,
Monsieur d’Artagnan; return, then, immediately to Paris, and join me at
the Louvre.”

“There is the end of my exile!” cried the musketeer with joy; “God be
praised, I am no longer a jailer!” And he showed the letter to Athos.

“So, then, you must leave us?” replied the latter, in a melancholy tone.

“Yes, but to meet again, dear friend, seeing that Raoul is old enough
now to go alone with M. de Beaufort, and will prefer his father going
back in company with M. d’Artagnan, to forcing him to travel two hundred
leagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere; will you not, Raoul?”

“Certainly,” stammered the latter, with an expression of tender regret.

“No, no, my friend,” interrupted Athos, “I will never quit Raoul till
the day his vessel disappears on the horizon. As long as he remains in
France he shall not be separated from me.”

“As you please, dear friend; but we will, at least, leave
Sainte-Marguerite together; take advantage of the bark that will convey
me back to Antibes.”

“With all my heart; we cannot too soon be at a distance from this fort,
and from the spectacle that shocked us so just now.”

The three friends quitted the little isle, after paying their respects
to the governor, and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they
took their farewell of the white walls of the fort. D’Artagnan parted
from his friend that same night, after having seen fire set to the
carriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars, according to the
advice the captain had given him. Before getting on horseback, and after
leaving the arms of Athos: “My friends,” said he, “you bear too much
resemblance to two soldiers who are abandoning their post. Something
warns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank.
Will you allow me to ask permission to go over into Africa with a
hundred good muskets? The king will not refuse me, and I will take you
with me.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” replied Raoul, pressing his hand with emotion,
“thanks for that offer, which would give us more than we wish, either
monsieur le comte or I. I, who am young, stand in need of labor of mind
and fatigue of body; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose. You
are his best friend. I recommend him to your care. In watching over him,
you are holding both our souls in your hands.”

“I must go; my horse is all in a fret,” said D’Artagnan, with whom
the most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas
in conversation. “Come, comte, how many days longer has Raoul to stay
here?”

“Three days at most.”

“And how long will it take you to reach home?”

“Oh! a considerable time,” replied Athos. “I shall not like the idea
of being separated too quickly from Raoul. Time will travel too fast
of itself to require me to aid it by distance. I shall only make
half-stages.”

“And why so, my friend? Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly; and
hostelry life does not become a man like you.”

“My friend, I came hither on post-horses; but I wish to purchase two
animals of a superior kind. Now, to take them home fresh, it would not
be prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day.”

“Where is Grimaud?”

“He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul’s appointments; and I have left
him to sleep.”

“That is, never to come back again,” D’Artagnan suffered to escape him.
“Till we meet again, then, dear Athos--and if you are diligent, I shall
embrace you the sooner.” So saying, he put his foot in the stirrup,
which Raoul held.

“Farewell!” said the young man, embracing him.

“Farewell!” said D’Artagnan, as he got into his saddle.

His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends.
This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos, near
the gates of Antibes, whither D’Artagnan, after his supper, had ordered
his horses to be brought. The road began to branch off there, white and
undulating in the vapors of the night. The horse eagerly respired the
salt, sharp perfume of the marshes. D’Artagnan put him to a trot; and
Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house. All at once they heard
the rapid approach of a horse’s steps, and first believed it to be one
of those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in
a road. But it was really the return of the horseman. They uttered a
cry of joyous surprise; and the captain, springing to the ground like
a young man, seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and
Raoul. He held them long embraced thus, without speaking a word, or
suffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him. Then, as
rapidly as he had come back, he set off again, with a sharp application
of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse.

“Alas!” said the comte, in a low voice, “alas! alas!”

“An evil omen!” on his side, said D’Artagnan to himself, making up for
lost time. “I could not smile upon them. An evil omen!”

The next day Grimaud was on foot again. The service commanded by M. de
Beaufort was happily accomplished. The flotilla, sent to Toulon by the
exertions of Raoul, had set out, dragging after it in little nutshells,
almost invisible, the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers
put in requisition for the service of the fleet. The time, so short,
which remained for father and son to live together, appeared to go
by with double rapidity, like some swift stream that flows towards
eternity. Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon, which began to be filled
with the noise of carriages, with the noise of arms, the noise of
neighing horses. The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches; the
drummers signalized their strength; the streets were overflowing
with soldiers, servants, and tradespeople. The Duc de Beaufort was
everywhere, superintending the embarkation with the zeal and interest of
a good captain. He encouraged the humblest of his companions; he scolded
his lieutenants, even those of the highest rank. Artillery, provisions,
baggage, he insisted upon seeing all himself. He examined the equipment
of every soldier; assured himself of the health and soundness of every
horse. It was plain that, light, boastful, egotistical, in his hotel,
the gentleman became the soldier again--the high noble, a captain--in
face of the responsibility he had accepted. And yet, it must be admitted
that, whatever was the care with which he presided over the preparations
for departure, it was easy to perceive careless precipitation, and the
absence of all the precaution that make the French soldier the first
soldier in the world, because, in that world, he is the one most
abandoned to his own physical and moral resources. All things having
satisfied, or appearing to have satisfied, the admiral, he paid his
compliments to Raoul, and gave the last orders for sailing, which was
ordered the next morning at daybreak. He invited the comte had his son
to dine with him; but they, under a pretext of service, kept themselves
apart. Gaining their hostelry, situated under the trees of the great
Place, they took their repast in haste, and Athos led Raoul to the
rocks which dominate the city, vast gray mountains, whence the view is
infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears, so remote is it,
on a level with the rocks themselves. The night was fine, as it always
is in these happy climes. The moon, rising behind the rocks, unrolled
a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea. In the roadsteads
maneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank to
facilitate the embarkation. The sea, loaded with phosphoric light,
opened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and
munitions; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames;
from every oar dropped liquid diamonds. The sailors, rejoicing in the
largesses of the admiral, were heard murmuring their slow and artless
songs. Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull
noise of shot falling into the holds. Such harmonies, such a spectacle,
oppress the heart like fear, and dilate it like hope. All this life
speaks of death. Athos had seated himself with his son, upon the moss,
among the brambles of the promontory. Around their heads passed and
repassed large bats, carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind
chase. The feet of Raoul were over the edge of the cliff, bathed in that
void which is peopled by vertigo, and provokes to self-annihilation.
When the moon had risen to its fullest height, caressing with light
the neighboring peaks, when the watery mirror was illumined in its full
extent, and the little red fires had made their openings in the black
masses of every ship, Athos, collecting all his ideas and all his
courage, said:

“God has made all these things that we see, Raoul; He has made us
also,--poor atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe. We shine like
those fires and those stars; we sigh like those waves; we suffer like
those great ships, which are worn out in plowing the waves, in obeying
the wind that urges them towards an end, as the breath of God blows us
towards a port. Everything likes to live, Raoul; and everything seems
beautiful to living things.”

“Monsieur,” said Raoul, “we have before us a beautiful spectacle!”

“How good D’Artagnan is!” interrupted Athos, suddenly, “and what a rare
good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend
as he is! That is what you have missed, Raoul.”

“A friend!” cried Raoul, “I have wanted a friend!”

“M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion,” resumed the comte, coldly,
“but I believe, in the times in which you live, men are more engaged in
their own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours. You
have sought a secluded life; that is a great happiness, but you have
lost your strength thereby. We four, more weaned from those delicate
abstractions that constitute your joy, furnished much more resistance
when misfortune presented itself.”

“I have not interrupted you, monsieur, to tell you that I had a friend,
and that that friend is M. de Guiche. _Certes_, he is good and generous,
and moreover he loves me. But I have lived under the guardianship of
another friendship, monsieur, as precious and as strong as that of which
you speak, since it is yours.”

“I have not been a friend for you, Raoul,” said Athos.

“Eh! monsieur, and in what respect not?”

“Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face,
because, sad and severe, alas! I have always cut off for you, without,
God knows, wishing to do so, the joyous buds that spring incessantly
from the fair tree of youth; so that at this moment I repent of not
having made of you a more expansive, dissipated, animated man.”

“I know why you say that, monsieur. No, it is not you who have made me
what I am; it was love, which took me at the time when children only
have inclinations; it is the constancy natural to my character, which
with other creatures is but habit. I believed that I should always be as
I was; I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear, quite straight,
bordered with fruits and flowers. I had ever watching over me your
vigilance and strength. I believed myself to be vigilant and strong.
Nothing prepared me; I fell once, and that once deprived me of courage
for the whole of my life. It is quite true that I wrecked myself. Oh,
no, monsieur! you are nothing in my past but happiness--in my future but
hope! No, I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it
for me; I bless you, and I love you ardently.”

“My dear Raoul, your words do me good. They prove to me that you will
act a little for me in the time to come.”

“I shall only act for you, monsieur.”

“Raoul, what I have never hitherto done with respect to you, I will
henceforward do. I will be your friend, not your father. We will live in
expanding ourselves, instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners,
when you come back. And that will be soon, will it not?”

“Certainly, monsieur, for such an expedition cannot last long.”

“Soon, then, Raoul, soon, instead of living moderately on my income, I
will give you the capital of my estates. It will suffice for launching
you into the world till my death; and you will give me, I hope, before
that time, the consolation of not seeing my race extinct.”

“I will do all you may command,” said Raoul, much agitated.

“It is not necessary, Raoul, that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead
you into too hazardous enterprises. You have gone through your ordeal;
you are known to be a true man under fire. Remember that war with Arabs
is a war of snares, ambuscades, and assassinations.”

“So it is said, monsieur.”

“There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade. It is a death
which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight. Often,
indeed, he who falls in one meets with but little pity. Those who are
not pitied, Raoul, have died to little purpose. Still further, the
conqueror laughs, and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to
triumph over our faults. Do you clearly understand what I am saying to
you, Raoul? God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters.”

“I am naturally prudent, monsieur, and I have very good fortune,” said
Raoul, with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father; “for,”
 the young man hastened to add, “in twenty combats through which I have
been, I have only received one scratch.”

“There is in addition,” said Athos, “the climate to be dreaded: that is
an ugly end, to die of fever! King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an
arrow or the plague, rather than the fever.”

“Oh, monsieur! with sobriety, with reasonable exercise--”

“I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his
dispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France. You, as his
aide-de-camp, will be charged with expediting them, and will be sure not
to forget me.”

“No, monsieur,” said Raoul, almost choked with emotion.

“Besides, Raoul, as you are a good Christian, and I am one also, we
ought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian
angels. Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you, on any
occasion, you will think of me at once.”

“First and at once! Oh! yes, monsieur.”

“And will call upon me?”

“Instantly.”

“You dream of me sometimes, do you not, Raoul?”

“Every night, monsieur. During my early youth I saw you in my dreams,
calm and mild, with one hand stretched out over my head, and that it was
which made me sleep so soundly--formerly.”

“We love each other too dearly,” said the comte, “that from this moment,
in which we separate, a portion of both our souls should not travel with
one and the other of us, and should not dwell wherever we may dwell.
Whenever you may be sad, Raoul, I feel that my heart will be dissolved
in sadness; and when you smile on thinking of me, be assured you will
send me, from however remote a distance, a vital scintillation of your
joy.”

“I will not promise you to be joyous,” replied the young man; “but you
may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you,
not one hour, I swear, unless I shall be dead.”

Athos could contain himself no longer; he threw his arm round the neck
of his son, and held him embraced with all the power of his heart. The
moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight; a golden band surrounded the
horizon, announcing the approach of the day. Athos threw his cloak over
the shoulders of Raoul, and led him back to the city, where burdens and
porters were already in motion, like a vast ant-hill. At the extremity
of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting, they saw a dark
shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards, as if in indecision or
ashamed to be seen. It was Grimaud, who in his anxiety had tracked his
master, and was there awaiting him.

“Oh! my good Grimaud,” cried Raoul, “what do you want? You are come to
tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?”

“Alone?” said Grimaud, addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone
of reproach, which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled.

“Oh! you are right!” cried the comte. “No, Raoul shall not go alone; no,
he shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand
to support him, some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved!”

“I?” said Grimaud.

“You, yes, you!” cried Raoul, touched to the inmost heart.

“Alas!” said Athos, “you are very old, my good Grimaud.”

“So much the better,” replied the latter, with an inexpressible depth of
feeling and intelligence.

“But the embarkation is begun,” said Raoul, “and you are not prepared.”

“Yes,” said Grimaud, showing the keys of his trunks, mixed with those of
his young master.

“But,” again objected Raoul, “you cannot leave monsieur le comte thus
alone; monsieur le comte, whom you have never quitted?”

Grimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul, as if to measure
the strength of both. The comte uttered not a word.

“Monsieur le comte prefers my going,” said Grimaud.

“I do,” said Athos, by an inclination of the head.

At that moment the drums suddenly rolled, and the clarions filled
the air with their inspiring notes. The regiments destined for the
expedition began to debouch from the city. They advanced to the number
of five, each composed of forty companies. Royals marched first,
distinguished by their white uniform, faced with blue. The _ordonnance_
colors, quartered cross-wise, violet and dead leaf, with a sprinkling
of golden _fleurs-de-lis_, left the white-colored flag, with its
_fleur-de-lised_ cross, to dominate the whole. Musketeers at the wings,
with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders; pikemen
in the center, with their lances, fourteen feet in length, marched gayly
towards the transports, which carried them in detail to the ships. The
regiments of Picardy, Navarre, Normandy, and Royal Vaisseau, followed
after. M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops. He
himself was seen closing the march with his staff--it would take a full
hour before he could reach the sea. Raoul with Athos turned his steps
slowly towards the beach, in order to take his place when the prince
embarked. Grimaud, boiling with the ardor of a young man, superintended
the embarkation of Raoul’s baggage in the admiral’s vessel. Athos, with
his arm passed through that of the son he was about to lose, absorbed
in melancholy meditation, was deaf to every noise around him. An officer
came quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was
anxious to have him by his side.

“Have the kindness to tell the prince,” said Raoul, “that I request he
will allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father.”

“No, no,” said Athos, “an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his
general. Please to tell the prince, monsieur, that the vicomte will join
him immediately.” The officer set off at a gallop.

“Whether we part here or part there,” added the comte, “it is no less
a separation.” He carefully brushed the dust from his son’s coat, and
passed his hand over his hair as they walked along. “But, Raoul,” said
he, “you want money. M. de Beaufort’s train will be splendid, and I am
certain it will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms, which
are very dear things in Africa. Now, as you are not actually in the
service of the king or M. de Beaufort, and are simply a volunteer, you
must not reckon upon either pay or largesse. But I should not like you
to want for anything at Gigelli. Here are two hundred pistoles; if you
would please me, Raoul, spend them.”

Raoul pressed the hand of his father, and, at the turning of a street,
they saw M. de Beaufort, mounted on a magnificent white _genet_, which
responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the city.
The duke called Raoul, and held out his hand to the comte. He spoke to
him for some time, with such a kindly expression that the heart of the
poor father even felt a little comforted. It was, however, evident to
both father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a
punishment. There was a terrible moment--that at which, on quitting the
sands of the shore, the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last
kisses with their families and friends; a supreme moment, in which,
notwithstanding the clearness of the heavens, the warmth of the sun, of
the perfumes of the air, and the rich life that was circulating in their
veins, everything appeared black, everything bitter, everything created
doubts of Providence, nay, at the most, of God. It was customary for
the admiral and his suite to embark last; the cannon waited to announce,
with its formidable voice, that the leader had placed his foot on board
his vessel. Athos, forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet, and of
his own dignity as a strong man, opened his arms to his son, and pressed
him convulsively to his heart.

“Accompany us on board,” said the duke, very much affected; “you will
gain a good half-hour.”

“No,” said Athos, “my farewell has been spoken, I do not wish to voice a
second.”

“Then, vicomte, embark--embark quickly!” added the prince, wishing
to spare the tears of these two men, whose hearts were bursting. And
paternally, tenderly, very much as Porthos might have done, he took
Raoul in his arms and placed him in the boat, the oars of which, at a
signal, immediately were dipped in the waves. He himself, forgetful of
ceremony, jumped into his boat, and pushed it off with a vigorous foot.
“Adieu!” cried Raoul.

Athos replied only by a sign, but he felt something burning on his hand:
it was the respectful kiss of Grimaud--the last farewell of the faithful
dog. This kiss given, Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole upon
the stem of a two-oared yawl, which had just been taken in tow by a
_chaland_ served by twelve galley-oars. Athos seated himself on the
mole, stunned, deaf, abandoned. Every instant took from him one of the
features, one of the shades of the pale face of his son. With his arms
hanging down, his eyes fixed, his mouth open, he remained confounded
with Raoul--in one same look, in one same thought, in one same stupor.
The sea, by degrees, carried away boats and faces to that distance at
which men become nothing but points,--loves, nothing but remembrances.
Athos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral’s ship, he saw him
lean upon the rail of the deck, and place himself in such a manner as
to be always an object in the eye of his father. In vain the cannon
thundered, in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult,
responded to by immense acclamations from the shore; in vain did the
noise deafen the ear of the father, the smoke obscured the cherished
object of his aspirations. Raoul appeared to him to the last moment; and
the imperceptible atom, passing from black to pale, from pale to white,
from white to nothing, disappeared for Athos--disappeared very long
after, to all the eyes of the spectators, had disappeared both gallant
ships and swelling sails. Towards midday, when the sun devoured space,
and scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent limit of
the sea, Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise, and vanish as soon
as seen. This was the smoke of a cannon, which M. de Beaufort ordered to
be fired as a last salute to the coast of France. The point was buried
in its turn beneath the sky, and Athos returned with slow and painful
step to his deserted hostelry.



Chapter XXXIV. Among Women.

D’Artagnan had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends
so much as he would have wished. The stoical soldier, the impassive
man-at-arms, overcome by fear and sad presentiments, had yielded, for
a few moments, to human weakness. When, therefore, he had silenced
his heart and calmed the agitation of his nerves, turning towards his
lackey, a silent servant, always listening, in order to obey the more
promptly:

“Rabaud,” said he, “mind, we must travel thirty leagues a day.”

“At your pleasure, captain,” replied Rabaud.

And from that moment, D’Artagnan, accommodating his action to the pace
of the horse, like a true centaur, gave up his thoughts to nothing--that
is to say, to everything. He asked himself why the king had sent for
him back; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of
Raoul. As to the first subject, the reply was negative; he knew right
well that the king’s calling him was from necessity. He still further
knew that Louis XIV. must experience an imperious desire for a private
conversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a
level with the highest powers of the kingdom. But as to saying exactly
what the king’s wish was, D’Artagnan found himself completely at a loss.
The musketeer had no doubts, either, upon the reason which had urged the
unfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth. Philippe, buried
forever beneath a mask of steel, exiled to a country where the men
seemed little more than slaves of the elements; Philippe, deprived
even of the society of D’Artagnan, who had loaded him with honors and
delicate attentions, had nothing more to see than odious specters in
this world, and, despair beginning to devour him, he poured himself
forth in complaints, in the belief that his revelations would raise up
some avenger for him. The manner in which the musketeer had been near
killing his two best friends, the destiny which had so strangely brought
Athos to participate in the great state secret, the farewell of Raoul,
the obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a melancholy
death; all this threw D’Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable
predictions and forebodings, which the rapidity of his pace did not
dissipate, as it used formerly to do. D’Artagnan passed from these
considerations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos and Aramis.
He saw them both, fugitives, tracked, ruined--laborious architects of
fortunes they had lost; and as the king called for his man of execution
in hours of vengeance and malice, D’Artagnan trembled at the very
idea of receiving some commission that would make his very soul bleed.
Sometimes, ascending hills, when the winded horse breathed hard from his
red nostrils, and heaved his flanks, the captain, left to more freedom
of thought, reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis, a genius of
acumen and intrigue, a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had
produced but twice. Soldier, priest, diplomatist; gallant, avaricious,
cunning; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except
as stepping-stones to rise to giddier ends. Generous in spirit, if not
lofty in heart, he never did ill but for the sake of shining even
yet more brilliantly. Towards the end of his career, at the moment of
reaching the goal, like the patrician Fuscus, he had made a false step
upon a plank, and had fallen into the sea. But Porthos, good, harmless
Porthos! To see Porthos hungry, to see Mousqueton without gold lace,
imprisoned, perhaps; to see Pierrefonds, Bracieux, razed to the very
stones, dishonored even to the timber,--these were so many poignant
griefs for D’Artagnan, and every time that one of these griefs struck
him, he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults
of foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun. Never
was the man of spirit subjected to _ennui_, if his body was exposed to
fatigue; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light, if
he had something to engage his mind. D’Artagnan, riding fast, thinking
as constantly, alighted from his horse in Pairs, fresh and tender in
his muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium. The king did not
expect him so soon, and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon.
D’Artagnan, instead of riding after the king, as he would formerly have
done, took off his boots, had a bath, and waited till his majesty
should return dusty and tired. He occupied the interval of five hours
in taking, as people say, the air of the house, and in arming himself
against all ill chances. He learned that the king, during the last
fortnight, had been gloomy; that the queen-mother was ill and much
depressed; that Monsieur, the king’s brother, was exhibiting a
devotional turn; that Madame had the vapors; and that M. de Guiche was
gone to one of his estates. He learned that M. Colbert was radiant; that
M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day, who still did not cure
him, and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not
usually cure, unless they are political physicians. The king, D’Artagnan
was told, behaved in the kindest manner to M. Fouquet, and did not allow
him to be ever out of his sight; but the surintendant, touched to the
heart, like one of those fine trees a worm has punctured, was declining
daily, in spite of the royal smile, that sun of court trees. D’Artagnan
learned that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had become indispensable to the
king; that the king, during his sporting excursions, if he did not take
her with him, wrote to her frequently, no longer verses, but, which
was much worse, prose, and that whole pages at a time. Thus, as the
political Pleiad of the day said, the _first king in the world_ was seen
descending from his horse _with an ardor beyond compare_, and on the
crown of his hat scrawling bombastic phrases, which M. de Saint-Aignan,
aide-de-camp in perpetuity, carried to La Valliere at the risk of
foundering his horses. During this time, deer and pheasants were left to
the free enjoyment of their nature, hunted so lazily that, it was said,
the art of venery ran great risk of degenerating at the court of France.
D’Artagnan then thought of the wishes of poor Raoul, of that desponding
letter destined for a woman who passed her life in hoping, and as
D’Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally, he resolved
to profit by the absence of the king to have a minute’s talk with
Mademoiselle de la Valliere. This was a very easy affair; while the king
was hunting, Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of
the galleries of the Palais Royal, exactly where the captain of the
musketeers had some guards to inspect. D’Artagnan did not doubt that,
if he could but open the conversation on Raoul, Louise might give him
grounds for writing a consolatory letter to the poor exile; and hope,
or at least consolation for Raoul, in the state of heart in which he had
left him, was the sun, was life to two men, who were very dear to our
captain. He directed his course, therefore, to the spot where he knew
he should find Mademoiselle de la Valliere. D’Artagnan found La Valliere
the center of the circle. In her apparent solitude, the king’s favorite
received, like a queen, more, perhaps, than the queen, a homage of which
Madame had been so proud, when all the king’s looks were directed to her
and commanded the looks of the courtiers. D’Artagnan, although no squire
of dames, received, nevertheless, civilities and attentions from the
ladies; he was polite, as a brave man always is, and his terrible
reputation had conciliated as much friendship among the men as
admiration among the women. On seeing him enter, therefore, they
immediately accosted him; and, as is not unfrequently the case with fair
ladies, opened the attack by questions. “Where _had_ he been? What _had_
become of him so long? Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine
horse curvet in such beautiful style, to the delight and astonishment of
the curious from the king’s balcony?”

He replied that he had just come from the land of oranges. This set all
the ladies laughing. Those were times in which everybody traveled, but
in which, notwithstanding, a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem
often solved by death.

“From the land of oranges?” cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente. “From
Spain?”

“Eh! eh!” said the musketeer.

“From Malta?” echoed Montalais.

“_Ma foi!_ You are coming very near, ladies.”

“Is it an island?” asked La Valliere.

“Mademoiselle,” said D’Artagnan; “I will not give you the trouble of
seeking any further; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is, at
this moment, embarking for Algiers.”

“Have you seen the army?” asked several warlike fair ones.

“As plainly as I see you,” replied D’Artagnan.

“And the fleet?”

“Yes, I saw everything.”

“Have we any of us any friends there?” said Mademoiselle de
Tonnay-Charente, coldly, but in a manner to attract attention to a
question that was not without its calculated aim.

“Why,” replied D’Artagnan, “yes; there were M. de la Guillotiere, M. de
Manchy, M. de Bragelonne--”

La Valliere became pale. “M. de Bragelonne!” cried the perfidious
Athenais. “Eh, what!--is he gone to the wars?--he!”

Montalais trod on her toe, but all in vain.

“Do you know what my opinion is?” continued she, addressing D’Artagnan.

“No, mademoiselle; but I should like very much to know it.”

“My opinion is, then, that all the men who go to this war are desperate,
desponding men, whom love has treated ill; and who go to try if they
cannot find jet-complexioned women more kind than fair ones have been.”

Some of the ladies laughed; La Valliere was evidently confused;
Montalais coughed loud enough to waken the dead.

“Mademoiselle,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “you are in error when you speak
of black women at Gigelli; the women there have not jet faces; it is
true they are not white--they are yellow.”

“Yellow!” exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties.

“Eh! do not disparage it. I have never seen a finer color to match with
black eyes and a coral mouth.”

“So much the better for M. de Bragelonne,” said Mademoiselle de
Tonnay-Charente, with persistent malice. “He will make amends for his
loss. Poor fellow!”

A profound silence followed these words; and D’Artagnan had time to
observe and reflect that women--mild doves--treat each other more
cruelly than tigers. But making La Valliere pale did not satisfy
Athenais; she determined to make her blush likewise. Resuming the
conversation without pause, “Do you know, Louise,” said she, “that there
is a great sin on your conscience?”

“What sin, mademoiselle?” stammered the unfortunate girl, looking round
her for support, without finding it.

“Eh!--why,” continued Athenais, “the poor young man was affianced to
you; he loved you; you cast him off.”

“Well, that is a right which every honest woman has,” said Montalais, in
an affected tone. “When we know we cannot constitute the happiness of a
man, it is much better to cast him off.”

“Cast him off! or refuse him!--that’s all very well,” said Athenais,
“but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach
herself with. The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars; and
to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with.” Louise pressed
her hand over her icy brow. “And if he dies,” continued her pitiless
tormentor, “you will have killed him. That is the sin.”

Louise, half-dead, caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers,
whose face betrayed unusual emotion. “You wished to speak with me,
Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said she, in a voice broken by anger and pain.
“What had you to say to me?”

D’Artagnan made several steps along the gallery, holding Louise on his
arm; then, when they were far enough removed from the others--“What
I had to say to you, mademoiselle,” replied he, “Mademoiselle de
Tonnay-Charente has just expressed; roughly and unkindly, it is true but
still in its entirety.”

She uttered a faint cry; pierced to the heart by this new wound, she
went her way, like one of those poor birds which, struck unto death,
seek the shade of the thicket in which to die. She disappeared at one
door, at the moment the king was entering by another. The first glance
of the king was directed towards the empty seat of his mistress. Not
perceiving La Valliere, a frown came over his brow; but as soon as he
saw D’Artagnan, who bowed to him--“Ah! monsieur!” cried he, “you _have_
been diligent! I am much pleased with you.” This was the superlative
expression of royal satisfaction. Many men would have been ready to lay
down their lives for such a speech from the king. The maids of honor and
the courtiers, who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his
entrance, drew back, on observing he wished to speak privately with
his captain of the musketeers. The king led the way out of the gallery,
after having again, with his eyes, sought everywhere for La Valliere,
whose absence he could not account for. The moment they were out of
the reach of curious ears, “Well! Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said he, “the
prisoner?”

“Is in his prison, sire.”

“What did he say on the road?”

“Nothing, sire.”

“What did he do?”

“There was a moment at which the fisherman--who took me in his boat
to Sainte-Marguerite--revolted, and did his best to kill me. The--the
prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly.”

The king became pale. “Enough!” said he; and D’Artagnan bowed. Louis
walked about his cabinet with hasty steps. “Were you at Antibes,” said
he, “when Monsieur de Beaufort came there?”

“No, sire; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived.”

“Ah!” which was followed by a fresh silence. “Whom did you see there?”

“A great many persons,” said D’Artagnan, coolly.

The king perceived he was unwilling to speak. “I have sent for you,
monsieur le capitaine, to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at
Nantes.”

“At Nantes!” cried D’Artagnan.

“In Bretagne.”

“Yes, sire, it is in Bretagne. Will you majesty make so long a journey
as to Nantes?”

“The States are assembled there,” replied the king. “I have two demands
to make of them: I wish to be there.”

“When shall I set out?” said the captain.

“This evening--to-morrow--to-morrow evening; for you must stand in need
of rest.”

“I have rested, sire.”

“That is well. Then between this and to-morrow evening, when you
please.”

D’Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave; but, perceiving the king
very much embarrassed, “Will you majesty,” said he, stepping two paces
forward, “take the court with you?”

“Certainly I shall.”

“Then you majesty will, doubtless, want the musketeers?” And the eye of
the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain.

“Take a brigade of them,” replied Louis.

“Is that all? Has your majesty no other orders to give me?”

“No--ah--yes.”

“I am all attention, sire.”

“At the castle of Nantes, which I hear is very ill arranged, you will
adopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the
principal dignitaries I shall take with me.”

“Of the principal?”

“Yes.”

“For instance, at the door of M. de Lyonne?”

“Yes.”

“And that of M. Letellier?”

“Yes.”

“Of M. de Brienne?”

“Yes.”

“And of monsieur le surintendant?”

“Without doubt.”

“Very well, sire. By to-morrow I shall have set out.”

“Oh, yes; but one more word, Monsieur d’Artagnan. At Nantes you will
meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres, captain of the guards. Be sure that
your musketeers are placed before his guards arrive. Precedence always
belongs to the first comer.”

“Yes, sire.”

“And if M. de Gesvres should question you?”

“Question me, sire! Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should question
me?” And the musketeer, turning cavalierly on his heel, disappeared. “To
Nantes!” said he to himself, as he descended from the stairs. “Why did
he not dare to say, from thence to Belle-Isle?”

As he reached the great gates, one of M. Brienne’s clerks came running
after him, exclaiming, “Monsieur d’Artagnan! I beg your pardon--”

“What is the matter, Monsieur Ariste?”

“The king has desired me to give you this order.”

“Upon your cash-box?” asked the musketeer.

“No, monsieur; on that of M. Fouquet.”

D’Artagnan was surprised, but he took the order, which was in the king’s
own writing, and was for two hundred pistoles. “What!” thought he, after
having politely thanked M. Brienne’s clerk, “M. Fouquet is to pay for
the journey, then! _Mordioux!_ that is a bit of pure Louis XI. Why was
not this order on the chest of M. Colbert? He would have paid it with
such joy.” And D’Artagnan, faithful to his principle of never letting
an order at sight get cold, went straight to the house of M. Fouquet, to
receive his two hundred pistoles.



Chapter XXXV. The Last Supper.

The superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching
departure, for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends. From
the bottom to the top of the house, the hurry of the servants bearing
dishes, and the diligence of the _registres_, denoted an approaching
change in offices and kitchen. D’Artagnan, with his order in his hand,
presented himself at the offices, when he was told it was too late
to pay cash, the chest was closed. He only replied: “On the king’s
service.”

The clerk, a little put out by the serious air of the captain, replied,
that “that was a very respectable reason, but that the customs of the
house were respectable likewise; and that, in consequence, he begged the
bearer to call again next day.” D’Artagnan asked if he could not see
M. Fouquet. The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere
with such details, and rudely closed the outer door in the captain’s
face. But the latter had foreseen this stroke, and placed his boot
between the door and the door-case, so that the lock did not catch, and
the clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor. This made him
change his tone, and say, with terrified politeness, “If monsieur wishes
to speak to M. le surintendant, he must go to the ante-chambers; these
are the offices, where monseigneur never comes.”

“Oh! very well! Where are they?” replied D’Artagnan.

“On the other side of the court,” said the clerk, delighted to be free.
D’Artagnan crossed the court, and fell in with a crowd of servants.

“Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour,” he was answered by a fellow
carrying a vermeil dish, in which were three pheasants and twelve
quails.

“Tell him,” said the captain, laying hold of the servant by the end
of his dish, “that I am M. d’Artagnan, captain of his majesty’s
musketeers.”

The fellow uttered a cry of surprise, and disappeared; D’Artagnan
following him slowly. He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in
the ante-chamber: the latter, a little pale, came hastily out of the
dining-room to learn what was the matter. D’Artagnan smiled.

“There is nothing unpleasant, Monsieur Pelisson; only a little order to
receive the money for.”

“Ah!” said Fouquet’s friend, breathing more freely; and he took the
captain by the hand, and, dragging him behind him, led him into the
dining-room, where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant,
placed in the center, and buried in the cushions of a _fauteuil_. There
were assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the
honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet. Joyous
friends, for the most part faithful, they had not fled their protector
at the approach of the storm, and, in spite of the threatening heavens,
in spite of the trembling earth, they remained there, smiling, cheerful,
as devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity. On the left
of the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere; on his right was Madame
Fouquet; as if braving the laws of the world, and putting all vulgar
reasons of propriety to silence, the two protecting angels of this
man united to offer, at the moment of the crisis, the support of
their twined arms. Madame de Belliere was pale, trembling, and full of
respectful attentions for madame la surintendante, who, with one hand on
her husband’s, was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson
had gone out to bring D’Artagnan. The captain entered at first full
of courtesy, and afterwards of admiration, when, with his infallible
glance, he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face.
Fouquet raised himself up in his chair.

“Pardon me, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said he, “if I did not myself receive
you when coming in the king’s name.” And he pronounced the last words
with a sort of melancholy firmness, which filled the hearts of all his
friends with terror.

“Monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “I only come to you in the king’s
name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles.”

The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet, which still
remained overcast.

“Ah! then,” said he, “perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes?”

“I do not know whither I am setting out, monseigneur.”

“But,” said Madame Fouquet, recovered from her fright, “you are not
going so soon, monsieur le capitaine, as not to do us the honor to take
a seat with us?”

“Madame, I should esteem that a great honor done me, but I am so
pressed for time, that, you see, I have been obliged to permit myself to
interrupt your repast to procure payment of my note.”

“The reply to which shall be gold,” said Fouquet, making a sign to his
intendant, who went out with the order D’Artagnan handed him.

“Oh!” said the latter, “I was not uneasy about the payment; the house is
good.”

A painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet.

“Are you in pain?” asked Madame de Belliere.

“Do you feel your attack coming on?” asked Madame Fouquet.

“Neither, thank you both,” said Fouquet.

“Your attack?” said D’Artagnan, in his turn; “are you unwell,
monseigneur?”

“I have a tertian fever, which seized me after the _fete_ at Vaux.”

“Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?”

“No, no; nothing but agitation, that was all.”

“The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king,”
 said La Fontaine, quietly, without suspicion that he was uttering a
sacrilege.

“We cannot devote too much heart to the reception of our king,” said
Fouquet, mildly, to his poet.

“Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor,” interrupted D’Artagnan,
with perfect frankness and much amenity. “The fact is, monseigneur, that
hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux.”

Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet
had conducted himself well towards the king, the king had hardly done
the like to the minister. But D’Artagnan knew the terrible secret. He
alone with Fouquet knew it; those two men had not, the one the courage
to complain, the other the right to accuse. The captain, to whom the
two hundred pistoles were brought, was about to take his leave, when
Fouquet, rising, took a glass of wine, and ordered one to be given to
D’Artagnan.

“Monsieur,” said he, “to the health of the king, _whatever may happen_.”

“And to your health, monseigneur, _whatever may happen_,” said
D’Artagnan.

He bowed, with these words of evil omen, to all the company, who rose as
soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the
stairs.

“I, for a moment, thought it was I and not my money he wanted,” said
Fouquet, endeavoring to laugh.

“You!” cried his friends; “and what for, in the name of Heaven!”

“Oh! do not deceive yourselves, my dear brothers in Epicurus,” said the
superintendent; “I do not wish to make a comparison between the most
humble sinner on the earth, and the God we adore, but remember, he gave
one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper, and
which was nothing but a farewell dinner, like that which we are making
at this moment.”

A painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table. “Shut the
doors,” said Fouquet, and the servants disappeared. “My friends,”
 continued Fouquet, lowering his voice, “what was I formerly? What am
I now? Consult among yourselves and reply. A man like me sinks when
he does not continue to rise. What shall we say, then, when he really
sinks? I have no more money, no more credit; I have no longer anything
but powerful enemies, and powerless friends.”

“Quick!” cried Pelisson. “Since you explain yourself with such
frankness, it is our duty to be frank, likewise. Yes, you are
ruined--yes, you are hastening to your ruin--stop. And, in the first
place, what money have we left?”

“Seven hundred thousand livres,” said the intendant.

“Bread,” murmured Madame Fouquet.

“Relays,” said Pelisson, “relays, and fly!”

“Whither?”

“To Switzerland--to Savoy--but fly!”

“If monseigneur flies,” said Madame Belliere, “it will be said that he
was guilty--was afraid.”

“More than that, it will be said that I have carried away twenty
millions with me.”

“We will draw up memoirs to justify you,” said La Fontaine. “Fly!”

“I will remain,” said Fouquet. “And, besides, does not everything serve
me?”

“You have Belle-Isle,” cried the Abbe Fouquet.

“And I am naturally going there, when going to Nantes,” replied the
superintendent. “Patience, then, patience!”

“Before arriving at Nantes, what a distance!” said Madame Fouquet.

“Yes, I know that well,” replied Fouquet. “But what is to be done there?
The king summons me to the States. I know well it is for the purpose of
ruining me; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness.”

“Well, I have discovered the means of reconciling everything,” cried
Pelisson. “You are going to set out for Nantes.”

Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise.

“But with friends; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans; in your
own barge as far as Nantes; always ready to defend yourself, if you are
attacked; to escape, if you are threatened. In fact, you will carry your
money against all chances; and, whilst flying, you will only have obeyed
the king; then, reaching the sea, when you like, you will embark for
Belle-Isle, and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may
please you, like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven
from its eyrie.”

A general assent followed Pelisson’s words. “Yes, do so,” said Madame
Fouquet to her husband.

“Do so,” said Madame de Belliere.

“Do it! do it!” cried all his friends.

“I will do so,” replied Fouquet.

“This very evening?”

“In an hour?”

“Instantly.”

“With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of
another fortune,” said the Abbe Fouquet.

“What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle?”

“And, if necessary, we will go and discover a new world,” added La
Fontaine, intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm.

A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope. “A courier
from the king,” said the master of the ceremonies.

A profound silence immediately ensued, as if the message brought by this
courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a
moment before. Every one waited to see what the master would do. His
brow was streaming with perspiration, and he was really suffering from
his fever at that instant. He passed into his cabinet, to receive the
king’s message. There prevailed, as we have said, such a silence in the
chambers, and throughout the attendance, that from the dining-room could
be heard the voice of Fouquet, saying, “That is well, monsieur.” This
voice was, however, broken by fatigue, and trembled with emotion. An
instant after, Fouquet called Gourville, who crossed the gallery amidst
the universal expectation. At length, he himself re-appeared among his
guests; but it was no longer the same pale, spiritless countenance they
had beheld when he left them; from pale he had become livid; and from
spiritless, annihilated. A breathing, living specter, he advanced with
his arms stretched out, his mouth parched, like a shade that comes to
salute the friends of former days. On seeing him thus, every one cried
out, and every one rushed towards Fouquet. The latter, looking at
Pelisson, leaned upon his wife, and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise
de Belliere.

“Well,” said he, in a voice which had nothing human in it.

“What has happened, my God!” said some one to him.

Fouquet opened his right hand, which was clenched, but glistening
with perspiration, and displayed a paper, upon which Pelisson cast a
terrified glance. He read the following lines, written by the king’s
hand:

“‘DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET,--Give us, upon that which you
have left of ours, the sum of seven hundred thousand livres, of which we
stand in need to prepare for our departure.

“‘And, as we know your health is not good, we pray God to restore you,
and to have you in His holy keeping. “‘LOUIS.

“‘The present letter is to serve as a receipt.’”

A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment.

“Well,” cried Pelisson, in his turn, “you have received that letter?”

“Received it, yes!”

“What will you do, then?”

“Nothing, since I have received it.”

“But--”

“If I have received it, Pelisson, I have paid it,” said the
surintendant, with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present.

“You have paid it!” cried Madame Fouquet. “Then we are ruined!”

“Come, no useless words,” interrupted Pelisson. “Next to money, life.
Monseigneur, to horse! to horse!”

“What, leave us!” at once cried both the women, wild with grief.

“Eh! monseigneur, in saving yourself, you save us all. To horse!”

“But he cannot hold himself on. Look at him.”

“Oh! if he takes time to reflect--” said the intrepid Pelisson.

“He is right,” murmured Fouquet.

“Monseigneur! Monseigneur!” cried Gourville, rushing up the stairs, four
steps at once. “Monseigneur!”

“Well! what?”

“I escorted, as you desired, the king’s courier with the money.”

“Yes.”

“Well! when I arrived at the Palais Royal, I saw--”

“Take breath, my poor friend, take breath; you are suffocating.”

“What did you see?” cried the impatient friends.

“I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback,” said Gourville.

“There, then!” cried every voice at once; “there, then! is there an
instant to be lost?”

Madame Fouquet rushed downstairs, calling for her horses; Madame de
Belliere flew after her, catching her in her arms, and saying: “Madame,
in the name of his safety, do not betray anything, do not manifest
alarm.”

Pelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages. And, in the
meantime, Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends
were able to throw into it of gold and silver--the last offering, the
pious alms made to misery by poverty. The surintendant, dragged along by
some, carried by others, was shut up in his carriage. Gourville took the
reins, and mounted the box. Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet, who had
fainted. Madame de Belliere had more strength, and was well paid for
it; she received Fouquet’s last kiss. Pelisson easily explained this
precipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned
the minister to Nantes.



Chapter XXXVI. In M. Colbert’s Carriage.

As Gourville had seen, the king’s musketeers were mounting and following
their captain. The latter, who did not like to be confined in his
proceedings, left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant, and set
off on post horses, recommending his men to use all diligence. However
rapidly they might travel, they could not arrive before him. He had
time, in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs, to see something
which afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture. He saw M.
Colbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage, which was
stationed before the door. In this carriage D’Artagnan perceived the
hoods of two women, and being rather curious, he wished to know the
names of the ladies hid beneath these hoods. To get a glimpse at them,
for they kept themselves closely covered up, he urged his horse so near
the carriage, that he drove him against the step with such force as to
shake everything containing and contained. The terrified women uttered,
the one a faint cry, by which D’Artagnan recognized a young woman, the
other an imprecation, in which he recognized the vigor and _aplomb_ that
half a century bestows. The hoods were thrown back: one of the women
was Madame Vanel, the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse. D’Artagnan’s
eyes were quicker than those of the ladies; he had seen and known them,
whilst they did not recognize him; and as they laughed at their fright,
pressing each other’s hands,--

“Humph!” said D’Artagnan, “the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to
friendship than formerly. _She_ paying her court to the mistress of M.
Colbert! Poor M. Fouquet! that presages you nothing good!”

He rode on. M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio
commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes.
Madame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband’s house, and,
left alone with M. Colbert, chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her
ride. She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation, that dear duchesse,
and as she always talked for the ill of others, though ever with a view
to her own good, her conversation amused her interlocutor, and did not
fail to leave a favorable impression.

She taught Colbert, who, poor man! was ignorant of the fact, how great
a minister he was, and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher. She
promised to rally around him, when he should become surintendant,
all the old nobility of the kingdom, and questioned him as to the
preponderance it would be proper to allow La Valliere. She praised him,
she blamed him, she bewildered him. She showed him the secret of so many
secrets that, for a moment, Colbert thought he was doing business with
the devil. She proved to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of
to-day, as she had held the Fouquet of yesterday; and as he asked her
very simply the reason of her hatred for the surintendant: “Why do you
yourself hate him?” said she.

“Madame, in politics,” replied he, “the differences of system oft bring
about dissentions between men. M. Fouquet always appeared to me to
practice a system opposed to the true interests of the king.”

She interrupted him.--“I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet. The
journey the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account of
him. M. Fouquet, for me, is a man gone by--and for you also.”

Colbert made no reply. “On his return from Nantes,” continued the
duchesse, “the king, who is only anxious for a pretext, will find
that the States have not behaved well--that they have made too few
sacrifices. The States will say that the imposts are too heavy, and that
the surintendant has ruined them. The king will lay all the blame on M.
Fouquet, and then--”

“And then?” said Colbert.

“Oh! he will be disgraced. Is not that your opinion?”

Colbert darted a glance at the duchesse, which plainly said: “If M.
Fouquet be only disgraced, you will not be the cause of it.”

“Your place, M. Colbert,” the duchesse hastened to say, “must be a high
place. Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself, after the
fall of M. Fouquet?”

“I do not understand,” said he.

“You _will_ understand. To what does your ambition aspire?”

“I have none.”

“It was useless, then, to overthrow the superintendent, Monsieur
Colbert. It was idle.”

“I had the honor to tell you, madame--”

“Oh! yes, I know, all about the interest of the king--but, if you
please, we will speak of your own.”

“Mine! that is to say, the affairs of his majesty.”

“In short, are you, or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet?
Answer without evasion.”

“Madame, I ruin nobody.”

“I am endeavoring to comprehend, then, why you purchased from me the
letters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet. Neither can I conceive why
you have laid those letters before the king.”

Colbert, half stupefied, looked at the duchesse with an air of
constraint.

“Madame,” said he, “I can less easily conceive how you, who received the
money, can reproach me on that head--”

“That is,” said the old duchesse, “because we must will that which we
wish for, unless we are not able to obtain what we wish.”

“_Will!_” said Colbert, quite confounded by such coarse logic.

“You are not able, _hein!_ Speak.”

“I am not able, I allow, to destroy certain influences near the king.”

“That fight in favor of M. Fouquet? What are they? Stop, let me help
you.”

“Do, madame.”

“La Valliere?”

“Oh! very little influence; no knowledge of business, and small means.
M. Fouquet has paid his court to her.”

“To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?”

“I think it would.”

“There is still another influence, what do you say to that?”

“Is it considerable?”

“The queen-mother, perhaps?”

“Her majesty, the queen-mother, has a weakness for M. Fouquet very
prejudicial to her son.”

“Never believe that,” said the old duchesse, smiling.

“Oh!” said Colbert, with incredulity, “I have often experienced it.”

“Formerly?”

“Very recently, madame, at Vaux. It was she who prevented the king from
having M. Fouquet arrested.”

“People do not forever entertain the same opinions, my dear monsieur.
That which the queen may have wished recently, she would not wish,
perhaps, to-day.”

“And why not?” said Colbert, astonished.

“Oh! the reason is of very little consequence.”

“On the contrary, I think it is of great consequence; for, if I were
certain of not displeasing her majesty, the queen-mother, my scruples
would be all removed.”

“Well! have you never heard talk of a certain secret?”

“A secret?”

“Call it what you like. In short, the queen-mother has conceived a
bitter hatred for all those who have participated, in one fashion or
another, in the discovery of this secret, and M. Fouquet I believe is
one of these.”

“Then,” said Colbert, “we may be sure of the assent of the
queen-mother?”

“I have just left her majesty, and she assures me so.”

“So be it, then, madame.”

“But there is something further; do you happen to know a man who was the
intimate friend of M. Fouquet, M. d’Herblay, a bishop, I believe?”

“Bishop of Vannes.”

“Well! this M. d’Herblay, who also knew the secret, the queen-mother is
pursuing with the utmost rancor.”

“Indeed!”

“So hotly pursued, that if he were dead, she would not be satisfied with
anything less than his head, to satisfy her he would never speak again.”

“And is that the desire of the queen-mother?”

“An order is given for it.”

“This Monsieur d’Herblay shall be sought for, madame.”

“Oh! it is well known where he is.”

Colbert looked at the duchesse.

“Say where, madame.”

“He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer.”

“At the residence of M. Fouquet?”

“At the residence of M. Fouquet.”

“He shall be taken.”

It was now the duchesse’s turn to smile. “Do not fancy the capture so
easy,” said she; “do not promise it so lightly.”

“Why not, madame?”

“Because M. d’Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when
and where you please.”

“He is a rebel, then?”

“Oh! Monsieur Colbert, we have passed all our lives in making rebels,
and yet you see plainly, that so far from being taken, we take others.”

Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which
no words can convey the expression, accompanied by a firmness not
altogether wanting in grandeur. “The times are gone,” said he, “in which
subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France. If M.
d’Herblay conspires, he will perish on the scaffold. That will give, or
will not give, pleasure to his enemies,--a matter, by the way, of little
importance to _us_.”

And this _us_, a strange word in the mouth of Colbert, made the duchesse
thoughtful for a moment. She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this
man--Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation, and he
meant to keep it.

“You ask me, madame,” he said, “to have this M. d’Herblay arrested?”

“I?--I ask you nothing of the kind!”

“I thought you did, madame. But as I have been mistaken, we will leave
him alone; the king has said nothing about him.”

The duchesse bit her nails.

“Besides,” continued Colbert, “what a poor capture would this bishop be!
A bishop game for a king! Oh! no, no; I will not even take the slightest
notice of him.”

The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself.

“Game for a woman!” said she. “Is not the queen a woman? If she wishes
M. d’Herblay arrested, she has her reasons. Besides, is not M. d’Herblay
the friend of him who is doomed to fall?”

“Oh! never mind that,” said Colbert. “This man shall be spared, if he is
not the enemy of the king. Is that displeasing to you?”

“I say nothing.”

“Yes--you wish to see him in prison, in the Bastile, for instance.”

“I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile
than behind those of Belle-Isle.”

“I will speak to the king about it; he will clear up the point.”

“And whilst waiting for that enlightenment, Monsieur l’Eveque de Vannes
will have escaped. I would do so.”

“Escaped! he! and whither should he escape? Europe is ours, in will, if
not in fact.”

“He will always find an asylum, monsieur. It is evident you know nothing
of the man you have to do with. You do not know D’Herblay; you do not
know Aramis. He was one of those four musketeers who, under the late
king, made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble, and who, during the regency,
gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin.”

“But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?”

“He has one, monsieur.”

“A kingdom, he! what, Monsieur d’Herblay?”

“I repeat to you, monsieur, that if he wants a kingdom, he either has it
or will have it.”

“Well, as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape, madame,
I promise you he shall not escape.”

“Belle-Isle is fortified, M. Colbert, and fortified by him.”

“If Belle-Isle were also defended by him, Belle-Isle is not impregnable;
and if Monsieur l’Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle, well,
madame, the place shall be besieged, and he will be taken.”

“You may be very certain, monsieur, that the zeal you display in the
interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily, and
you will be magnificently rewarded; but what shall I tell her of your
projects respecting this man?”

“That when once taken, he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her
secret shall never escape.”

“Very well, Monsieur Colbert, and we may say, that, dating from this
instant, we have formed a solid alliance, that is, you and I, and that I
am absolutely at your service.”

“It is I, madame, who place myself at yours. This Chevalier d’Herblay is
a kind of Spanish spy, is he not?”

“Much more.”

“A secret ambassador?”

“Higher still.”

“Stop--King Phillip III. of Spain is a bigot. He is, perhaps, the
confessor of Phillip III.”

“You must go higher even than that.”

“_Mordieu!_” cried Colbert, who forgot himself so far as to swear in the
presence of this great lady, of this old friend of the queen-mother. “He
must then be the general of the Jesuits.”

“I believe you have guessed it at last,” replied the duchesse.

“Ah! then, madame, this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him; and
we must make haste, too.”

“Such was my opinion, monsieur, but I did not dare to give it you.”

“And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne, and not us.”

“But, mark this well, M. Colbert. M. d’Herblay is never discouraged; if
he has missed one blow, he will be sure to make another; he will begin
again. If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for
himself, sooner or later, he will make another, of whom, to a certainty,
you will not be prime minister.”

Colbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression. “I feel assured
that a prison will settle this affair for us, madame, in a manner
satisfactory for both.”

The duchesse smiled again.

“Oh! if you knew,” said she, “how many times Aramis has got out of
prison!”

“Oh!” replied Colbert, “we will take care that he shall not get out
_this_ time.”

“But you were not attending to what I said to you just now. Do you
remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so
dreaded? And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession
of that which they have now--money and experience.”

Colbert bit his lips.

“We will renounce the idea of the prison,” said he, in a lower tone:
“we will find a little retreat from which the invincible cannot possibly
escape.”

“That was well spoken, our ally!” replied the duchesse. “But it is
getting late; had we not better return?”

“The more willingly, madame, from my having my preparations to make for
setting out with the king.”

“To Paris!” cried the duchesse to the coachman.

And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine, after the
conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet,
the last defender of Belle-Isle, the former friend of Marie Michon, the
new foe of the old duchesse.



Chapter XXXVII. The Two Lighters.

D’Artagnan had set off; Fouquet likewise was gone, and with a rapidity
which doubled the tender interest of his friends. The first moments of
this journey, or better say, this flight, were troubled by a ceaseless
dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive. It was
not natural, in fact, if Louis XIV. was determined to seize this prey,
that he should allow it to escape; the young lion was already accustomed
to the chase, and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted.
But insensibly all fears were dispersed; the surintendant, by hard
traveling, placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors,
that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him. As
to his position, his friends had made it excellent for him. Was he not
traveling to join the king at Nantes, and what did the rapidity prove
but his zeal to obey? He arrived, fatigued, but reassured, at Orleans,
where he found, thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him,
a handsome lighter of eight oars. These lighters, in the shape of
gondolas, somewhat wide and heavy, containing a small chamber, covered
by the deck, and a chamber in the poop, formed by a tent, then acted as
passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes, by the Loire, and this passage,
a long one in our days, appeared then more easy and convenient than the
high-road, with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages. Fouquet went
on board this lighter, which set out immediately. The rowers, knowing
they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances, pulled
with all their strength, and that magic word, the _finances_, promised
them a liberal gratification, of which they wished to prove themselves
worthy. The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire.
Magnificent weather, a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape,
displayed the river in all its limpid serenity. The current and the
rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird, and he arrived
before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the
voyage. Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes; there he
would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of
the States; he would make himself a necessity, a thing very easy for a
man of his merit, and would delay the catastrophe, if he did not succeed
in avoiding it entirely. “Besides,” said Gourville to him, “at Nantes,
you will make out, or we will make out, the intentions of your enemies;
we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou, a bark in
which to gain the sea, and when once upon the open sea, Belle-Isle is
your inviolable port. You see, besides, that no one is watching you, no
one is following.” He had scarcely finished when they discovered at
a distance, behind an elbow formed by the river, the masts of a huge
lighter coming down. The rowers of Fouquet’s boat uttered a cry of
surprise on seeing this galley.

“What is the matter?” asked Fouquet.

“The matter is, monseigneur,” replied the patron of the bark, “that it
is a truly remarkable thing--that lighter comes along like a hurricane.”

Gourville started, and mounted to the deck, in order to obtain a better
view.

Fouquet did not go up with him, but said to Gourville, with restrained
mistrust: “See what it is, dear friend.”

The lighter had just passed the elbow. It came on so fast, that behind
it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the
day.

“How they go,” repeated the skipper, “how they go! They must be well
paid! I did not think,” he added, “that oars of wood could behave better
than ours, but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary.”

“Well they may,” said one of the rowers, “they are twelve, and we but
eight.”

“Twelve rowers!” replied Gourville, “twelve! impossible.”

The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded, even
for the king. This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant, more
for the sake of haste than of respect.

“What does it mean?” said Gourville, endeavoring to distinguish beneath
the tent, which was already apparent, travelers which the most piercing
eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering.

“They must be in a hurry, for it is not the king,” said the patron.

Fouquet shuddered.

“By what sign do you know that it is not the king?” said Gourville.

“In the first place, because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis,
which the royal lighter always carries.”

“And then,” said Fouquet, “because it is impossible it should be the
king, Gourville, as the king was still in Paris yesterday.”

Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said: “You were
there yourself yesterday.”

“And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste?” added he, for
the sake of gaining time.

“By this, monsieur,” said the patron; “these people must have set out a
long while after us, and they have already nearly overtaken us.”

“Bah!” said Gourville, “who told you that they do not come from
Beaugency or from Moit even?”

“We have seen no lighter of that shape, except at Orleans. It comes from
Orleans, monsieur, and makes great haste.”

Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance. The captain remarked their
uneasiness, and, to mislead him, Gourville immediately said:

“Some friend, who has laid a wager he would catch us; let us win the
wager, and not allow him to come up with us.”

The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible, but
Fouquet said with much _hauteur_,--“If it is any one who wishes to
overtake us, let him come.”

“We can try, monseigneur,” said the man, timidly. “Come, you fellows,
put out your strength; row, row!”

“No,” said Fouquet, “on the contrary; stop short.”

“Monseigneur! what folly!” interrupted Gourville, stooping towards his
ear.

“Pull up!” repeated Fouquet. The eight oars stopped, and resisting the
water, created a retrograde motion. It stopped. The twelve rowers in the
other did not, at first, perceive this maneuver, for they continued
to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within
musket-shot. Fouquet was short-sighted, Gourville was annoyed by the
sun, now full in his eyes; the skipper alone, with that habit and
clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements,
perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter.

“I can see them!” cried he; “there are two.”

“I can see nothing,” said Gourville.

“You will not be long before you distinguish them; in twenty strokes of
their oars they will be within ten paces of us.”

But what the patron announced was not realized; the lighter imitated
the movement commanded by Fouquet, and instead of coming to join its
pretended friends, it stopped short in the middle of the river.

“I cannot comprehend this,” said the captain.

“Nor I,” cried Gourville.

“You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter,” resumed
Fouquet, “try to describe them to us, before we are too far off.”

“I thought I saw two,” replied the boatman. “I can only see one now,
under the tent.”

“What sort of man is he?”

“He is a dark man, broad-shouldered, bull-necked.”

A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure, darkening the
sun. Gourville, who was still looking, with one hand over his eyes,
became able to see what he sought, and all at once, jumping from the
deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him: “Colbert!” said he, in
a voice broken by emotion.

“Colbert!” repeated Fouquet. “Too strange! but no, it is impossible!”

“I tell you I recognized him, and he, at the same time, so plainly
recognized me, that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop.
Perhaps the king has sent him on our track.”

“In that case he would join us, instead of lying by. What is he doing
there?”

“He is watching us, without a doubt.”

“I do not like uncertainty,” said Fouquet; “let us go straight up to
him.”

“Oh! monseigneur, do not do that, the lighter is full of armed men.”

“He wishes to arrest me, then, Gourville? Why does he not come on?”

“Monseigneur, it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even
your ruin.”

“But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor!”

“Nothing yet proves that they are watching you, monseigneur; be
patient!”

“What is to be done, then?”

“Do not stop; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king’s
order with zeal. Redouble the speed. He who lives will see!”

“That is better. Come!” cried Fouquet; “since they remain stock-still
yonder, let us go on.”

The captain gave the signal, and Fouquet’s rowers resumed their task
with all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested.
Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms, than the other, that
with the twelve rowers, resumed its rapid course. This position lasted
all day, without any increase or diminution of distance between the two
vessels. Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his
persecutor. He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore, as if to
effect a landing. Colbert’s lighter imitated this maneuver, and steered
towards the shore in a slanting direction. By the merest chance, at
the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land, a stableman, from
the chateau of Langeais, was following the flowery banks leading three
horses in halters. Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter
fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready
for flight, for four or five men, armed with muskets, jumped from the
lighter on to the shore, and marched along the banks, as if to gain
ground on the horseman. Fouquet, satisfied of having forced the enemy to
a demonstration, considered his intention evident, and put his boat
in motion again. Colbert’s people returned likewise to theirs, and the
course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance. Upon
seeing this, Fouquet felt himself threatened closely, and in a prophetic
voice--“Well, Gourville,” said he, whisperingly, “what did I say at our
last repast, at my house? Am I going, or not, to my ruin?”

“Oh! monseigneur!”

“These two boats, which follow each other with so much emulation, as if
we were disputing, M. Colbert and I, a prize for swiftness on the
Loire, do they not aptly represent our fortunes; and do you not believe,
Gourville, that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes?”

“At least,” objected Gourville, “there is still uncertainty; you are
about to appear at the States; you are about to show what sort of man
you are; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and
sword that will serve to defend you, if not to conquer with. The Bretons
do not know you; and when they become acquainted with you your cause
is won! Oh! let M. Colbert look to it well, for his lighter is as much
exposed as yours to being upset. Both go quickly, his faster than yours,
it is true; we shall see which will be wrecked first.”

Fouquet, taking Gourville’s hand--“My friend,” said he, “everything
considered, remember the proverb, ‘First come, first served!’ Well! M.
Colbert takes care not to pass me. He is a prudent man is M. Colbert.”

He was right; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes,
watching each other. When the surintendant landed, Gourville hoped he
should be able to seek refuge at once, and have the relays prepared.
But, at the landing, the second lighter joined the first, and Colbert,
approaching Fouquet, saluted him on the quay with marks of the
profoundest respect--marks so significant, so public, that their result
was the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse. Fouquet was
completely self-possessed; he felt that in his last moments of greatness
he had obligations towards himself. He wished to fall from such a height
that his fall should crush some of his enemies. Colbert was there--so
much the worse for Colbert. The surintendant, therefore, coming up to
him, replied, with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to
him--“What! is that you, M. Colbert?”

“To offer you my respects, monseigneur,” said the latter.

“Were you in that lighter?”--pointing to the one with twelve rowers.

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“Of twelve rowers?” said Fouquet; “what luxury, M. Colbert. For a moment
I thought it was the queen-mother.”

“Monseigneur!”--and Colbert blushed.

“This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it
dear, Monsieur l’Intendant!” said Fouquet. “But you have, happily,
arrived!--You see, however,” added he, a moment after, “that I, who had
but eight rowers, arrived before you.” And he turned his back towards
him, leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter
had escaped the notice of the first. At least he did not give him
the satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened. Colbert, so
annoyingly attacked, did not give way.

“I have not been quick, monseigneur,” he replied, “because I followed
your example whenever you stopped.”

“And why did you do that, Monsieur Colbert?” cried Fouquet, irritated by
the base audacity; “as you had a superior crew to mine, why did you not
either join me or pass me?”

“Out of respect,” said the intendant, bowing to the ground.

Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him, we know not
why or how, and he repaired to _la Maison de Nantes_, escorted by a vast
crowd of people, who for several days had been agog with expectation of
a convocation of the States. Scarcely was he installed when Gourville
went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes, and a boat
at Paimboef. He performed these various operations with so much mystery,
activity, and generosity, that never was Fouquet, then laboring under an
attack of fever, more nearly saved, except for the counteraction of that
immense disturber of human projects,--chance. A report was spread during
the night, that the king was coming in great haste on post horses, and
would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest. The people, while
waiting for the king, were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers, newly
arrived, with Monsieur d’Artagnan, their captain, and quartered in the
castle, of which they occupied all the posts, in quality of guard of
honor. M. d’Artagnan, who was very polite, presented himself, about
ten o’clock, at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful
compliments; and although the minister suffered from fever, although
he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat, he would receive M.
d’Artagnan, who was delighted with that honor, as will be seen by the
conversation they had together.



Chapter XXXVIII. Friendly Advice.

Fouquet had gone to bed, like a man who clings to life, and wishes to
economize, as much as possible, that slender tissue of existence, of
which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the
tenuity. D’Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber, and was
saluted by the superintendent with a very affable “Good day.”

“_Bon jour!_ monseigneur,” replied the musketeer; “how did you get
through the journey?”

“Tolerably well, thank you.”

“And the fever?”

“But poorly. I drink, as you perceive. I am scarcely arrived, and I have
already levied a contribution of _tisane_ upon Nantes.”

“You should sleep first, monseigneur.”

“Eh! _corbleu!_ my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, I should be very glad to
sleep.”

“Who hinders you?”

“Why, _you_ in the first place.”

“I? Oh, monseigneur!”

“No doubt you do. Is it at Nantes as at Paris? Do you not come in the
king’s name?”

“For Heaven’s sake, monseigneur,” replied the captain, “leave the king
alone! The day on which I shall come on the part of the king, for the
purpose you mean, take my word for it, I will not leave you long in
doubt. You will see me place my hand on my sword, according to the
_ordonnance_, and you will hear my say at once, in ceremonial voice,
‘Monseigneur, in the name of the king, I arrest you!’”

“You promise me that frankness?” said the superintendent.

“Upon my honor! But we have not come to that, believe me.”

“What makes you think that, M. d’Artagnan? For my part, I think quite
the contrary.”

“I have heard speak of nothing of the kind,” replied D’Artagnan.

“Eh! eh!” said Fouquet.

“Indeed, no. You are an agreeable man, in spite of your fever. The king
should not, cannot help loving you, at the bottom of his heart.”

Fouquet’s expression implied doubt. “But M. Colbert?” said he; “does M.
Colbert love me as much as you say?”

“I am not speaking of M. Colbert,” replied D’Artagnan. “He is an
exceptional man. He does not love you; so much is very possible; but,
_mordioux!_ the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very
little trouble.”

“Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?” replied
Fouquet; “and that, upon my life! I have never met with a man of your
intelligence, and heart?”

“You are pleased to say so,” replied D’Artagnan. “Why did you wait till
to-day to pay me such a compliment?”

“Blind that we are!” murmured Fouquet.

“Your voice is getting hoarse,” said D’Artagnan; “drink, monseigneur,
drink!” And he offered him a cup of _tisane_, with the most friendly
cordiality; Fouquet took it, and thanked him by a gentle smile. “Such
things only happen to me,” said the musketeer. “I have passed ten years
under your very beard, while you were rolling about tons of gold. You
were clearing an annual pension of four millions; you never observed me;
and you find out there is such a person in the world, just at the moment
you--”

“Just at the moment I am about to fall,” interrupted Fouquet. “That is
true, my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan.”

“I did not say so.”

“But you thought so; and that is the same thing. Well! if I fall,
take my word as truth, I shall not pass a single day without saying
to myself, as I strike my brow, ‘Fool! fool!--stupid mortal! You had a
Monsieur d’Artagnan under your eye and hand, and you did not employ him,
you did not enrich him!’”

“You overwhelm me,” said the captain. “I esteem you greatly.”

“There exists another man, then, who does not think as M. Colbert
thinks,” said the surintendant.

“How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination! He is worse than
fever!”

“Oh! I have good cause,” said Fouquet. “Judge for yourself.” And he
related the details of the course of the lighters, and the hypocritical
persecution of Colbert. “Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?”

D’Artagnan became very serious. “That is true,” he said. “Yes; it has
an unsavory odor, as M. de Treville used to say.” And he fixed on M.
Fouquet his intelligent and significant look.

“Am I not clearly designated in that, captain? Is not the king bringing
me to Nantes to get me away from Paris, where I have so many creatures,
and to possess himself of Belle-Isle?”

“Where M. d’Herblay is,” added D’Artagnan. Fouquet raised his head. “As
for me, monseigneur,” continued D’Artagnan, “I can assure you the king
has said nothing to me against you.”

“Indeed!”

“The king commanded me to set out for Nantes, it is true; and to say
nothing about it to M. de Gesvres.”

“My friend.”

“To M. de Gesvres, yes, monseigneur,” continued the musketeer, whose eye
s did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his
lips. “The king, moreover, commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers,
which is apparently superfluous, as the country is quite quiet.”

“A brigade!” said Fouquet, raising himself upon his elbow.

“Ninety-six horsemen, yes, monseigneur. The same number as were employed
in arresting MM. de Chalais, de Cinq-Mars, and Montmorency.”

Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words, pronounced without apparent
value. “And what else?” said he.

“Oh! nothing but insignificant orders; such as guarding the castle,
guarding every lodging, allowing none of M. de Gesvres’s guards to
occupy a single post.”

“And as to myself,” cried Fouquet, “what orders had you?”

“As to you, monseigneur?--not the smallest word.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan, my safety, my honor, perhaps my life are at stake.
You would not deceive me?”

“I?--to what end? Are you threatened? Only there really is an order with
respect to carriages and boats--”

“An order?”

“Yes; but it cannot concern you--a simple measure of police.”

“What is it, captain?--what is it?”

“To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes, without a pass, signed
by the king.”

“Great God! but--”

D’Artagnan began to laugh. “All that is not to be put into execution
before the arrival of the king at Nantes. So that you see plainly,
monseigneur, the order in nowise concerns you.”

Fouquet became thoughtful, and D’Artagnan feigned not to observe his
preoccupation. “It is evident, by my thus confiding to you the orders
which have been given to me, that I am friendly towards you, and that I
am trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you.”

“Without doubt!--without doubt!” said Fouquet, still absent.

“Let us recapitulate,” said the captain, his glance beaming with
earnestness. “A special guard about the castle, in which your lodging is
to be, is it not?”

“Do you know the castle?”

“Ah! monseigneur, a regular prison! The absence of M. de Gesvres, who
has the honor of being one of your friends. The closing of the gates of
the city, and of the river without a pass; but, only when the king shall
have arrived. Please to observe, Monsieur Fouquet, that if, instead of
speaking to man like you, who are one of the first in the kingdom, I
were speaking to a troubled, uneasy conscience--I should compromise
myself forever. What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be
free! No police, no guards, no orders; the water free, the roads free,
Monsieur d’Artagnan obliged to lend his horses, if required. All this
ought to reassure you, Monsieur Fouquet, for the king would not have
left me thus independent, if he had any sinister designs. In truth,
Monsieur Fouquet, ask me whatever you like, I am at your service; and,
in return, if you will consent to do it, do me a service, that of giving
my compliments to Aramis and Porthos, in case you embark for Belle-Isle,
as you have a right to do without changing your dress, immediately, in
your _robe de chambre_--just as you are.” Saying these words, and with
a profound bow, the musketeer, whose looks had lost none of their
intelligent kindness, left the apartment. He had not reached the steps
of the vestibule, when Fouquet, quite beside himself, hung to the
bell-rope, and shouted, “My horses!--my lighter!” But nobody answered.
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand.

“Gourville!--Gourville!” cried he, while slipping his watch into
his pocket. And the bell sounded again, whilst Fouquet repeated,
“Gourville!--Gourville!”

Gourville at length appeared, breathless and pale.

“Let us be gone! Let us be gone!” cried Fouquet, as soon as he saw him.

“It is too late!” said the surintendant’s poor friend.

“Too late!--why?”

“Listen!” And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of
the castle.

“What does that mean, Gourville?”

“It means the king is come, monseigneur.”

“The king!”

“The king, who has ridden double stages, who has killed horses, and who
is eight hours in advance of all our calculations.”

“We are lost!” murmured Fouquet. “Brave D’Artagnan, all is over, thou
has spoken to me too late!”

The king, in fact, was entering the city, which soon resounded with the
cannon from the ramparts, and from a vessel which replied from the lower
parts of the river. Fouquet’s brow darkened; he called his _valets de
chambre_ and dressed in ceremonial costume. From his window, behind the
curtains, he could see the eagerness of the people, and the movement of
a large troop, which had followed the prince. The king was conducted
to the castle with great pomp, and Fouquet saw him dismount under the
portcullis, and say something in the ear of D’Artagnan, who held his
stirrup. D’Artagnan, when the king had passed under the arch, directed
his steps towards the house Fouquet was in; but so slowly, and stopping
so frequently to speak to his musketeers, drawn up like a hedge, that
it might be said he was counting the seconds, or the steps, before
accomplishing his object. Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in
the court.

“Ah!” cried D’Artagnan, on perceiving him, “are you still there,
monseigneur?”

And that word _still_ completed the proof to Fouquet of how much
information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first
visit the musketeer had paid him. The surintendant sighed deeply.
“Good heavens! yes, monsieur,” replied he. “The arrival of the king has
interrupted me in the projects I had formed.”

“Oh, then you know that the king has arrived?”

“Yes, monsieur, I have seen him; and this time you come from him--”

“To inquire after you, monseigneur; and, if your health is not too bad,
to beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle.”

“Directly, Monsieur d’Artagnan, directly!”

“Ah, _mordioux!_” said the captain, “now the king is come, there is no
more walking for anybody--no more free will; the password governs all
now, you as much as me, me as much as you.”

Fouquet heaved a last sigh, climbed with difficulty into his carriage,
so great was his weakness, and went to the castle, escorted by
D’Artagnan, whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it
had just before been consoling and cheerful.



Chapter XXXIX. How the King, Louis XIV., Played His Little Part.

As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage, to enter the castle of
Nantes, a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the
greatest respect, and gave him a letter. D’Artagnan endeavored to
prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet, and pushed him away, but the
message had been given to the surintendant. Fouquet opened the letter
and read it, and instantly a vague terror, which D’Artagnan did not
fail to penetrate, was painted on the countenance of the first minister.
Fouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm, and
passed on towards the king’s apartments. D’Artagnan, through the small
windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs, saw, as he went up
behind Fouquet, the man who had delivered the note, looking round him
on the place and making signs to several persons, who disappeared in the
adjacent streets, after having themselves repeated the signals. Fouquet
was made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken,--a
terrace which abutted on the little corridor, at the end of which the
cabinet of the king was located. Here D’Artagnan passed on before the
surintendant, whom, till that time, he had respectfully accompanied, and
entered the royal cabinet.

“Well?” asked Louis XIV., who, on perceiving him, threw on to the table
covered with papers a large green cloth.

“The order is executed, sire.”

“And Fouquet?”

“Monsieur le surintendant follows me,” said D’Artagnan.

“In ten minutes let him be introduced,” said the king, dismissing
D’Artagnan again with a gesture. The latter retired; but had scarcely
reached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for
him, when he was recalled by the king’s bell.

“Did he not appear astonished?” asked the king.

“Who, sire?”

“_Fouquet_,” replied the king, without saying monsieur, a peculiarity
which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions.

“No, sire,” replied he.

“That’s well!” And a second time Louis dismissed D’Artagnan.

Fouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide.
He reperused his note, conceived thus:

“Something is being contrived against you. Perhaps they will not dare to
carry it out at the castle; it will be on your return home. The house
is already surrounded by musketeers. Do not enter. A white horse is in
waiting for you behind the esplanade!”

Fouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville. Not being willing
that, if any evil happened to himself, this paper should compromise a
faithful friend, the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand
morsels, spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace.
D’Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last
scraps in space.

“Monsieur,” said he, “the king awaits you.”

Fouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor, where
MM. de Brienne and Rose were at work, whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan,
seated on a chair, likewise in the corridor, appeared to be waiting
for orders, with feverish impatience, his sword between his legs. It
appeared strange to Fouquet that MM. Brienne, Rose, and de Saint-Aignan,
in general so attentive and obsequious, should scarcely take the least
notice, as he, the surintendant, passed. But how could he expect to find
it otherwise among courtiers, he whom the king no longer called anything
but _Fouquet?_ He raised his head, determined to look every one and
everything bravely in the face, and entered the king’s apartment, where
a little bell, which we already know, had already announced him to his
majesty.

The king, without rising, nodded to him, and with interest: “Well! how
are you, Monsieur Fouquet?” said he.

“I am in a high fever,” replied the surintendant; “but I am at the
king’s service.”

“That is well; the States assemble to-morrow; have you a speech ready?”

Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment. “I have not, sire,”
 replied he; “but I will improvise one. I am too well acquainted with
affairs to feel any embarrassment. I have only one question to ask; will
your majesty permit me?”

“Certainly. Ask it.”

“Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him
notice of this in Paris?”

“You were ill; I was not willing to fatigue you.”

“Never did a labor--never did an explanation fatigue me, sire; and since
the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king--”

“Oh, Monsieur Fouquet! an explanation? An explanation, pray, of what?”

“Of your majesty’s intentions with respect to myself.”

The king blushed. “I have been calumniated,” continued Fouquet, warmly,
“and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make
inquiries.”

“You say all this to me very uselessly, Monsieur Fouquet; I know what I
know.”

“Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you; and
I, on my part, have said nothing to you, whilst others have spoken many,
many times--”

“What do you wish to say?” said the king, impatient to put an end to
this embarrassing conversation.

“I will go straight to the facts, sire; and I accuse a certain man of
having injured me in your majesty’s opinion.”

“Nobody has injured you, Monsieur Fouquet.”

“That reply proves to me, sire, that I am right.”

“Monsieur Fouquet, I do not like people to be accused.”

“Not when one is accused?”

“We have already spoken too much about this affair.”

“Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself?”

“I repeat that I do not accuse you.”

Fouquet, with a half-bow, made a step backward. “It is certain,” thought
he, “that he has made up his mind. He alone who cannot go back can show
such obstinacy. Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed;
not to shun it would be stupid.” He resumed aloud, “Did your majesty
send for me on business?”

“No, Monsieur Fouquet, but for some advice I wish to give you.”

“I respectfully await it, sire.”

“Rest yourself, Monsieur Fouquet, do not throw away your strength; the
session of the States will be short, and when my secretaries shall
have closed it, I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a
fortnight.”

“Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of
the States?”

“No, Monsieur Fouquet.”

“Not to me, the surintendant of the finances?”

“Rest yourself, I beg you; that is all I have to say to you.”

Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head. He was evidently busy with
some uneasy thought. This uneasiness struck the king. “Are you angry at
having to rest yourself, M. Fouquet?” said he.

“Yes, sire, I am not accustomed to take rest.”

“But you are ill; you must take care of yourself.”

“Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow.”

His majesty made no reply; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him.
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation. He thought he could
read danger in the eyes of the young prince, which fear would but
precipitate. “If I appear frightened, I am lost,” thought he.

The king, on his part, was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet. “Has he
a suspicion of anything?” murmured he.

“If his first word is severe,” again thought Fouquet; “if he becomes
angry, or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext, how shall I
extricate myself? Let us smooth the declivity a little. Gourville was
right.”

“Sire,” said he, suddenly, “since the goodness of the king watches over
my health to the point of dispensing with my labor, may I not be allowed
to be absent from the council of to-morrow? I could pass the day in
bed, and will entreat the king to grant me his physician, that we may
endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever.”

“So be it, Monsieur Fouquet, it shall be as you desire; you shall have
a holiday to-morrow, you shall have the physician, and shall be restored
to health.”

“Thanks!” said Fouquet, bowing. Then, opening his game: “Shall I
not have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of
Belle-Isle?”

And he looked Louis full in the face, to judge of the effect of such a
proposal. The king blushed again.

“Do you know,” replied he, endeavoring to smile, “that you have just
said, ‘My residence of Belle-Isle’?”

“Yes, sire.”

“Well! do you not remember,” continued the king in the same cheerful
tone, “that you gave me Belle-Isle?”

“That is true again, sire. Only, as you have not taken it, you will
doubtless come with me and take possession of it.”

“I mean to do so.”

“That was, besides, your majesty’s intention as well as mine; and I
cannot express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see
all the king’s regiments from Paris to help take possession.”

The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that
alone.

“Oh, I am convinced of that,” said Fouquet, warmly; “your majesty knows
very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in
your hand, to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle.”

“_Peste!_” cried the king; “I do not wish those fine fortifications,
which cost so much to build, to fall at all. No, let them stand against
the Dutch and English. You would not guess what I want to see at
Belle-Isle, Monsieur Fouquet; it is the pretty peasants and women of
the lands on the sea-shore, who dance so well, and are so seducing
with their scarlet petticoats! I have heard great boast of your pretty
tenants, monsieur le surintendant; well, let me have a sight of them.”

“Whenever your majesty pleases.”

“Have you any means of transport? It shall be to-morrow, if you like.”

The surintendant felt this stroke, which was not adroit, and replied,
“No, sire; I was ignorant of your majesty’s wish; above all, I was
ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle, and I am prepared with
nothing.”

“You have a boat of your own, nevertheless?”

“I have five; but they are all in port, or at Paimboeuf; and to join
them, or bring them hither, would require at least twenty-four hours.
Have I any occasion to send a courier? Must I do so?”

“Wait a little, put an end to the fever,--wait till to-morrow.”

“That is true. Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred
other ideas?” replied Fouquet, now perfectly convinced and very pale.

The king started, and stretched his hand out towards his little bell,
but Fouquet prevented his ringing.

“Sire,” said he, “I have an ague--I am trembling with cold. If I remain
a moment longer, I shall most likely faint. I request your majesty’s
permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes.”

“Indeed, you are in a shiver; it is painful to behold! Come, Monsieur
Fouquet, begone! I will send to inquire after you.”

“Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness. In an hour I shall be
better.”

“I will call some one to reconduct you,” said the king.

“As you please, sire; I would gladly take the arm of any one.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried the king, ringing his little bell.

“Oh, sire,” interrupted Fouquet, laughing in such a manner as made the
prince feel cold, “would you give me the captain of your musketeers to
take me to my lodgings? An equivocal honor that, sire! A simple footman,
I beg.”

“And why, M. Fouquet? M. d’Artagnan conducts me often, and extremely
well!”

“Yes, but when he conducts you, sire, it is to obey you; whilst me--”

“Go on!”

“If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the
musketeers, it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested.”

“Arrested!” replied the king, who became paler than Fouquet
himself,--“arrested! oh!”

“And why should they not say so?” continued Fouquet, still laughing;
“and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to
laugh at it.” This sally disconcerted the monarch. Fouquet was skillful
enough, or fortunate enough, to make Louis XIV. recoil before the
appearance of the deed he meditated. M. d’Artagnan, when he appeared,
received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant.

“Quite unnecessary,” said the latter; “sword for sword; I prefer
Gourville, who is waiting for me below. But that will not prevent me
enjoying the society of M. d’Artagnan. I am glad he will see Belle-Isle,
he is so good a judge of fortifications.”

D’Artagnan bowed, without at all comprehending what was going on.
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment, affecting all the slowness
of a man who walks with difficulty. When once out of the castle, “I am
saved!” said he. “Oh! yes, disloyal king, you shall see Belle-Isle, but
it shall be when I am no longer there.”

He disappeared, leaving D’Artagnan with the king.

“Captain,” said the king, “you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of
a hundred paces.”

“Yes, sire.”

“He is going to his lodgings again. You will go with him.”

“Yes, sire.”

“You will arrest him in my name, and will shut him up in a carriage.”

“In a carriage. Well, sire?”

“In such a fashion that he may not, on the road, either converse with
any one or throw notes to people he may meet.”

“That will be rather difficult, sire.”

“Not at all.”

“Pardon me, sire, I cannot stifle M. Fouquet, and if he asks for liberty
to breathe, I cannot prevent him by closing both the windows and
the blinds. He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes
possible.”

“The case is provided for, Monsieur d’Artagnan; a carriage with a
trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out.”

“A carriage with an iron trellis!” cried D’Artagnan; “but a carriage
with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour, and your majesty
commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet’s lodgings.”

“The carriage in question is already made.”

“Ah! that is quite a different thing,” said the captain; “if the
carriage is ready made, very well, then, we have only to set it in
motion.”

“It is ready--and the horses harnessed.”

“Ah!”

“And the coachman, with the outriders, is waiting in the lower court of
the castle.”

D’Artagnan bowed. “There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither
I shall conduct M. Fouquet.”

“To the castle of Angers, at first.”

“Very well, sire.”

“Afterwards we will see.”

“Yes, sire.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan, one last word: you have remarked that, for making
this capture of M. Fouquet, I have not employed my guards, on which
account M. de Gesvres will be furious.”

“Your majesty does not employ your guards,” said the captain, a little
humiliated, “because you mistrust M. de Gesvres, that is all.”

“That is to say, monsieur, that I have more confidence in you.”

“I know that very well, sire! and it is of no use to make so much of
it.”

“It is only for the sake of arriving at this, monsieur, that if, from
this moment, it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet
should escape--such chances have been, monsieur--”

“Oh! very often, sire; but for others, not for me.”

“And why not with you?”

“Because I, sire, have, for an instant, wished to save M. Fouquet.”

The king started. “Because,” continued the captain, “I had then a right
to do so, having guessed your majesty’s plan, without you having spoken
to me of it, and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet. Now, was I not
at liberty to show my interest in this man?”

“In truth, monsieur, you do not reassure me with regard to your
services.”

“If I had saved him then, I should have been perfectly innocent; I will
say more, I should have done well, for M. Fouquet is not a bad man. But
he was not willing; his destiny prevailed; he let the hour of liberty
slip by. So much the worse! Now I have orders, I will obey those orders,
and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested. He is at the castle
of Angers, this very M. Fouquet.”

“Oh! you have not got him yet, captain.”

“That concerns me; every one to his trade, sire; only, once more,
reflect! Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet, sire?”

“Yes, a thousand times, yes!”

“In writing, sire, then.”

“Here is the order.”

D’Artagnan read it, bowed to the king, and left the room. From the
height of the terrace he perceived Gourville, who went by with a joyous
air towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet.



Chapter XL: The White Horse and the Black.

“That is rather surprising,” said D’Artagnan; “Gourville running about
the streets so gayly, when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in
danger; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who
warned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand
pieces upon the terrace, and given to the winds by monsieur le
surintendant. Gourville is rubbing his hands; that is because he has
done something clever. Whence comes M. Gourville? Gourville is coming
from the Rue aux Herbes. Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead?” And
D’Artagnan followed, along the tops of the houses of Nantes, dominated
by the castle, the line traced by the streets, as he would have done
upon a topographical plan; only, instead of the dead, flat paper, the
living chart rose in relief with the cries, the movements, and the
shadows of men and things. Beyond the inclosure of the city, the great
verdant plains stretched out, bordering the Loire, and appeared to run
towards the pink horizon, which was cut by the azure of the waters and
the dark green of the marshes. Immediately outside the gates of Nantes
two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a gigantic
hand. D’Artagnan, who had taken in all the panorama at a glance by
crossing the terrace, was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes to
the mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of
Nantes. One step more, and he was about to descend the stairs, take
his trellised carriage, and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet. But
chance decreed, at the moment of plunging into the staircase, that he
was attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road.

“What is that?” said the musketeer to himself; “a horse galloping,--a
runaway horse, no doubt. What a rate he is going at!” The moving point
became detached from the road, and entered into the fields. “A white
horse,” continued the captain, who had just observed the color thrown
luminously against the dark ground, “and he is mounted; it must be some
boy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him.”

These reflections, rapid as lightning, simultaneous with visual
perception, D’Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the
first steps of the staircase. Some morsels of paper were spread over the
stairs, and shone out white against the dirty stones. “Eh! eh!” said the
captain to himself, “here are some of the fragments of the note torn by
M. Fouquet. Poor man! he has given his secret to the wind; the wind will
have no more to do with it, and brings it back to the king. Decidedly,
Fouquet, you play with misfortune! the game is not a fair one,--fortune
is against you. The star of Louis XIV. obscures yours; the adder is
stronger and more cunning than the squirrel.” D’Artagnan picked up one
of these morsels of paper as he descended. “Gourville’s pretty little
hand!” cried he, whilst examining one of the fragments of the note; “I
was not mistaken.” And he read the word “horse.” “Stop!” said he; and he
examined another, upon which there was not a letter traced. Upon a third
he read the word “white;” “white horse,” repeated he, like a child that
is spelling. “Ah, _mordioux!_” cried the suspicious spirit, “a white
horse!” And, like that grain of powder which, burning, dilates into
ten thousand times its volume, D’Artagnan, enlightened by ideas and
suspicions, rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace. The
white horse was still galloping in the direction of the Loire, at the
extremity of which, melting into the vapors of the water, a little
sail appeared, wave-balanced like a water-butterfly. “Oh!” cried the
musketeer, “only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across
plowed lands; there is but one Fouquet, a financier, to ride thus in
open day upon a white horse; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle
who would make his escape towards the sea, while there are such thick
forests on land, and there is but one D’Artagnan in the world to catch
M. Fouquet, who has half an hour’s start, and who will have gained his
boat within an hour.” This being said, the musketeer gave orders that
the carriage with the iron trellis should be taken immediately to a
thicket situated just outside the city. He selected his best horse,
jumped upon his back, galloped along the Rue aux Herbes, taking, not the
road Fouquet had taken, but the bank itself of the Loire, certain
that he should gain ten minutes upon the total distance, and, at the
intersection of the two lines, come up with the fugitive, who could have
no suspicion of being pursued in that direction. In the rapidity of the
pursuit, and with the impatience of the avenger, animating himself as in
war, D’Artagnan, so mild, so kind towards Fouquet, was surprised to find
himself become ferocious--almost sanguinary. For a long time he galloped
without catching sight of the white horse. His rage assumed fury, he
doubted himself,--he suspected that Fouquet had buried himself in some
subterranean road, or that he had changed the white horse for one of
those famous black ones, as swift as the wind, which D’Artagnan, at
Saint-Mande, had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and
their fleetness.

At such moments, when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears
spring from them, when the saddle had become burning hot, when the
galled and spurred horse reared with pain, and threw behind him a shower
of dust and stones, D’Artagnan, raising himself in his stirrups, and
seeing nothing on the waters, nothing beneath the trees, looked up into
the air like a madman. He was losing his senses. In the paroxysms of
eagerness he dreamt of aerial ways,--the discovery of the following century;
he called to his mind Daedalus and the vast wings that had saved him
from the prisons of Crete. A hoarse sigh broke from his lips, as he
repeated, devoured by the fear of ridicule, “I! I! duped by a Gourville!
I! They will say that I am growing old,--they will say I have received a
million to allow Fouquet to escape!” And he again dug his spurs into the
sides of his horse: he had ridden astonishingly fast. Suddenly, at the
extremity of some open pasture-ground, behind the hedges, he saw a white
form which showed itself, disappeared, and at last remained distinctly
visible against the rising ground. D’Artagnan’s heart leaped with joy.
He wiped the streaming sweat from his brow, relaxed the tension of his
knees,--by which the horse breathed more freely,--and, gathering up his
reins, moderated the speed of the vigorous animal, his active accomplice
on this man-hunt. He had then time to study the direction of the
road, and his position with regard to Fouquet. The superintendent had
completely winded his horse by crossing the soft ground. He felt the
necessity of gaining a firmer footing, and turned towards the road by
the shortest secant line. D’Artagnan, on his part, had nothing to do but
to ride straight on, concealed by the sloping shore; so that he would
cut his quarry off the road when he came up with him. Then the real race
would begin,--then the struggle would be in earnest.

D’Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time. He observed that the
superintendent had relaxed into a trot, which was to say, he, too, was
favoring his horse. But both of them were too much pressed for time to
allow them to continue long at that pace. The white horse sprang off
like an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground. D’Artagnan
dropped his head, and his black horse broke into a gallop. Both followed
the same route; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were
confounded. Fouquet had not yet perceived D’Artagnan. But on issuing
from the slope, a single echo struck the air; it was that of the steps
of D’Artagnan’s horse, which rolled along like thunder. Fouquet turned
round, and saw behind him, within a hundred paces, his enemy bent over
the neck of his horse. There could be no doubt--the shining baldrick,
the red cassock--it was a musketeer. Fouquet slackened his hand
likewise, and the white horse placed twenty feet more between his
adversary and himself.

“Oh, but,” thought D’Artagnan, becoming very anxious, “that is not
a common horse M. Fouquet is upon--let us see!” And he attentively
examined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the
courser. Round full quarters--a thin long tail--large hocks--thin legs,
as dry as bars of steel--hoofs hard as marble. He spurred his own, but
the distance between the two remained the same. D’Artagnan listened
attentively; not a breath of the horse reached him, and yet he seemed
to cut the air. The black horse, on the contrary, began to puff like any
blacksmith’s bellows.

“I must overtake him, if I kill my horse,” thought the musketeer; and he
began to saw the mouth of the poor animal, whilst he buried the rowels
of his merciless spurs into his sides. The maddened horse gained twenty
toises, and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet.

“Courage!” said the musketeer to himself, “courage! the white horse will
perhaps grow weaker, and if the horse does not fall, the master must
pull up at last.” But horse and rider remained upright together, gaining
ground by difficult degrees. D’Artagnan uttered a wild cry, which made
Fouquet turn round, and added speed to the white horse.

“A famous horse! a mad rider!” growled the captain. “Hola! _mordioux!_
Monsieur Fouquet! stop! in the king’s name!” Fouquet made no reply.

“Do you hear me?” shouted D’Artagnan, whose horse had just stumbled.

“_Pardieu!_” replied Fouquet, laconically; and rode on faster.

D’Artagnan was nearly mad; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and
his eyes. “In the king’s name!” cried he again, “stop, or I will bring
you down with a pistol-shot!”

“Do!” replied Fouquet, without relaxing his speed.

D’Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it, hoping that the double click
of the spring would stop his enemy. “You have pistols likewise,” said
he, “turn and defend yourself.”

Fouquet did turn round at the noise, and looking D’Artagnan full in the
face, opened, with his right hand, the part of his dress which concealed
his body, but he did not even touch his holsters. There were not more
than twenty paces between the two.

“_Mordioux!_” said D’Artagnan, “I will not assassinate you; if you will
not fire upon me, surrender! what is a prison?”

“I would rather die!” replied Fouquet; “I shall suffer less.”

D’Artagnan, drunk with despair, hurled his pistol to the ground. “I
will take you alive!” said he; and by a prodigy of skill which this
incomparable horseman alone was capable, he threw his horse forward to
within ten paces of the white horse; already his hand was stretched out
to seize his prey.

“Kill me! kill me!” cried Fouquet, “‘twould be more humane!”

“No! alive--alive!” murmured the captain.

At this moment his horse made a false step for the second time, and
Fouquet’s again took the lead. It was an unheard-of spectacle, this
race between two horses which now only kept alive by the will of their
riders. It might be said that D’Artagnan rode, carrying his horse along
between his knees. To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast trot,
and that had sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all.
But the chase appeared equally warm in the two fatigued _athletoe_.
D’Artagnan, quite in despair, seized his second pistol, and cocked it.

“At your horse! not at you!” cried he to Fouquet. And he fired. The
animal was hit in the quarters--he made a furious bound, and plunged
forward. At that moment D’Artagnan’s horse fell dead.

“I am dishonored!” thought the musketeer; “I am a miserable wretch! for
pity’s sake, M. Fouquet, throw me one of your pistols, that I may blow
out my brains!” But Fouquet rode away.

“For mercy’s sake! for mercy’s sake!” cried D’Artagnan; “that which you
will not do at this moment, I myself will do within an hour, but here,
upon this road, I should die bravely; I should die esteemed; do me that
service, M. Fouquet!”

M. Fouquet made no reply, but continued to trot on. D’Artagnan began to
run after his enemy. Successively he threw away his hat, his coat, which
embarrassed him, and then the sheath of his sword, which got between his
legs as he was running. The sword in his hand itself became too heavy,
and he threw it after the sheath. The white horse began to rattle in
its throat; D’Artagnan gained upon him. From a trot the exhausted animal
sunk to a staggering walk--the foam from his mouth was mixed with blood.
D’Artagnan made a desperate effort, sprang towards Fouquet, and seized
him by the leg, saying in a broken, breathless voice, “I arrest you in
the king’s name! blow my brains out, if you like; we have both done our
duty.”

Fouquet hurled far from him, into the river, the two pistols D’Artagnan
might have seized, and dismounting from his horse--“I am your prisoner,
monsieur,” said he; “will you take my arm, for I see you are ready to
faint?”

“Thanks!” murmured D’Artagnan, who, in fact, felt the earth sliding from
under his feet, and the light of day turning to blackness around him;
then he rolled upon the sand, without breath or strength. Fouquet
hastened to the brink of the river, dipped some water in his hat, with
which he bathed the temples of the musketeer, and introduced a few drop
between his lips. D’Artagnan raised himself with difficulty, and looked
about him with a wandering eye. He beheld Fouquet on his knees, with his
wet hat in his hand, smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness. “You are
not off, then?” cried he. “Oh, monsieur! the true king of royalty,
in heart, in soul, is not Louis of the Louvre, or Philippe of
Sainte-Marguerite; it is you, proscribed, condemned!”

“I, who this day am ruined by a single error, M. d’Artagnan.”

“What, in the name of Heaven, is that?”

“I should have had you for a friend! But how shall we return to Nantes?
We are a great way from it.”

“That is true,” said D’Artagnan, gloomily.

“The white horse will recover, perhaps; he is a good horse! Mount,
Monsieur d’Artagnan; I will walk till you have rested a little.”

“Poor beast! and wounded, too?” said the musketeer.

“He will go, I tell you; I know him; but we can do better still, let us
both get up, and ride slowly.”

“We can try,” said the captain. But they had scarcely charged the animal
with this double load, when he began to stagger, and then with a great
effort walked a few minutes, then staggered again, and sank down dead by
the side of the black horse, which he had just managed to come up to.

“We will go on foot--destiny wills it so--the walk will be pleasant,”
 said Fouquet, passing his arm through that of D’Artagnan.

“_Mordioux!_” cried the latter, with a fixed eye, a contracted brow, and
a swelling heart--“What a disgraceful day!”

They walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little
wood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting. When Fouquet
perceived that sinister machine, he said to D’Artagnan, who cast down
his eyes, ashamed of Louis XIV., “There is an idea that did not emanate
from a brave man, Captain d’Artagnan; it is not yours. What are these
gratings for?” said he.

“To prevent your throwing letters out.”

“Ingenious!”

“But you can speak, if you cannot write,” said D’Artagnan.

“Can I speak to you?”

“Why, certainly, if you wish to do so.”

Fouquet reflected for a moment, then looking the captain full in the
face, “One single word,” said he; “will you remember it?”

“I will not forget it.”

“Will you speak it to whom I wish?”

“I will.”

“Saint-Mande,” articulated Fouquet, in a low voice.

“Well! and for whom?”

“For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson.”

“It shall be done.”

The carriage rolled through Nantes, and took the route to Angers.



Chapter XLI. In Which the Squirrel Falls,--the Adder Flies.

It was two o’clock in the afternoon. The king, full of impatience,
went to his cabinet on the terrace, and kept opening the door of the
corridor, to see what his secretaries were doing. M. Colbert, seated in
the same place M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning,
was chatting in a low voice with M. de Brienne. The king opened the door
suddenly, and addressed them. “What is it you are saying?”

“We were speaking of the first sitting of the States,” said M. de
Brienne, rising.

“Very well,” replied the king, and returned to his room.

Five minutes after, the summons of the bell recalled Rose, whose hour it
was.

“Have you finished your copies?” asked the king.

“Not yet, sire.”

“See if M. d’Artagnan has returned.”

“Not yet, sire.”

“It is very strange,” murmured the king. “Call M. Colbert.”

Colbert entered; he had been expecting this all the morning.

“Monsieur Colbert,” said the king, very sharply; “you must ascertain
what has become of M. d’Artagnan.”

Colbert in his calm voice replied, “Where does your majesty desire him
to be sought for?”

“Eh! monsieur! do you not know on what I have sent him?” replied Louis,
acrimoniously.

“Your majesty did not inform me.”

“Monsieur, there are things that must be guessed; and you, above all,
are apt to guess them.”

“I might have been able to imagine, sire; but I do not presume to be
positive.”

Colbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of
the king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the
monarch and his clerk.

“D’Artagnan!” cried the king, with evident joy.

D’Artagnan, pale and in evidently bad humor, cried to the king, as
he entered, “Sire, is it your majesty who has given orders to my
musketeers?”

“What orders?” said the king.

“About M. Fouquet’s house?”

“None!” replied Louis.

“Ha!” said D’Artagnan, biting his mustache; “I was not mistaken, then;
it was monsieur here;” and he pointed to Colbert.

“What orders? Let me know,” said the king.

“Orders to turn the house topsy-turvy, to beat M. Fouquet’s servants, to
force the drawers, to give over a peaceful house to pillage! _Mordioux!_
these are savage orders!”

“Monsieur!” said Colbert, turning pale.

“Monsieur,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “the king alone, understand,--the
king alone has a right to command my musketeers; but, as to you, I
forbid you to do it, and I tell you so before his majesty; gentlemen who
carry swords do not sling pens behind their ears.”

“D’Artagnan! D’Artagnan!” murmured the king.

“It is humiliating,” continued the musketeer; “my soldiers are
disgraced. I do not command _reitres_, thank you, nor clerks of the
intendant, _mordioux!_”

“Well! but what is all this about?” said the king with authority.

“About this, sire; monsieur--monsieur, who could not guess your
majesty’s orders, and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest
M. Fouquet; monsieur, who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for
his patron of yesterday--has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings
of M. Fouquet, and, under the pretense of securing the surintendant’s
papers, they have taken away the furniture. My musketeers have been
posted round the house all the morning; such were my orders. Why did any
one presume to order them to enter? Why, by forcing them to assist in
this pillage, have they been made accomplices in it? _Mordioux!_ we
serve the king, we do; but we do not serve M. Colbert!” [5]

“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the king, sternly, “take care; it is not in
my presence that such explanations, and made in such a tone, should take
place.”

“I have acted for the good of the king,” said Colbert, in a faltering
voice. “It is hard to be so treated by one of your majesty’s officers,
and that without redress, on account of the respect I owe the king.”

“The respect you owe the king,” cried D’Artagnan, his eyes flashing
fire, “consists, in the first place, in making his authority respected,
and his person beloved. Every agent of a power without control
represents that power, and when people curse the hand which strikes
them, it is the royal hand that God reproaches, do you hear? Must a
soldier, hardened by forty years of wounds and blood, give you this
lesson, monsieur? Must mercy be on my side, and ferocity on yours? You
have caused the innocent to be arrested, bound, and imprisoned!”

“Accomplices, perhaps, of M. Fouquet,” said Colbert.

“Who told you M. Fouquet had accomplices, or even that he was guilty?
The king alone knows that; his justice is not blind! When he says,
‘Arrest and imprison’ such and such a man, he is obeyed. Do not talk to
me, then, any more of the respect you owe the king, and be careful of
your words, that they may not chance to convey the slightest menace;
for the king will not allow those to be threatened who do him service
by others who do him disservice; and if in case I should have, which God
forbid! a master so ungrateful, I would make myself respected.”

Thus saying, D’Artagnan took his station haughtily in the king’s
cabinet, his eyes flashing, his hand on his sword, his lips trembling,
affecting much more anger than he really felt. Colbert, humiliated and
devoured with rage, bowed to the king as if to ask his permission to
leave the room. The king, thwarted alike in pride and in curiosity, knew
not which part to take. D’Artagnan saw him hesitate. To remain longer
would have been a mistake: it was necessary to score a triumph over
Colbert, and the only method was to touch the king so near the quick,
that his majesty would have no other means of extrication but choosing
between the two antagonists. D’Artagnan bowed as Colbert had done; but
the king, who, in preference to everything else, was anxious to have all
the exact details of the arrest of the surintendant of the finances from
him who had made him tremble for a moment,--the king, perceiving that
the ill-humor of D’Artagnan would put off for half an hour at least the
details he was burning to be acquainted with,--Louis, we say, forgot
Colbert, who had nothing new to tell him, and recalled his captain of
the musketeers.

“In the first place,” said he, “let me see the result of your
commission, monsieur; you may rest yourself hereafter.”

D’Artagnan, who was just passing through the doorway, stopped at the
voice of the king, retraced his steps, and Colbert was forced to leave
the closet. His countenance assumed almost a purple hue, his black and
threatening eyes shone with a dark fire beneath their thick brows; he
stepped out, bowed before the king, half drew himself up in passing
D’Artagnan, and went away with death in his heart. D’Artagnan, on
being left alone with the king, softened immediately, and composing his
countenance: “Sire,” said he, “you are a young king. It is by the dawn
that people judge whether the day will be fine or dull. How, sire, will
the people, whom the hand of God has placed under your law, argue
of your reign, if between them and you, you allow angry and violent
ministers to interpose their mischief? But let us speak of myself, sire,
let us leave a discussion that may appear idle, and perhaps inconvenient
to you. Let us speak of myself. I have arrested M. Fouquet.”

“You took plenty of time about it,” said the king, sharply.

D’Artagnan looked at the king. “I perceive that I have expressed
myself badly. I announced to your majesty that I had arrested Monsieur
Fouquet.”

“You did; and what then?”

“Well! I ought to have told your majesty that M. Fouquet had arrested
me; that would have been more just. I re-establish the truth, then; I
have been arrested by M. Fouquet.”

It was now the turn of Louis XIV. to be surprised. His majesty was
astonished in his turn.

D’Artagnan, with his quick glance, appreciated what was passing in the
heart of his master. He did not allow him time to put any questions. He
related, with that poetry, that picturesqueness, which perhaps he
alone possessed at that period, the escape of Fouquet, the pursuit,
the furious race, and, lastly, the inimitable generosity of the
surintendant, who might have fled ten times over, who might have killed
the adversary in the pursuit, but who had preferred imprisonment,
perhaps worse, to the humiliation of one who wished to rob him of his
liberty. In proportion as the tale advanced, the king became agitated,
devouring the narrator’s words, and drumming with his finger-nails upon
the table.

“It results from all this, sire, in my eyes, at least, that the man who
conducts himself thus is a gallant man, and cannot be an enemy to the
king. That is my opinion, and I repeat it to your majesty. I know what
the king will say to me, and I bow to it,--reasons of state. So be it!
To my ears that sounds highly respectable. But I am a soldier, and I
have received my orders, my orders are executed--very unwillingly on my
part, it is true, but they are executed. I say no more.”

“Where is M. Fouquet at this moment?” asked Louis, after a short
silence.

“M. Fouquet, sire,” replied D’Artagnan, “is in the iron cage that M.
Colbert had prepared for him, and is galloping as fast as four strong
horses can drag him, towards Angers.”

“Why did you leave him on the road?”

“Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers. The proof, the
best proof of what I advance, is that the king desired me to be sought
for but this minute. And then I had another reason.”

“What is that?”

“Whilst I was with him, poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape.”

“Well!” cried the king, astonished.

“Your majesty ought to understand, and does understand, certainly, that
my warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty. I have
given him one of my brigadiers, the most stupid I could find among my
musketeers, in order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping.”

“Are you mad, Monsieur d’Artagnan?” cried the king, crossing his arms
on his breast. “Do people utter such enormities, even when they have the
misfortune to think them?”

“Ah! sire, you cannot expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet,
after what he has just done for you and me. No, no; if you desire that
he should remain under your lock and bolt, never give him in charge to
me; however closely wired might be the cage, the bird would, in the end,
take wing.”

“I am surprised,” said the king, in his sternest tone, “you did not
follow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my
throne. You had in him all you want--affection, gratitude. In my
service, monsieur, you will only find a master.”

“If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile, sire,” replied
D’Artagnan, with a deeply impressive manner, “one single man would have
gone there, and I should have been that man--you know that right well,
sire.”

The king was brought to a pause. Before that speech of his captain of
the musketeers, so frankly spoken and so true, the king had nothing to
offer. On hearing D’Artagnan, Louis remembered the D’Artagnan of former
times; him who, at the Palais Royal, held himself concealed behind the
curtains of his bed, when the people of Paris, led by Cardinal de Retz,
came to assure themselves of the presence of the king; the D’Artagnan
whom he saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage, when
repairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris; the soldier who had
quitted his service at Blois; the lieutenant he had recalled to be
beside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power; the man
he had always found loyal, courageous, devoted. Louis advanced towards
the door and called Colbert. Colbert had not left the corridor where the
secretaries were at work. He reappeared.

“Colbert, did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet?”

“Yes, sire.”

“What has it produced?”

“M. de Roncherolles, who was sent with your majesty’s musketeers, has
remitted me some papers,” replied Colbert.

“I will look at them. Give me your hand.”

“My hand, sire!”

“Yes, that I may place it in that of M. d’Artagnan. In fact, M.
d’Artagnan,” added he, with a smile, turning towards the soldier, who,
at sight of the clerk, had resumed his haughty attitude, “you do not
know this man; make his acquaintance.” And he pointed to Colbert. “He
has been made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions,
but he will be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank.”

“Sire!” stammered Colbert, confused with pleasure and fear.

“I always understood why,” murmured D’Artagnan in the king’s ear; “he
was jealous.”

“Precisely, and his jealousy confined his wings.”

“He will henceforward be a winged-serpent,” grumbled the musketeer, with
a remnant of hatred against his recent adversary.

But Colbert, approaching him, offered to his eyes a physiognomy so
different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear; he
appeared so good, so mild, so easy; his eyes took the expression of an
intelligence so noble, that D’Artagnan, a connoisseur in physiognomies,
was moved, and almost changed in his convictions. Colbert pressed his
hand.

“That which the king has just told you, monsieur, proves how well
his majesty is acquainted with men. The inveterate opposition I have
displayed, up to this day, against abuses and not against men, proves
that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign, for my
country a great blessing. I have many ideas, M. d’Artagnan. You will
see them expand in the sun of public peace; and if I have not the good
fortune to conquer the friendship of honest men, I am at least certain,
monsieur, that I shall obtain their esteem. For their admiration,
monsieur, I would give my life.”

This change, this sudden elevation, this mute approbation of the king,
gave the musketeer matter for profound reflection. He bowed civilly to
Colbert, who did not take his eyes off him. The king, when he saw they
were reconciled, dismissed them. They left the room together. As soon
as they were out of the cabinet, the new minister, stopping the captain,
said:

“Is it possible, M. d’Artagnan, that with such an eye as yours, you did
not, at the first glance, at the first impression, discover what sort of
man I am?”

“Monsieur Colbert,” replied the musketeer, “a ray of the sun in our eyes
prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame. The man in power radiates,
you know; and since you are there, why should you continue to persecute
him who had just fallen into disgrace, and fallen from such a height?”

“I, monsieur!” said Colbert; “oh, monsieur! I would never persecute
him. I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone,
because I am ambitious, and, above all, because I have the most entire
confidence in my own merit; because I know that all the gold of this
country will ebb and flow beneath my eyes, and I love to look at the
king’s gold; because, if I live thirty years, in thirty years not a
_denir_ of it will remain in my hands; because, with that gold, I will
build granaries, castles, cities, and harbors; because I will create a
marine, I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the
most distant people; because I will create libraries and academies;
because I will make France the first country in the world, and the
wealthiest. These are the motives for my animosity against M. Fouquet,
who prevented my acting. And then, when I shall be great and strong,
when France is great and strong, in my turn, then, will I cry, ‘Mercy’!”

“Mercy, did you say? then ask his liberty of the king. The king is only
crushing him on _your_ account.”

Colbert again raised his head. “Monsieur,” said he, “you know that is
not so, and that the king has his own personal animosity against M.
Fouquet; it is not for me to teach you that.”

“But the king will grow tired; he will forget.”

“The king never forgets, M. d’Artagnan. Hark! the king calls. He is
going to issue an order. I have not influenced him, have I? Listen.”

The king, in fact, was calling his secretaries. “Monsieur d’Artagnan,”
 said he.

“I am here, sire.”

“Give twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan, to form a guard
for M. Fouquet.”

D’Artagnan and Colbert exchanged looks. “And from Angers,” continued the
king, “they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile, in Paris.”

“You were right,” said the captain to the minister.

“Saint-Aignan,” continued the king, “you will have any one shot who
shall attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet, during the journey.”

“But myself, sire,” said the duke.

“You, monsieur, you will only speak to him in the presence of the
musketeers.” The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission.

D’Artagnan was about to retire likewise; but the king stopped him.

“Monsieur,” said he, “you will go immediately, and take possession of
the isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer.”

“Yes, sire. Alone?”

“You will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay, in case
the place should be contumacious.”

A murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers. “That
shall be done,” said D’Artagnan.

“I saw the place in my infancy,” resumed the king, “and I do not wish to
see it again. You have heard me? Go, monsieur, and do not return without
the keys.”

Colbert went up to D’Artagnan. “A commission which, if you carry it out
well,” said he, “will be worth a marechal’s baton to you.”

“Why do you employ the words, ‘if you carry it out well’?”

“Because it is difficult.”

“Ah! in what respect?”

“You have friends in Belle-Isle, Monsieur d’Artagnan; and it is not an
easy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to
obtain success.”

D’Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought, whilst Colbert returned to
the king. A quarter of an hour after, the captain received the written
order from the king, to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle, in case of
resistance, with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or
refugees, and an injunction not to allow one to escape.

“Colbert was right,” thought D’Artagnan; “for me the baton of a marechal
of France will cost the lives of my two friends. Only they seem to
forget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds, and that they
will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings.
I will show them that hand so plainly, that they will have quite time
enough to see it. Poor Porthos! Poor Aramis! No; my fortune should shall
not cost your wings a feather.”

Having thus determined, D’Artagnan assembled the royal army, embarked it
at Paimboeuf, and set sail, without the loss of an unnecessary minute.



Chapter XLII. Belle-Ile-en-Mer.

At the extremity of the mole, against which the furious sea beats at the
evening tide, two men, holding each other by the arm, were conversing
in an animated and expansive tone, without the possibility of any other
human being hearing their words, borne away, as they were, one by one,
by the gusts of wind, with the white foam swept from the crests of the
waves. The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned
ocean, like a gigantic crucible. From time to time, one of these men,
turning towards the east, cast an anxious, inquiring look over the sea.
The other, interrogating the features of his companion, seemed to seek
for information in his looks. Then, both silent, busied with dismal
thoughts, they resumed their walk. Every one has already perceived that
these two men were our proscribed heroes, Porthos and Aramis, who had
taken refuge in Belle-Isle, since the ruin of their hopes, since the
discomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d’Herblay.

“If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary, my dear Aramis,”
 repeated Porthos, inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he
charged his massive chest, “It is of no use, Aramis. The disappearance
of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary
circumstance. There has been no storm at sea; the weather has been
constantly calm, not even the lightest gale; and even if we had had
a tempest, all our boats would not have foundered. I repeat, it is
strange. This complete disappearance astonishes me, I tell you.”

“True,” murmured Aramis. “You are right, friend Porthos; it is true,
there is something strange in it.”

“And further,” added Porthos, whose ideas the assent of the bishop of
Vannes seemed to enlarge; “and, further, do you not observe that if the
boats have perished, not a single plank has washed ashore?”

“I have remarked it as well as yourself.”

“And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in
the whole island, and which I sent in search of the others--”

Aramis here interrupted his companion by a cry, and by so sudden a
movement, that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied. “What do you
say, Porthos? What!--You have sent the two boats--”

“In search of the others! Yes, to be sure I have,” replied Porthos,
calmly.

“Unhappy man! What have you done? Then we are indeed lost,” cried the
bishop.

“Lost!--what did you say?” exclaimed the terrified Porthos. “How lost,
Aramis? How are we lost?”

Aramis bit his lips. “Nothing! nothing! Your pardon, I meant to say--”

“What?”

“That if we were inclined--if we took a fancy to make an excursion by
sea, we could not.”

“Very good! and why should that vex you? A precious pleasure, _ma foi!_
For my part, I don’t regret it at all. What I regret is certainly not
the more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle: what I regret,
Aramis, is Pierrefonds; Bracieux; le Vallon; beautiful France! Here, we
are not in France, my dear friend; we are--I know not where. Oh! I
tell you, in full sincerity of soul, and your affection will excuse my
frankness, but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle. No; in
good truth, I am not happy!”

Aramis breathed a long, but stifled sigh. “Dear friend,” replied he:
“that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had
left in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago. If you had
not sent them away, we would have departed.”

“‘Departed!’ And the orders, Aramis?”

“What orders?”

“_Parbleu!_ Why, the orders you have been constantly, in and out of
season, repeating to me--that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the
usurper. You know very well!”

“That is true!” murmured Aramis again.

“You see, then, plainly, my friend, that we could not depart; and that
the sending away of the boats in search of the others cannot prove
prejudicial to us in the very least.”

Aramis was silent; and his vague glances, luminous as that of an
albatross, hovered for a long time over the sea, interrogating space,
seeking to pierce the very horizon.

“With all that, Aramis,” continued Porthos, who adhered to his idea,
and that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed
it,--“with all that, you give me no explanation about what can have
happened to these unfortunate boats. I am assailed by cries and
complaints whichever way I go. The children cry to see the desolation of
the women, as if I could restore the absent husbands and fathers. What
do you suppose, my friend, and how ought I to answer them?”

“Think all you like, my good Porthos, and say nothing.”

This reply did not satisfy Porthos at all. He turned away grumbling
something in ill-humor. Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer. “Do you
remember,” said he, in a melancholy tone, kneading the two hands of the
giant between his own with affectionate cordiality, “do you remember,
my friend, that in the glorious days of youth--do you remember, Porthos,
when we were all strong and valiant--we, and the other two--if we had
then had an inclination to return to France, do you think this sheet of
salt water would have stopped us?”

“Oh!” said Porthos; “but six leagues.”

“If you had seen me get astride of a plank, would you have remained on
land, Porthos?”

“No, _pardieu!_ No, Aramis. But, nowadays, what sort of a plank should
we want, my friend! I, in particular.” And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast
a profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh. “And do
you mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little,
and that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling--of your
episcopal palace, at Vannes? Come, confess.”

“No,” replied Aramis, without daring to look at Porthos.

“Let us stay where we are, then,” said his friend, with a sigh, which,
in spite of the efforts he made to restrain it, escaped his echoing
breast. “Let us remain!--let us remain! And yet,” added he, “and yet,
if we seriously wished, but that decidedly--if we had a fixed idea, one
firmly taken, to return to France, and there were not boats--”

“Have you remarked another thing, my friend--that is, since the
disappearance of our barks, during the last two days’ absence of
fishermen, not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the
isle?”

“Yes, certainly! you are right. I, too, have remarked it, and the
observation was the more naturally made, for, before the last two fatal
days, barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps.”

“I must inquire,” said Aramis, suddenly, and with great agitation. “And
then, if we had a raft constructed--”

“But there are some canoes, my friend; shall I board one?”

“A canoe!--a canoe! Can you think of such a thing, Porthos? A canoe to
be upset in. No, no,” said the bishop of Vannes; “it is not our trade to
ride upon the waves. We will wait, we will wait.”

And Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation. Porthos,
who grew tired of following all the feverish movements of his
friend--Porthos, who in his faith and calmness understood nothing of
the sort of exasperation which was betrayed by his companion’s continual
convulsive starts--Porthos stopped him. “Let us sit down upon this
rock,” said he. “Place yourself there, close to me, Aramis, and I
conjure you, for the last time, to explain to me in a manner I can
comprehend--explain to me what we are doing here.”

“Porthos,” said Aramis, much embarrassed.

“I know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king. That is a
fact, that I understand. Well--”

“Yes?” said Aramis.

“I know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to
the English. I understand that, too.”

“Yes?”

“I know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into
Belle-Isle to take direction of the works, and the command of ten
companies levied and paid by M. Fouquet, or rather the ten companies of
his son-in-law. All that is plain.”

Aramis rose in a state of great impatience. He might be said to be a
lion importuned by a gnat. Porthos held him by the arm. “But what I
cannot understand, what, in spite of all the efforts of my mind, and
all my reflections, I cannot comprehend, and never shall comprehend, is,
that instead of sending us troops, instead of sending us reinforcements
of men, munitions, provisions, they leave us without boats, they
leave Belle-Isle without arrivals, without help; it is that instead of
establishing with us a correspondence, whether by signals, or written
or verbal communications, all relations with the shore are intercepted.
Tell me, Aramis, answer me, or rather, before answering me, will you
allow me to tell you what I have thought? Will you hear what my idea is,
the plan I have conceived?”

The bishop raised his head. “Well! Aramis,” continued Porthos, “I have
dreamed, I have imagined that an event has taken place in France. I
dreamt of M. Fouquet all the night, of lifeless fish, of broken eggs,
of chambers badly furnished, meanly kept. Villainous dreams, my dear
D’Herblay; very unlucky, such dreams!”

“Porthos, what is that yonder?” interrupted Aramis, rising suddenly, and
pointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the
water.

“A bark!” said Porthos; “yes, it is a bark! Ah! we shall have some news
at last.”

“There are two!” cried the bishop, on discovering another mast; “two!
three! four!”

“Five!” said Porthos, in his turn. “Six! seven! Ah! _mon Dieu! mon
Dieu!_ it is a fleet!”

“Our boats returning, probably,” said Aramis, very uneasily, in spite of
the assurance he affected.

“They are very large for fishing-boats,” observed Porthos, “and do you
not remark, my friend, that they come from the Loire?”

“They come from the Loire--yes--”

“And look! everybody here sees them as well as ourselves; look, women
and children are beginning to crowd the jetty.”

An old fisherman passed. “Are those our barks, yonder?” asked Aramis.

The old man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon.

“No, monseigneur,” replied he, “they are lighter boars, boats in the
king’s service.”

“Boats in the royal service?” replied Aramis, starting. “How do you know
that?” said he.

“By the flag.”

“But,” said Porthos, “the boat is scarcely visible; how the devil, my
friend, can you distinguish the flag?”

“I see there is one,” replied the old man; “our boats, trade lighters,
do not carry any. That sort of craft is generally used for transport of
troops.”

“Ah!” groaned Aramis.

“_Vivat!_” cried Porthos, “they are sending us reinforcements, don’t you
think they are, Aramis?”

“Probably.”

“Unless it is the English coming.”

“By the Loire? That would have an evil look, Porthos; for they must have
come through Paris!”

“You are right; they are reinforcements, decidedly, or provisions.”

Aramis leaned his head upon his hands, and made no reply. Then, all at
once,--“Porthos,” said he, “have the alarm sounded.”

“The alarm! do you imagine such a thing?”

“Yes, and let the cannoniers mount their batteries, the artillerymen be
at their pieces, and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries.”

Porthos opened his eyes to their widest extent. He looked attentively at
his friend, to convince himself he was in his proper senses.

“_I_ will do it, my dear Porthos,” continued Aramis, in his blandest
tone; “I will go and have these orders executed myself, if you do not
go, my friend.”

“Well! I will--instantly!” said Porthos, who went to execute the orders,
casting all the while looks behind him, to see if the bishop of Vannes
were not deceived; and if, on recovering more rational ideas, he would
not recall him. The alarm was sounded, trumpets brayed, drums rolled;
the great bronze bell swung in horror from its lofty belfry. The dikes
and moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers; matches
sparkled in the hands of the artillerymen, placed behind the large
cannon bedded in their stone carriages. When every man was at his post,
when all the preparations for defense were made: “Permit me, Aramis, to
try to comprehend,” whispered Porthos, timidly, in Aramis’s ear.

“My dear friend, you will comprehend but too soon,” murmured M.
d’Herblay, in reply to this question of his lieutenant.

“The fleet which is coming yonder, with sails unfurled, straight towards
the port of Belle-Isle, is a royal fleet, is it not?”

“But as there are two kings in France, Porthos, to which of these two
kings does this fleet belong?”

“Oh! you open my eyes,” replied the giant, stunned by the insinuation.

And Porthos, whose eyes this reply of his friend’s had at last opened,
or rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight, went with his
best speed to the batteries to overlook his people, and exhort every
one to do his duty. In the meantime, Aramis, with his eye fixed on the
horizon, saw the ships continually drawing nearer. The people and the
soldiers, perched on the summits of the rocks, could distinguish the
masts, then the lower sails, and at last the hulls of the lighters,
bearing at the masthead the royal flag of France. It was night when
one of these vessels, which had created such a sensation among the
inhabitants of Belle-Isle, dropped anchor within cannon shot of the
place. It was soon seen, notwithstanding the darkness, that some sort
of agitation reigned on board the vessel, from the side of which a skiff
was lowered, of which the three rowers, bending to their oars, took the
direction of the port, and in a few instants struck land at the foot
of the fort. The commander jumped ashore. He had a letter in his hand,
which he waved in the air, and seemed to wish to communicate with
somebody. This man was soon recognized by several soldiers as one of
the pilots of the island. He was the captain of one of the two barks
retained by Aramis, but which Porthos, in his anxiety with regard to
the fate of the fishermen who had disappeared, had sent in search of the
missing boats. He asked to be conducted to M. d’Herblay. Two soldiers,
at a signal from a sergeant, marched him between them, and escorted him.
Aramis was upon the quay. The envoy presented himself before the
bishop of Vannes. The darkness was almost absolute, notwithstanding the
flambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following
Aramis in his rounds.

“Well, Jonathan, from whom do you come?”

“Monseigneur, from those who captured me.”

“Who captured you?”

“You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?”

“Yes; and afterwards?”

“Well! monseigneur, within a short league we were captured by a _chasse
maree_ belonging to the king.”

“Ah!” said Aramis.

“Of which king?” cried Porthos.

Jonathan started.

“Speak!” continued the bishop.

“We were captured, monseigneur, and joined to those who had been taken
yesterday morning.”

“What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all?” said Porthos.

“Monsieur, to prevent us from telling you,” replied Jonathan.

Porthos was again at a loss to comprehend. “And they have released you
to-day?” asked he.

“That I might tell you they have captured us, monsieur.”

“Trouble upon trouble,” thought honest Porthos.

During this time Aramis was reflecting.

“Humph!” said he, “then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the
coasts?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“Who commands it?”

“The captain of the king’s musketeers.”

“D’Artagnan?”

“D’Artagnan!” exclaimed Porthos.

“I believe that is the name.”

“And did he give you this letter?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“Bring the torches nearer.”

“It is his writing,” said Porthos.

Aramis eagerly read the following lines:

“Order of the king to take Belle-Isle; or to put the garrison to the
sword, if they resist; order to make prisoners of all the men of the
garrison; signed, D’ARTAGNAN, who, the day before yesterday, arrested M.
Fouquet, for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile.”

Aramis turned pale, and crushed the paper in his hands.

“What is it?” asked Porthos.

“Nothing, my friend, nothing.”

“Tell me, Jonathan?”

“Monseigneur?”

“Did you speak to M. d’Artagnan?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“What did he say to you?”

“That for ampler information, he would speak with monseigneur.”

“Where?”

“On board his own vessel.”

“On board his vessel!” and Porthos repeated, “On board his vessel!”

“M. le mousquetaire,” continued Jonathan, “told me to take you both on
board my canoe, and bring you to him.”

“Let us go at once,” exclaimed Porthos. “Dear D’Artagnan!”

But Aramis stopped him. “Are you mad?” cried he. “Who knows that it is
not a snare?”

“Of the other king’s?” said Porthos, mysteriously.

“A snare, in fact! That’s what it is, my friend.”

“Very possibly; what is to be done, then? If D’Artagnan sends for us--”

“Who assures you that D’Artagnan sends for us?”

“Well, but--but his writing--”

“Writing is easily counterfeited. This looks counterfeited--unsteady--”

“You are always right; but, in the meantime, we know nothing.”

Aramis was silent.

“It is true,” said the good Porthos, “we do not want to know anything.”

“What shall I do?” asked Jonathan.

“You will return on board this captain’s vessel.”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island.”

“Ah! I comprehend!” said Porthos.

“Yes, monseigneur,” replied Jonathan; “but if the captain should refuse
to come to Belle-Isle?”

“If he refuses, as we have cannon, we will make use of them.”

“What! against D’Artagnan?”

“If it is D’Artagnan, Porthos, he will come. Go, Jonathan, go!”

“_Ma foi!_ I no longer comprehend anything,” murmured Porthos.

“I will make you comprehend it all, my dear friend; the time for it has
come; sit down upon this gun-carriage, open your ears, and listen well
to me.”

“Oh! _pardieu!_ I will listen, no fear of that.”

“May I depart, monseigneur?” cried Jonathan.

“Yes, begone, and bring back an answer. Allow the canoe to pass, you men
there!” And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet.

Aramis took Porthos by the hand, and commenced his explanations.



Chapter XLIII. Explanations by Aramis.

“What I have to say to you, friend Porthos, will probably surprise you,
but it may prove instructive.”

“I like to be surprised,” said Porthos, in a kindly tone; “do not spare
me, therefore, I beg. I am hardened against emotions; don’t fear, speak
out.”

“It is difficult, Porthos--difficult; for, in truth, I warn you a second
time, I have very strange things, very extraordinary things, to tell
you.”

“Oh! you speak so well, my friend, that I could listen to you for days
together. Speak, then, I beg--and--stop, I have an idea: I will, to make
your task more easy, I will, to assist you in telling me such things,
question you.”

“I shall be pleased at your doing so.”

“What are we going to fight for, Aramis?”

“If you ask me many such questions as that--if you would render my task
the easier by interrupting my revelations thus, Porthos, you will not
help me at all. So far, on the contrary, that is the very Gordian knot.
But, my friend, with a man like you, good, generous, and devoted, the
confession must be bravely made. I have deceived you, my worthy friend.”

“You have deceived me!”

“Good Heavens! yes.”

“Was it for my good, Aramis?”

“I thought so, Porthos; I thought so sincerely, my friend.”

“Then,” said the honest seigneur of Bracieux, “you have rendered me a
service, and I thank you for it; for if you had not deceived me, I might
have deceived myself. In what, then, have you deceived me, tell me?”

“In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV., at this
moment, is directing his efforts.”

“The usurper!” said Porthos, scratching his head. “That is--well, I do
not quite clearly comprehend!”

“He is one of the two kings who are contending for the crown of France.”

“Very well! Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV.?”

“You have hit the matter in one word.”

“It follows that--”

“It follows that we are rebels, my poor friend.”

“The devil! the devil!” cried Porthos, much disappointed.

“Oh! but, dear Porthos, be calm, we shall still find means of getting
out of the affair, trust me.”

“It is not that which makes me uneasy,” replied Porthos; “that which
alone touches me is that ugly word _rebels_.”

“Ah! but--”

“And so, according to this, the duchy that was promised me--”

“It was the usurper that was to give it to you.”

“And that is not the same thing, Aramis,” said Porthos, majestically.

“My friend, if it had only depended upon me, you should have become a
prince.”

Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way.

“That is where you have been wrong,” continued he, “in deceiving me; for
that promised duchy I reckoned upon. Oh! I reckoned upon it seriously,
knowing you to be a man of your word, Aramis.”

“Poor Porthos! pardon me, I implore you!”

“So, then,” continued Porthos, without replying to the bishop’s prayer,
“so then, it seems, I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV.?”

“Oh! I will settle all that, my good friend, I will settle all that. I
will take it on myself alone!”

“Aramis!”

“No, no, Porthos, I conjure you, let me act. No false generosity! No
inopportune devotedness! You knew nothing of my projects. You have done
nothing of yourself. With me it is different. I alone am the author of
this plot. I stood in need of my inseparable companion; I called upon
you, and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device, ‘All for
one, one for all.’ My crime is that I was an egotist.”

“Now, that is a word I like,” said Porthos; “and seeing that you have
acted entirely for yourself, it is impossible for me to blame you. It is
natural.”

And upon this sublime reflection, Porthos pressed his friend’s hand
cordially.

In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul, Aramis felt his own
littleness. It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before
real superiority of heart, which is more imposing than brilliancy of
mind. He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of
his friend.

“Now,” said Porthos, “that we have come to an explanation, now that I am
perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV., I think, my
friend, it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which
we are the victims--for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at
the bottom of all this.”

“D’Artagnan, my good Porthos, D’Artagnan is coming, and will detail it
to you in all its circumstances; but, excuse me, I am deeply grieved, I
am bowed down with mental anguish, and I have need of all my presence
of mind, all my powers of reflection, to extricate you from the false
position in which I have so imprudently involved you; but nothing can be
more clear, nothing more plain, than your position, henceforth. The king
Louis XIV. has no longer now but one enemy: that enemy is myself,
myself alone. I have made you a prisoner, you have followed me, to-day
I liberate you, you fly back to your prince. You can perceive, Porthos,
there is not one difficulty in all this.”

“Do you think so?” said Porthos.

“I am quite sure of it.”

“Then why,” said the admirable good sense of Porthos, “then why, if
we are in such an easy position, why, my friend, do we prepare cannon,
muskets, and engines of all sorts? It seems to me it would be much
more simple to say to Captain d’Artagnan: ‘My dear friend, we have been
mistaken; that error is to be repaired; open the door to us, let us pass
through, and we will say good-bye.’”

“Ah! that!” said Aramis, shaking his head.

“Why do you say ‘that’? Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?”

“I see a difficulty in it.”

“What is it?”

“The hypothesis that D’Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige
us to defend ourselves.”

“What! defend ourselves against D’Artagnan? Folly! Against the good
D’Artagnan!”

Aramis once more replied by shaking his head.

“Porthos,” at length said he, “if I have had the matches lighted and
the guns pointed, if I have had the signal of alarm sounded, if I have
called every man to his post upon the ramparts, those good ramparts of
Belle-Isle which you have so well fortified, it was not for nothing.
Wait to judge; or rather, no, do not wait--”

“What can I do?”

“If I knew, my friend, I would have told you.”

“But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves:--a
boat, and away for France--where--”

“My dear friend,” said Aramis, smiling with a strong shade of sadness,
“do not let us reason like children; let us be men in council and in
execution.--But, hark! I hear a hail for landing at the port. Attention,
Porthos, serious attention!”

“It is D’Artagnan, no doubt,” said Porthos, in a voice of thunder,
approaching the parapet.

“Yes, it is I,” replied the captain of the musketeers, running lightly
up the steps of the mole, and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on
which his two friends waited for him. As soon as he came towards them,
Porthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed D’Artagnan, treading
apparently in his very steps. The captain stopped upon the stairs of the
mole, when half-way up. His companions imitated him.

“Make your men draw back,” cried D’Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis; “let
them retire out of hearing.” This order, given by Porthos, was executed
immediately. Then D’Artagnan, turning towards him who followed him:

“Monsieur,” said he, “we are no longer on board the king’s fleet, where,
in virtue of your order, you spoke so arrogantly to me, just now.”

“Monsieur,” replied the officer, “I did not speak arrogantly to you; I
simply, but rigorously, obeyed instructions. I was commanded to follow
you. I follow you. I am directed not to allow you to communicate with
any one without taking cognizance of what you do; I am in duty bound,
accordingly, to overhear your conversations.”

D’Artagnan trembled with rage, and Porthos and Aramis, who heard this
dialogue, trembled likewise, but with uneasiness and fear. D’Artagnan,
biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him
exasperation, closely to be followed by an explosion, approached the
officer.

“Monsieur,” said he, in a low voice, so much the more impressive, that,
affecting calm, it threatened tempest--“monsieur, when I sent a canoe
hither, you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle.
You produced an order to that effect; and, in my turn, I instantly
showed you the note I had written. When the skipper of the boat sent by
me returned, when I received the reply of these two gentlemen” (and
he pointed to Aramis and Porthos), “you heard every word of what the
messenger said. All that was plainly in your orders, all that was well
executed, very punctually, was it not?”

“Yes, monsieur,” stammered the officer; “yes, without doubt, but--”

“Monsieur,” continued D’Artagnan, growing warm--“monsieur, when I
manifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle,
you demanded to accompany me; I did not hesitate; I brought you with me.
You are now at Belle-Isle, are you not?”

“Yes, monsieur; but--”

“But--the question no longer is of M. Colbert, who has given you that
order, or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions;
the question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d’Artagnan, and who
is alone with M. d’Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty
feet of salt water; a bad position for that man, a bad position,
monsieur! I warn you.”

“But, monsieur, if I am a restraint upon you,” said the officer,
timidly, and almost faintly, “it is my duty which--”

“Monsieur, you have had the misfortune, either you or those that sent
you, to insult me. It is done. I cannot seek redress from those who
employ you,--they are unknown to me, or are at too great a distance. But
you are under my hand, and I swear that if you make one step behind me
when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen, I swear to you by my
name, I will cleave your head in two with my sword, and pitch you into
the water. Oh! it will happen! it will happen! I have only been six
times angry in my life, monsieur, and all five preceding times _I killed
my man_.”

The officer did not stir; he became pale under this terrible threat, but
replied with simplicity, “Monsieur, you are wrong in acting against my
orders.”

Porthos and Aramis, mute and trembling at the top of the parapet, cried
to the musketeer, “Good D’Artagnan, take care!”

D’Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence, raised his foot with
ominous calmness to mount the stair, and turned round, sword in hand,
to see if the officer followed him. The officer made a sign of the cross
and stepped up. Porthos and Aramis, who knew their D’Artagnan, uttered
a cry, and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already
heard. But D’Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand,--

“Monsieur,” said he to the officer, in an agitated voice, “you are a
brave man. You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to
you now.”

“Speak, Monsieur d’Artagnan, speak,” replied the officer.

“These gentlemen we have just seen, and against whom you have orders,
are my friends.”

“I know they are, monsieur.”

“You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your
instructions prescribe.”

“I understand your reserve.”

“Very well; permit me, then, to converse with them without a witness.”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan, if I yield to your request, if I do that which
you beg me, I break my word; but if I do not do it, I disoblige you. I
prefer the one dilemma to the other. Converse with your friends, and do
not despise me, monsieur, for doing this for _your_ sake, whom I esteem
and honor; do not despise me for committing for you, and you alone, an
unworthy act.” D’Artagnan, much agitated, threw his arm round the
neck of the young man, and then went up to his friends. The officer,
enveloped in his cloak, sat down on the damp, weed-covered steps.

“Well!” said D’Artagnan to his friends, “such is my position, judge for
yourselves.” All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth.

“What is the meaning of all these preparations?” said Porthos.

“You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify,” said D’Artagnan.

“Not any, I assure you, my dear captain; for, in fact, I have done
nothing, no more has Aramis,” the worthy baron hastened to say.

D’Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate, which penetrated
that hardened heart.

“Dear Porthos!” cried the bishop of Vannes.

“You see what is being done against you,” said D’Artagnan; “interception
of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle. Your means of transport
seized. If you had endeavored to fly, you would have fallen into the
hands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions, on the
watch for you. The king wants you to be taken, and he will take you.”
 D’Artagnan tore at his gray mustache. Aramis grew somber, Porthos angry.

“My idea was this,” continued D’Artagnan: “to make you both come on
board, to keep you near me, and restore you your liberty. But now, who
can say, when I return to my ship, I may not find a superior; that I may
not find secret orders which will take from me my command, and give it
to another, who will dispose of me and you without hope of help?”

“We must remain at Belle-Isle,” said Aramis, resolutely; “and I assure
you, for my part, I will not surrender easily.” Porthos said nothing.
D’Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend.

“I have another trial to make of this officer, of this brave fellow who
accompanies me, and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy;
for it denotes an honest man, who, though an enemy, is a thousand times
better than a complaisant coward. Let us try to learn from him what his
instructions are, and what his orders permit or forbid.”

“Let us try,” said Aramis.

D’Artagnan went to the parapet, leaned over towards the steps of the
mole, and called the officer, who immediately came up. “Monsieur,”
 said D’Artagnan, after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural
between gentlemen who know and appreciate each other, “monsieur, if I
wished to take away these gentlemen from here, what would you do?”

“I should not oppose it, monsieur; but having direct explicit orders to
put them under guard, I should detain them.”

“Ah!” said D’Artagnan.

“That’s all over,” said Aramis, gloomily. Porthos did not stir.

“But still take Porthos,” said the bishop of Vannes. “He can prove to
the king, and I will help him do so, and you too, Monsieur d’Artagnan,
that he had nothing to do with this affair.”

“Hum!” said D’Artagnan. “Will you come? Will you follow me, Porthos? The
king is merciful.”

“I want time for reflection,” said Porthos.

“You will remain here, then?”

“Until fresh orders,” said Aramis, with vivacity.

“Until we have an idea,” resumed D’Artagnan; “and I now believe that
will not be long, for I have one already.”

“Let us say adieu, then,” said Aramis; “but in truth, my good Porthos,
you ought to go.”

“No,” said the latter, laconically.

“As you please,” replied Aramis, a little wounded in his
susceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion. “Only I am
reassured by the promise of an idea from D’Artagnan, an idea I fancy I
have divined.”

“Let us see,” said the musketeer, placing his ear near Aramis’s mouth.
The latter spoke several words rapidly, to which D’Artagnan replied,
“That is it, precisely.”

“Infallible!” cried Aramis.

“During the first emotion this resolution will cause, take care of
yourself, Aramis.”

“Oh! don’t be afraid.”

“Now, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan to the officer, “thanks, a thousand
thanks! You have made yourself three friends for life.”

“Yes,” added Aramis. Porthos alone said nothing, but merely bowed.

D’Artagnan, having tenderly embraced his two old friends, left
Belle-Isle with the inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had
saddled him. Thus, with the exception of the explanation with which the
worthy Porthos had been willing to be satisfied, nothing had changed in
appearance in the fate of one or the other, “Only,” said Aramis, “there
is D’Artagnan’s idea.”

D’Artagnan did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea
he had discovered. Now, we know that whatever D’Artagnan did examine,
according to custom, daylight was certain to illuminate. As to the
officer, now grown mute again, he had full time for meditation.
Therefore, on putting his foot on board his vessel, moored within
cannon-shot of the island, the captain of the musketeers had already got
together all his means, offensive and defensive.

He immediately assembled his council, which consisted of the officers
serving under his orders. These were eight in number; a chief of the
maritime forces; a major directing the artillery; an engineer, the
officer we are acquainted with, and four lieutenants. Having assembled
them, D’Artagnan arose, took of his hat, and addressed them thus:

“Gentlemen, I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and I have
found in it a good and solid garrison; moreover, preparations are made
for a defense that may prove troublesome. I therefore intend to send for
two of the principal officers of the place, that we may converse with
them. Having separated them from their troops and cannon, we shall be
better able to deal with them; particularly by reasoning with them. Is
not this your opinion, gentlemen?”

The major of artillery rose.

“Monsieur,” said he, with respect, but firmness, “I have heard you say
that the place is preparing to make a troublesome defense. The place is
then, as you know, determined on rebellion?”

D’Artagnan was visibly put out by this reply; but he was not the man to
allow himself to be subdued by a trifle, and resumed:

“Monsieur,” said he, “your reply is just. But you are ignorant that
Belle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet’s, and that former monarchs gave the
right to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their people.” The major
made a movement. “Oh! do not interrupt me,” continued D’Artagnan. “You
are going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against the
English was not a right to arm themselves against their king. But it is
not M. Fouquet, I suppose, who holds Belle-Isle at this moment, since
I arrested M. Fouquet the day before yesterday. Now the inhabitants and
defenders of Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest. You would announce
it to them in vain. It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary, so
unexpected, that they would not believe you. A Breton serves his master,
and not his masters; he serves his master till he has seen him dead. Now
the Bretons, as far as I know, have not seen the body of M. Fouquet. It
is not, then, surprising they hold out against that which is neither M.
Fouquet nor his signature.”

The major bowed in token of assent.

“That is why,” continued D’Artagnan, “I propose to cause two of the
principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel. They will
see you, gentlemen; they will see the forces we have at our disposal;
they will consequently know to what they have to trust, and the fate
that attends them, in case of rebellion. We will affirm to them, upon
our honor, that M. Fouquet is a prisoner, and that all resistance can
only be prejudicial to them. We will tell them that at the first cannon
fired, there will be no further hope of mercy from the king. Then, or so
at least I trust, they will resist no longer. They will yield up without
fighting, and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way
which it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue.”

The officer who had followed D’Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to
speak, but D’Artagnan interrupted him.

“Yes, I know what you are going to tell me, monsieur; I know that there
is an order of the king’s to prevent all secret communications with
the defenders of Belle-Isle, and that is exactly why I do not offer to
communicate except in presence of my staff.”

And D’Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers, who knew
him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension.

The officers looked at each other as if to read each other’s opinions in
their eyes, with the intention of evidently acting, should they agree,
according to the desire of D’Artagnan. And already the latter saw with
joy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos
and Aramis, when the king’s officer drew from a pocket a folded paper,
which he placed in the hands of D’Artagnan.

This paper bore upon its superscription the number 1.

“What, more!” murmured the surprised captain.

“Read, monsieur,” said the officer, with a courtesy that was not free
from sadness.

D’Artagnan, full of mistrust, unfolded the paper, and read these words:
“Prohibition to M. d’Artagnan to assemble any council whatever, or to
deliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners
shot. Signed--LOUIS.”

D’Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole
body, and with a gracious smile:

“That is well, monsieur,” said he; “the king’s orders shall be complied
with.”



Chapter XLIV. Result of the Ideas of the King, and the Ideas of
D’Artagnan.

The blow was direct. It was severe, mortal. D’Artagnan, furious at
having been anticipated by an idea of the king’s, did not despair,
however, even yet; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from
Belle-Isle, he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends.

“Gentlemen,” said he, suddenly, “since the king has charged some other
than myself with his secret orders, it must be because I no longer
possess his confidence, and I should really be unworthy of it if I had
the courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions.
Therefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king.
I tender it before you all, enjoining you all to fall back with me upon
the coast of France, in such a way as not to compromise the safety of
the forces his majesty has confided to me. For this purpose, return all
to your posts; within an hour, we shall have the ebb of the tide. To
your posts, gentlemen! I suppose,” added he, on seeing that all prepared
to obey him, except the surveillant officer, “you have no orders to
object, this time?”

And D’Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words. This plan
would prove the safety of his friends. The blockade once raised, they
might embark immediately, and set sail for England or Spain, without
fear of being molested. Whilst they were making their escape, D’Artagnan
would return to the king; would justify his return by the indignation
which the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him; he would be sent back
with full powers, and he would take Belle-Isle; that is to say, the
cage, after the birds had flown. But to this plan the officer opposed a
further order of the king’s. It was thus conceived:

“From the moment M. d’Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of
giving in his resignation, he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the
expedition, and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to
no longer obey him. Moreover, the said Monsieur d’Artagnan, having lost
that quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle, shall set
out immediately for France, accompanied by the officer who will have
remitted the message to him, and who will consider him a prisoner for
whom he is answerable.”

Brave and careless as he was, D’Artagnan turned pale. Everything had
been calculated with a depth of precognition which, for the first time
in thirty years, recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible
logic of the great cardinal. He leaned his head on his hand, thoughtful,
scarcely breathing. “If I were to put this order in my pocket,” thought
he, “who would know it, what would prevent my doing it? Before the king
had had time to be informed, I should have saved those poor fellows
yonder. Let us exercise some small audacity! My head is not one of those
the executioner strikes off for disobedience. We will disobey!” But at
the moment he was about to adopt this plan, he saw the officers around
him reading similar orders, which the passive agent of the thoughts of
that infernal Colbert had distributed to them. This contingency of his
disobedience had been foreseen--as all the rest had been.

“Monsieur,” said the officer, coming up to him, “I await your good
pleasure to depart.”

“I am ready, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, grinding his teeth.

The officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d’Artagnan and
himself. At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage.

“How,” stammered he, “will you carry on the directions of the different
corps?”

“When you are gone, monsieur,” replied the commander of the fleet, “it
is to me the command of the whole is committed.”

“Then, monsieur,” rejoined Colbert’s man, addressing the new leader, “it
is for you that this last order remitted to me is intended. Let us see
your powers.”

“Here they are,” said the officer, exhibiting the royal signature.

“Here are your instructions,” replied the officer, placing the folded
paper in his hands; and turning round towards D’Artagnan, “Come,
monsieur,” said he, in an agitated voice (such despair did he behold in
that man of iron), “do me the favor to depart at once.”

“Immediately!” articulated D’Artagnan, feebly, subdued, crushed by
implacable impossibility.

And he painfully subsided into the little boat, which started, favored
by wind and tide, for the coast of France. The king’s guards embarked
with him. The musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes
quickly, and of pleading the cause of his friends eloquently enough
to incline the king to mercy. The bark flew like a swallow. D’Artagnan
distinctly saw the land of France profiled in black against the white
clouds of night.

“Ah! monsieur,” said he, in a low voice, to the officer to whom, for
an hour, he had ceased speaking, “what would I give to know the
instructions for the new commander! They are all pacific, are they not?
and--”

He did not finish; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the
waves, another, and two or three still louder. D’Artagnan shuddered.

“They have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle,” replied the officer. The
canoe had just touched the soil of France.



Chapter XLV. The Ancestors of Porthos.

When D’Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos, the latter returned to the
principal fort, in order to converse with greater liberty. Porthos,
still thoughtful, was a restraint on Aramis, whose mind had never felt
itself more free.

“Dear Porthos,” said he, suddenly, “I will explain D’Artagnan’s idea to
you.”

“What idea, Aramis?”

“An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours.”

“Ah! indeed!” said Porthos, much astonished. “Let us hear it.”

“Did you remark, in the scene our friend had with the officer, that
certain orders constrained him with regard to us?”

“Yes, I did notice that.”

“Well! D’Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king, and
during the confusion that will result from his absence, we will get
away, or rather you will get away, Porthos, if there is possibility of
flight for only one.”

Here Porthos shook his head and replied: “We will escape together,
Aramis, or we will stay together.”

“Thine is a right, a generous heart,” said Aramis, “only your melancholy
uneasiness affects me.”

“I am not uneasy,” said Porthos.

“Then you are angry with me.”

“I am not angry with you.”

“Then why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?”

“I will tell you; I am making my will.” And while saying these words,
the good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis.

“Your will!” cried the bishop. “What, then! do you think yourself lost?”

“I feel fatigued. It is the first time, and there is a custom in our
family.”

“What is it, my friend?”

“My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am.”

“Indeed!” said Aramis; “then your grandfather must have been Samson
himself.”

“No; his name was Antoine. Well! he was about my age, when, setting
out one day for the chase, he felt his legs weak, the man who had never
known what weakness was before.”

“What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?”

“Nothing good, as you will see; for having set out, complaining still of
weakness of the legs, he met a wild boar, which made head against him;
he missed him with his arquebuse, and was ripped up by the beast and
died immediately.”

“There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself, dear
Porthos.”

“Oh! you will see. My father was as strong again as I am. He was a rough
soldier, under Henry III. and Henry IV.; his name was not Antoine, but
Gaspard, the same as M. de Coligny. Always on horseback, he had never
known what lassitude was. One evening, as he rose from table, his legs
failed him.”

“He had supped heartily, perhaps,” said Aramis, “and that was why he
staggered.”

“Bah! A friend of M. de Bassompierre, nonsense! No, no, he was
astonished at this lassitude, and said to my mother, who laughed at him,
‘Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar, as the late
M. du Vallon, my father did?’”

“Well?” said Aramis.

“Well, having this weakness, my father insisted upon going down into the
garden, instead of going to bed; his foot slipped on the first stair,
the staircase was steep; my father fell against a stone in which an iron
hinge was fixed. The hinge gashed his temple; and he was stretched out
dead upon the spot.”

Aramis raised his eyes to his friend: “These are two extraordinary
circumstances,” said he; “let us not infer that there may succeed a
third. It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious,
my brave Porthos. Besides, when were your legs known to fail? Never have
you stood so firm, so haughtily; why, you could carry a house on your
shoulders.”

“At this moment,” said Porthos, “I feel myself pretty active; but at
times I vacillate; I sink; and lately this phenomenon, as you say, has
occurred four times. I will not say this frightens me, but it annoys me.
Life is an agreeable thing. I have money; I have fine estates; I have
horses that I love; I have also friends that I love: D’Artagnan, Athos,
Raoul, and you.”

The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in
the very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship.
Aramis pressed his hand: “We will still live many years,” said he, “to
preserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men. Trust yourself
to me, my friend; we have no reply from D’Artagnan, that is a good sign.
He must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the
seas. On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be
rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria, which
you know, where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes.”

“Yes, and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we
discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way.”

“Precisely. In case of misfortunes, a bark is to be concealed for us in
that cavern; indeed, it must be there by this time. We will wait for a
favorable moment, and during the night we will go to sea!”

“That is a grand idea. What shall we gain by it?”

“We shall gain this--nobody knows that grotto, or rather its issue,
except ourselves and two or three hunters of the island; we shall gain
this--that if the island is occupied, the scouts, seeing no bark upon
the shore, will never imagine we can escape, and will cease to watch.”

“I understand.”

“Well! that weakness in the legs?”

“Oh! better, much, just now.”

“You see, then, plainly, that everything conspires to give us quietude
and hope. D’Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free. No royal
fleet or descent to be dreaded. _Vive Dieu!_ Porthos, we have still
half a century of magnificent adventure before us, and if I once touch
Spanish ground, I swear to you,” added the bishop with terrible energy,
“that your brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be.”

“We live by hope,” said Porthos, enlivened by the warmth of his
companion.

All at once a cry resounded in their ears: “To arms! to arms!”

This cry, repeated by a hundred throats, piercing the chamber where the
two friends were conversing, carried surprise to one, and uneasiness to
the other. Aramis opened the window; he saw a crowd of people running
with flambeaux. Women were seeking places of safety, the armed
population were hastening to their posts.

“The fleet! the fleet!” cried a soldier, who recognized Aramis.

“The fleet?” repeated the latter.

“Within half cannon-shot,” continued the soldier.

“To arms!” cried Aramis.

“To arms!” repeated Porthos, formidably. And both rushed forth towards
the mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries. Boats,
laden with soldiers, were seen approaching; and in three directions, for
the purpose of landing at three points at once.

“What must be done?” said an officer of the guard.

“Stop them; and if they persist, fire!” said Aramis.

Five minutes later, the cannonade commenced. These were the shots that
D’Artagnan had heard as he landed in France. But the boats were too
near the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly. They landed, and the
combat commenced hand to hand.

“What’s the matter, Porthos?” said Aramis to his friend.

“Nothing! nothing!--only my legs; it is really incomprehensible!--they
will be better when we charge.” In fact, Porthos and Aramis did
charge with such vigor, and so thoroughly animated their men, that the
royalists re-embarked precipitately, without gaining anything but the
wounds they carried away.

“Eh! but Porthos,” cried Aramis, “we must have a prisoner, quick!
quick!” Porthos bent over the stair of the mole, and seized by the nape
of the neck one of the officers of the royal army who was waiting to
embark till all his people should be in the boat. The arm of the giant
lifted up his prey, which served him as a buckler, and he recovered
himself without a shot being fired at him.

“Here is a prisoner for you,” said Porthos coolly to Aramis.

“Well!” cried the latter, laughing, “did you not calumniate your legs?”

“It was not with my legs I captured him,” said Porthos, “it was with my
arms!”



Chapter XLVI. The Son of Biscarrat.

The Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory; Aramis did not
encourage them in the feeling.

“What will happen,” said he to Porthos, when everybody was gone home,
“will be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the
resistance; and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when
they are taken, which cannot fail to take place.”

“From which it results, then,” said Porthos, “that what we have done is
of not the slightest use.”

“For the moment it may be,” replied the bishop, “for we have a prisoner
from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do.”

“Yes, let us interrogate the prisoner,” said Porthos, “and the means of
making him speak are very simple. We are going to supper; we will invite
him to join us; as he drinks he will talk.”

This was done. The officer was at first rather uneasy, but became
reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with. He gave,
without having any fear of compromising himself, all the details
imaginable of the resignation and departure of D’Artagnan. He explained
how, after that departure, the new leader of the expedition had ordered
a surprise upon Belle-Isle. There his explanations stopped. Aramis
and Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair. No more
dependence to be placed now on D’Artagnan’s fertile imagination--no
further resource in the event of defeat. Aramis, continuing his
interrogations, asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition
contemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle.

“The orders are,” replied he, “to kill _during_ combat, or hang
_afterwards_.”

Porthos and Aramis looked at each other again, and the color mounted to
their faces.

“I am too light for the gallows,” replied Aramis; “people like me are
not hung.”

“And I am too heavy,” said Porthos; “people like me break the cord.”

“I am sure,” said the prisoner, gallantly, “that we could have
guaranteed you the exact kind of death you preferred.”

“A thousand thanks!” said Aramis, seriously. Porthos bowed.

“One more cup of wine to your health,” said he, drinking himself. From
one subject to another the chat with the officer was prolonged. He was
an intelligent gentleman, and suffered himself to be led on by the charm
of Aramis’s wit and Porthos’s cordial _bonhomie_.

“Pardon me,” said he, “if I address a question to you; but men who are
in their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little.”

“Address it!” cried Porthos; “address it!”

“Speak,” said Aramis.

“Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?”

“Yes, monsieur, and amongst the best of them, if you please,” said
Porthos.

“That is true; I should say even the best of all soldiers, messieurs, if
I did not fear to offend the memory of my father.”

“Of your father?” cried Aramis.

“Do you know what my name is?”

“_Ma foi!_ no, monsieur; but you can tell us, and--”

“I am called Georges de Biscarrat.”

“Oh!” cried Porthos, in his turn. “Biscarrat! Do you remember that name,
Aramis?”

“Biscarrat!” reflected the bishop. “It seems to me--”

“Try to recollect, monsieur,” said the officer.

“_Pardieu!_ that won’t take me long,” said Porthos. “Biscarrat--called
Cardinal--one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we
formed our friendship with D’Artagnan, sword in hand.”

“Precisely, gentlemen.”

“The only one,” cried Aramis, eagerly, “we could not scratch.”

“Consequently, a capital blade?” said the prisoner.

“That’s true! most true!” exclaimed both friends together. “_Ma foi!_
Monsieur Biscarrat, we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a
brave man’s son.”

Biscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers. Aramis
looked at Porthos as much as to say, “Here is a man who will help us,”
 and without delay,--“Confess, monsieur,” said he, “that it is good to
have once been a good man.”

“My father always said so, monsieur.”

“Confess, likewise, that it is a sad circumstance in which you find
yourself, of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung, and
to learn that these men are old acquaintances, in fact, hereditary
friends.”

“Oh! you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that, messieurs
and friends!” said the young man, warmly.

“Bah! you said so yourself.”

“I said so just now, when I did not know you; but now that I know you, I
say--you will evade this dismal fate, if you wish!”

“How--if we wish?” echoed Aramis, whose eyes beamed with intelligence as
he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos.

“Provided,” continued Porthos, looking, in his turn, with noble
intrepidity, at M. Biscarrat and the bishop--“provided nothing
disgraceful be required of us.”

“Nothing at all will be required of you, gentlemen,” replied the
officer--“what should they ask of you? If they find you they will kill
you, that is a predetermined thing; try, then, gentlemen, to prevent
their finding you.”

“I don’t think I am mistaken,” said Porthos, with dignity; “but it
appears evident to me that if they want to find us, they must come and
seek us here.”

“In that you are perfectly right, my worthy friend,” replied Aramis,
constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat, who
had grown silent and constrained. “You wish, Monsieur de Biscarrat, to
say something to us, to make us some overture, and you dare not--is that
true?”

“Ah! gentlemen and friends! it is because by speaking I betray the
watchword. But, hark! I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it.”

“Cannon!” said Porthos.

“Cannon and musketry, too!” cried the bishop.

On hearing at a distance, among the rocks, these sinister reports of a
combat which they thought had ceased:

“What can that be?” asked Porthos.

“Eh! _Pardieu!_” cried Aramis; “that is just what I expected.”

“What is that?”

“That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint; is not that true,
monsieur? And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed,
you were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the
island.”

“Oh! several, monsieur.”

“We are lost, then,” said the bishop of Vannes, quietly.

“Lost! that is possible,” replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, “but we
are not taken or hung.” And so saying, he rose from the table, went to
the wall, and coolly took down his sword and pistols, which he examined
with the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle, and who
feels that life, in a great measure, depends upon the excellence and
right conditions of his arms.

At the report of the cannon, at the news of the surprise which might
deliver up the island to the royal troops, the terrified crowd rushed
precipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their
leaders. Aramis, pale and downcast, between two flambeaux, showed
himself at the window which looked into the principal court, full of
soldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor.

“My friends,” said D’Herblay, in a grave and sonorous voice, “M.
Fouquet, your protector, your friend, you father, has been arrested by
an order of the king, and thrown into the Bastile.” A sustained yell of
vengeful fury came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood,
and enveloped him in a magnetic field.

“Avenge Monsieur Fouquet!” cried the most excited of his hearers, “death
to the royalists!”

“No, my friends,” replied Aramis, solemnly; “no, my friends; no
resistance. The king is master in his kingdom. The king is the mandatory
of God. The king and God have struck M. Fouquet. Humble yourselves
before the hand of God. Love God and the king, who have struck M.
Fouquet. But do not avenge your seigneur, do not think of avenging him.
You would sacrifice yourselves in vain--you, your wives and children,
your property, your liberty. Lay down your arms, my friends--lay down
your arms! since the king commands you so to do--and retire peaceably to
your dwellings. It is I who ask you to do so; it is I who beg you to do
so; it is I who now, in the hour of need, command you to do so, in the
name of M. Fouquet.”

The crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger
and terror. “The soldiers of Louis XIV. have reached the island,”
 continued Aramis. “From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt
them and you--it would be a massacre. Begone, then, begone, and forget;
this time I command you, in the name of the Lord of Hosts!”

The mutineers retired slowly, submissive, silent.

“Ah! what have you just been saying, my friend?” said Porthos.

“Monsieur,” said Biscarrat to the bishop, “you may save all these
inhabitants, but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend.”

“Monsieur de Biscarrat,” said the bishop of Vannes, with a singular
accent of nobility and courtesy, “Monsieur de Biscarrat, be kind enough
to resume your liberty.”

“I am very willing to do so, monsieur; but--”

“That would render us a service, for when announcing to the king’s
lieutenant the submission of the islanders, you will perhaps obtain some
grace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has
been effected.”

“Grace!” replied Porthos with flashing eyes, “what is the meaning of
that word?”

Aramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly, as he had been
accustomed to do in the days of their youth, when he wanted to warn
Porthos that he had committed, or was about to commit, a blunder.
Porthos understood him, and was silent immediately.

“I will go, messieurs,” replied Biscarrat, a little surprised likewise
at the word “grace” pronounced by the haughty musketeer, of and to whom,
but a few minutes before, he had related with so much enthusiasm the
heroic exploits with which his father had delighted him.

“Go, then, Monsieur Biscarrat,” said Aramis, bowing to him, “and at
parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude.”

“But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends,
since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of
you in the meantime?” replied the officer, very much agitated at taking
leave of the two ancient adversaries of his father.

“We will wait here.”

“But, _mon Dieu!_--the order is precise and formal.”

“I am bishop of Vannes, Monsieur de Biscarrat; and they no more shoot a
bishop than they hang a gentleman.”

“Ah! yes, monsieur--yes, monseigneur,” replied Biscarrat; “it is true,
you are right, there is still that chance for you. Then, I will depart,
I will repair to the commander of the expedition, the king’s lieutenant.
Adieu! then, messieurs, or rather, to meet again, I hope.”

The worthy officer, jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis, departed
in the direction of the sound of cannon, which, by surging the crowd
into the fort, had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with
their prisoner. Aramis watched the departure, and when left alone with
Porthos:

“Well, do you comprehend?” said he.

“_Ma foi!_ no.”

“Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here?”

“No; he is a brave fellow.”

“Yes; but the grotto of Locmaria--is it necessary all the world should
know it?”

“Ah! that is true, that is true; I comprehend. We are going to escape by
the cavern.”

“If you please,” cried Aramis, gayly. “Forward, friend Porthos; our boat
awaits us. King Louis has not caught us--_yet_.”



Chapter XLVII. The Grotto of Locmaria.

The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render
it necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to
reach it. Besides, night was advancing; midnight had struck at the fort.
Porthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms. They walked, then,
across the heath, which stretched between the mole and the cavern,
listening to every noise, in order better to avoid an ambush. From time
to time, on the road which they had carefully left on their left, passed
fugitives coming from the interior, at the news of the landing of the
royal troops. Aramis and Porthos, concealed behind some projecting mass
of rock, collected the words that escaped from the poor people, who
fled, trembling, carrying with them their most valuable effects, and
tried, whilst listening to their complaints, to gather something from
them for their own interest. At length, after a rapid race, frequently
interrupted by prudent stoppages, they reached the deep grottoes, in
which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a
bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season.

“My good friend,” said Porthos, panting vigorously, “we have arrived, it
seems. But I thought you spoke of three men, three servants, who were to
accompany us. I don’t see them--where are they?”

“Why should you see them, Porthos?” replied Aramis. “They are certainly
waiting for us in the cavern, and, no doubt, are resting, having
accomplished their rough and difficult task.”

Aramis stopped Porthos, who was preparing to enter the cavern. “Will you
allow me, my friend,” said he to the giant, “to pass in first? I know
the signal I have given to these men; who, not hearing it, would be very
likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark.”

“Go on, then, Aramis; go on--go first; you impersonate wisdom and
foresight; go. Ah! there is that fatigue again, of which I spoke to you.
It has just seized me afresh.”

Aramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto, and bowing
his head, he penetrated into the interior of the cavern, imitating the
cry of the owl. A little plaintive cooing, a scarcely distinct echo,
replied from the depths of the cave. Aramis pursued his way cautiously,
and soon was stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered,
within ten paces of him.

“Are you there, Yves?” said the bishop.

“Yes, monseigneur; Goenne is here likewise. His son accompanies us.”

“That is well. Are all things ready?”

“Yes, monseigneur.”

“Go to the entrance of the grottoes, my good Yves, and you will there
find the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, who is resting after the fatigue of
our journey. And if he should happen not to be able to walk, lift him
up, and bring him hither to me.”

The three men obeyed. But the recommendation given to his servants was
superfluous. Porthos, refreshed, had already commenced the descent, and
his heavy step resounded amongst the cavities, formed and supported by
columns of porphyry and granite. As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had
rejoined the bishop, the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were
furnished, and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again
as ever.

“Let us inspect the boat,” said Aramis, “and satisfy ourselves at once
what it will hold.”

“Do not go too near with the light,” said the patron Yves; “for as you
desired me, monseigneur, I have placed under the bench of the poop, in
the coffer you know of, the barrel of powder, and the musket-charges
that you sent me from the fort.”

“Very well,” said Aramis; and, taking the lantern himself, he examined
minutely all parts of the canoe, with the precautions of a man who is
neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger. The canoe was long,
light, drawing little water, thin of keel; in short, one of those that
have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle; a little high in its
sides, solid upon the water, very manageable, furnished with planks
which, in uncertain weather, formed a sort of deck over which the waves
might glide, so as to protect the rowers. In two well-closed coffers,
placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop, Aramis found bread,
biscuit, dried fruits, a quarter of bacon, a good provision of water in
leathern bottles; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who
did not mean to quit the coast, and would be able to revictual, if
necessity commanded. The arms, eight muskets, and as many horse-pistols,
were in good condition, and all loaded. There were additional oars, in
case of accident, and that little sail called _trinquet_, which assists
the speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row, and is so
useful when the breeze is slack. When Aramis had seen to all these
things, and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection, “Let
us consult Porthos,” said he, “to know if we must endeavor to get the
boat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto, following the descent
and the shade of the cavern, or whether it be better, in the open air,
to make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes, leveling the road
of the little beach, which is but twenty feet high, and gives, at high
tide, three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom.”

“It must be as you please, monseigneur,” replied the skipper Yves,
respectfully; “but I don’t believe that by the slope of the cavern, and
in the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat, the road
will be so convenient as the open air. I know the beach well, and can
certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden; the
interior of the grotto, on the contrary, is rough; without reckoning,
monseigneur, that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which
leads into the sea, and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it.”

“I have made my calculation,” said the bishop, “and I am certain it will
pass.”

“So be it; I wish it may, monseigneur,” continued Yves; “but your
highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the
trench, there is an enormous stone to be lifted--that under which the
fox always passes, and which closes the trench like a door.”

“It can be raised,” said Porthos; “that is nothing.”

“Oh! I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men,” replied Yves;
“but that is giving him a great deal of trouble.”

“I think the skipper may be right,” said Aramis; “let us try the
open-air passage.”

“The more so, monseigneur,” continued the fisherman, “that we should not
be able to embark before day, it will require so much labor, and that
as soon as daylight appears, a good _vedette_ placed outside the grotto
would be necessary, indispensable even, to watch the maneuvers of the
lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us.”

“Yes, yes, Yves, your reasons are good; we will go by the beach.”

And the three robust Bretons went to the boat, and were beginning to
place their rollers underneath it to put it in motion, when the distant
barking of dogs was heard, proceeding from the interior of the island.

Aramis darted out of the grotto, followed by Porthos. Dawn just tinted
with purple and white the waves and plain; through the dim light,
melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles,
and long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the
shimmering fields of buckwheat. In a quarter of an hour it would be
clear daylight; the wakened birds announced it to all nature. The
barkings which had been heard, which had stopped the three fishermen
engaged in moving the boat, and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of
the cavern, now seemed to come from a deep gorge within about a league
of the grotto.

“It is a pack of hounds,” said Porthos; “the dogs are on a scent.”

“Who can be hunting at such a moment as this?” said Aramis.

“And this way, particularly,” continued Porthos, “where they might
expect the army of the royalists.”

“The noise comes nearer. Yes, you are right, Porthos, the dogs are on a
scent. But, Yves!” cried Aramis, “come here! come here!”

Yves ran towards him, letting fall the cylinder which he was about to
place under the boat when the bishop’s call interrupted him.

“What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?” said Porthos.

“Eh! monseigneur, I cannot understand it,” replied the Breton. “It is
not at such a moment that the Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt. No, and
yet the dogs--”

“Unless they have escaped from the kennel.”

“No,” said Goenne, “they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria’s hounds.”

“In common prudence,” said Aramis, “let us go back into the grotto; the
voices evidently draw nearer, we shall soon know what we have to trust
to.”

They re-entered, but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the
darkness, when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress
resounded through the cavern, and breathless, rapid, terrified, a fox
passed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives, leaped over
the boat and disappeared, leaving behind its sour scent, which was
perceptible for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave.

“The fox!” cried the Bretons, with the glad surprise of born hunters.

“Accursed mischance!” cried the bishop, “our retreat is discovered.”

“How so?” said Porthos; “are you afraid of a fox?”

“Eh! my friend, what do you mean by that? why do you specify the fox? It
is not the fox alone. _Pardieu!_ But don’t you know, Porthos, that after
the foxes come hounds, and after hounds men?”

Porthos hung his head. As though to confirm the words of Aramis, they
heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail.
Six foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath, with mingling yelps
of triumph.

“There are the dogs, plain enough!” said Aramis, posted on the look-out
behind a chink in the rocks; “now, who are the huntsmen?”

“If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria’s,” replied the sailor, “he will
leave the dogs to hunt the grotto, for he knows them, and will not enter
in himself, being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side;
it is there he will wait for him.”

“It is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting,” replied Aramis,
turning pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance.

“Who is it, then?” said Porthos.

“Look!”

Porthos applied his eye to the slit, and saw at the summit of a hillock
a dozen horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs,
shouting, “_Taiaut! taiaut!_”

“The guards!” said he.

“Yes, my friend, the king’s guards.”

“The king’s guards! do you say, monseigneur?” cried the Bretons, growing
pale in turn.

“With Biscarrat at their head, mounted upon my gray horse,” continued
Aramis.

The hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche,
and the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries.

“Ah! the devil!” said Aramis, resuming all his coolness at the sight of
this certain, inevitable danger. “I am perfectly satisfied we are lost,
but we have, at least, one chance left. If the guards who follow their
hounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto, there is no
help for us, for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat.
The dogs must not go out of the cavern. Their masters must not enter.”

“That is clear,” said Porthos.

“You understand,” added Aramis, with the rapid precision of command;
“there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under
which the fox has glided--but at the too narrow opening of which they
must be themselves stopped and killed.”

The Bretons sprang forward, knife in hand. In a few minutes there was a
lamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls--and then, silence.

“That’s well!” said Aramis, coolly, “now for the masters!”

“What is to be done with them?” said Porthos.

“Wait their arrival, conceal ourselves, and kill them.”

“_Kill them!_” replied Porthos.

“There are sixteen,” said Aramis, “at least, at present.”

“And well armed,” added Porthos, with a smile of consolation.

“It will last about ten minutes,” said Aramis. “To work!”

And with a resolute air he took up a musket, and placed a hunting-knife
between his teeth.

“Yves, Goenne, and his son,” continued Aramis, “will pass the muskets to
us. You, Porthos, will fire when they are close. We shall have brought
down, at the lowest computation, eight, before the others are aware of
anything--that is certain; then all, there are five of us, will dispatch
the other eight, knife in hand.”

“And poor Biscarrat?” said Porthos.

Aramis reflected a moment--“Biscarrat first,” replied he, coolly. “He
knows us.”



Chapter XLVIII. The Grotto.

In spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of
the character of Aramis, the event, subject to the risks of things over
which uncertainty presides, did not fall out exactly as the bishop of
Vannes had foreseen. Biscarrat, better mounted than his companions,
arrived first at the opening of the grotto, and comprehended that
fox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it. Only, struck by that
superstitious terror which every dark and subterraneous way naturally
impresses upon the mind of man, he stopped at the outside of the grotto,
and waited till his companions should have assembled round him.

“Well!” asked the young men, coming up, out of breath, and unable to
understand the meaning of this inaction.

“Well! I cannot hear the dogs; they and the fox must all be lost in this
infernal cavern.”

“They were too close up,” said one of the guards, “to have lost scent
all at once. Besides, we should hear them from one side or another. They
must, as Biscarrat says, be in this grotto.”

“But then,” said one of the young men, “why don’t they give tongue?”

“It is strange!” muttered another.

“Well, but,” said a fourth, “let us go into this grotto. Does it happen
to be forbidden we should enter it?”

“No,” replied Biscarrat. “Only, as it looks as dark as a wolf’s mouth,
we might break our necks in it.”

“Witness the dogs,” said a guard, “who seem to have broken theirs.”

“What the devil can have become of them?” asked the young men in chorus.
And every master called his dog by his name, whistled to him in his
favorite mode, without a single one replying to either call or whistle.

“It is perhaps an enchanted grotto,” said Biscarrat; “let us see.” And,
jumping from his horse, he made a step into the grotto.

“Stop! stop! I will accompany you,” said one of the guards, on seeing
Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern’s mouth.

“No,” replied Biscarrat, “there must be something extraordinary in the
place--don’t let us risk ourselves all at once. If in ten minutes you do
not hear of me, you can come in, but not all at once.”

“Be it so,” said the young man, who, besides, did not imagine that
Biscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise, “we will wait for you.” And
without dismounting from their horses, they formed a circle round the
grotto.

Biscarrat entered then alone, and advanced through the darkness till
he came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos’s musket. The resistance
which his chest met with astonished him; he naturally raised his hand
and laid hold of the icy barrel. At the same instant, Yves lifted a
knife against the young man, which was about to fall upon him with
all force of a Breton’s arm, when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it
half-way. Then, like low muttering thunder, his voice growled in the
darkness, “I will not have him killed!”

Biscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat, the one
almost as terrible as the other. However brave the young man might
be, he could not prevent a cry escaping him, which Aramis immediately
suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth. “Monsieur de
Biscarrat,” said he, in a low voice, “we mean you no harm, and you must
know that if you have recognized us; but, at the first word, the first
groan, the first whisper, we shall be forced to kill you as we have
killed your dogs.”

“Yes, I recognize you, gentlemen,” said the officer, in a low voice.
“But why are you here--what are you doing, here? Unfortunate men! I
thought you were in the fort.”

“And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?”

“I did all I was able, messieurs, but--”

“But what?”

“But there are positive orders.”

“To kill us?”

Biscarrat made no reply. It would have cost him too much to speak of the
cord to gentlemen. Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner.

“Monsieur Biscarrat,” said he, “you would be already dead if we had not
regard for your youth and our ancient association with your father; but
you may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell
your companions what you have seen.”

“I will not only swear that I will not speak of it,” said Biscarrat,
“but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to
prevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto.”

“Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” cried several voices from the outside, coming
like a whirlwind into the cave.

“Reply,” said Aramis.

“Here I am!” cried Biscarrat.

“Now, begone; we depend on your loyalty.” And he left his hold of the
young man, who hastily returned towards the light.

“Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” cried the voices, still nearer. And the shadows
of several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto.
Biscarrat rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them, and met them
just as they were adventuring into the cave. Aramis and Porthos listened
with the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of
air.

“Oh! oh!” exclaimed one of the guards, as he came to the light, “how
pale you are!”

“Pale!” cried another; “you ought to say corpse-color.”

“I!” said the young man, endeavoring to collect his faculties.

“In the name of Heaven! what has happened?” exclaimed all the voices.

“You have not a drop of blood in your veins, my poor friend,” said one
of them, laughing.

“Messieurs, it is serious,” said another, “he is going to faint; does
any one of you happen to have any salts?” And they all laughed.

This hail of jests fell round Biscarrat’s ears like musket-balls in a
_melee_. He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations.

“What do you suppose I have seen?” asked he. “I was too hot when I
entered the grotto, and I have been struck with a chill. That is all.”

“But the dogs, the dogs; have you seen them again--did you see anything
of them--do you know anything about them?”

“I suppose they have got out some other way.”

“Messieurs,” said one of the young men, “there is in that which is going
on, in the paleness and silence of our friend, a mystery which Biscarrat
will not, or cannot reveal. Only, and this is certain, Biscarrat has
seen something in the grotto. Well, for my part, I am very curious to
see what it is, even if it is the devil! To the grotto! messieurs, to
the grotto!”

“To the grotto!” repeated all the voices. And the echo of the cavern
carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis, “To the grotto! to the
grotto!”

Biscarrat threw himself before his companions. “Messieurs! messieurs!”
 cried he, “in the name of Heaven! do not go in!”

“Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?” asked several at once.
“Come, speak, Biscarrat.”

“Decidedly, it is the devil he has seen,” repeated he who had before
advanced that hypothesis.

“Well,” said another, “if he has seen him, he need not be selfish; he
may as well let us have a look at him in turn.”

“Messieurs! messieurs! I beseech you,” urged Biscarrat.

“Nonsense! Let us pass!”

“Messieurs, I implore you not to enter!”

“Why, you went in yourself.”

Then one of the officers, who--of a riper age than the others--had till
this time remained behind, and had said nothing, advanced. “Messieurs,”
 said he, with a calmness which contrasted with the animation of the
young men, “there is in there some person, or something, that is not
the devil; but which, whatever it may be, has had sufficient power to
silence our dogs. We must discover who this some one is, or what this
something is.”

Biscarrat made a last effort to stop his friends, but it was useless. In
vain he threw himself before the rashest; in vain he clung to the rocks
to bar the passage; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave, in the
steps of the officer who had spoken last, but who had sprung in first,
sword in hand, to face the unknown danger. Biscarrat, repulsed by
his friends, unable to accompany them, without passing in the eyes
of Porthos and Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer, with painfully
attentive ear and unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the
rough side of a rock which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the
musketeers. As to the guards, they penetrated further and further,
with exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced. All at once, a
discharge of musketry, growling like thunder, exploded in the entrails
of the vault. Two or three balls were flattened against the rock on
which Biscarrat was leaning. At the same instant, cries, shrieks,
imprecations burst forth, and the little troop of gentlemen
reappeared--some pale, some bleeding--all enveloped in a cloud of
smoke, which the outer air seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern.
“Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” cried the fugitives, “you knew there was an
ambuscade in that cavern, and you did not warn us! Biscarrat, you are
the cause that four of us are murdered men! Woe be to you, Biscarrat!”

“You are the cause of my being wounded unto death,” said one of the
young men, letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm, and
spattering it into Biscarrat’s livid face. “My blood be on your head!”
 And he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man.

“But, at least, tell us who is there?” cried several furious voices.

Biscarrat remained silent. “Tell us, or die!” cried the wounded man,
raising himself upon one knee, and lifting towards his companion an
arm bearing a useless sword. Biscarrat rushed towards him, opening his
breast for the blow, but the wounded man fell back not to rise again,
uttering a groan which was his last. Biscarrat, with hair on end,
haggard eyes, and bewildered head, advanced towards the interior of
the cavern, saying, “You are right. Death to me, who have allowed my
comrades to be assassinated. I am a worthless wretch!” And throwing away
his sword, for he wished to die without defending himself, he rushed
head foremost into the cavern. The others followed him. The eleven
who remained out of sixteen imitated his example; but they did not go
further than the first. A second discharge laid five upon the icy sand;
and as it was impossible to see whence this murderous thunder issued,
the others fell back with a terror that can be better imagined than
described. But, far from flying, as the others had done, Biscarrat
remained safe and sound, seated on a fragment of rock, and waited. There
were only six gentlemen left.

“Seriously,” said one of the survivors, “is it the devil?”

“_Ma foi!_ it is much worse,” said another.

“Ask Biscarrat, he knows.”

“Where is Biscarrat?” The young men looked round them, and saw that
Biscarrat did not answer.

“He is dead!” said two or three voices.

“Oh! no!” replied another, “I saw him through the smoke, sitting quietly
on a rock. He is in the cavern; he is waiting for us.”

“He must know who are there.”

“And how should he know them?”

“He was taken prisoner by the rebels.”

“That is true. Well! let us call him, and learn from him whom we have
to deal with.” And all voices shouted, “Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” But
Biscarrat did not answer.

“Good!” said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair.
“We have no longer any need of him; here are reinforcements coming.”

In fact, a company of guards, left in the rear by their officers, whom
the ardor of the chase had carried away--from seventy-five to eighty
men--arrived in good order, led by their captain and the first
lieutenant. The five officers hastened to meet their soldiers; and, in
language the eloquence of which may be easily imagined, they related the
adventure, and asked for aid. The captain interrupted them. “Where are
your companions?” demanded he.

“Dead!”

“But there were sixteen of you!”

“Ten are dead. Biscarrat is in the cavern, and we are five.”

“Biscarrat is a prisoner?”

“Probably.”

“No, for here he is--look.” In fact, Biscarrat appeared at the opening
of the grotto.

“He is making a sign to come on,” said the officer. “Come on!”

“Come on!” cried all the troop. And they advanced to meet Biscarrat.

“Monsieur,” said the captain, addressing Biscarrat, “I am assured that
you know who the men are in that grotto, and who make such a desperate
defense. In the king’s name I command you to declare what you know.”

“Captain,” said Biscarrat, “you have no need to command me. My word has
been restored to me this very instant; and I came in the name of these
men.”

“To tell me who they are?”

“To tell you they are determined to defend themselves to the death,
unless you grant them satisfactory terms.”

“How many are there of them, then?”

“There are two,” said Biscarrat.

“There are two--and want to impose conditions upon us?”

“There are two, and they have already killed ten of our men.”

“What sort of people are they--giants?”

“Worse than that. Do you remember the history of the Bastion
Saint-Gervais, captain?”

“Yes; where four musketeers held out against an army.”

“Well, these are two of those same musketeers.”

“And their names?”

“At that period they were called Porthos and Aramis. Now they are styled
M. d’Herblay and M. du Vallon.”

“And what interest have they in all this?”

“It is they who were holding Bell-Isle for M. Fouquet.”

A murmur ran through the ranks of the soldiers on hearing the two words
“Porthos and Aramis.” “The musketeers! the musketeers!” repeated they.
And among all these brave men, the idea that they were going to have a
struggle against two of the oldest glories of the French army, made a
shiver, half enthusiasm, two-thirds terror, run through them. In fact,
those four names--D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis--were venerated
among all who wore a sword; as, in antiquity, the names of Hercules,
Theseus, Castor, and Pollux were venerated.

“Two men--and they have killed ten in two discharges! It is impossible,
Monsieur Biscarrat!”

“Eh! captain,” replied the latter, “I do not tell you that they have
not with them two or three men, as the musketeers of the Bastion
Saint-Gervais had two or three lackeys; but, believe me, captain, I
have seen these men, I have been taken prisoner by them--I know they
themselves alone are all-sufficient to destroy an army.”

“That we shall see,” said the captain, “and that in a moment, too.
Gentlemen, attention!”

At this reply, no one stirred, and all prepared to obey. Biscarrat alone
risked a last attempt.

“Monsieur,” said he, in a low voice, “be persuaded by me; let us pass
on our way. Those two men, those two lions you are going to attack, will
defend themselves to the death. They have already killed ten of our men;
they will kill double the number, and end by killing themselves rather
than surrender. What shall we gain by fighting them?”

“We shall gain the consciousness, monsieur, of not having allowed eighty
of the king’s guards to retire before two rebels. If I listened to
your advice, monsieur, I should be a dishonored man; and by dishonoring
myself I should dishonor the army. Forward, my men!”

And he marched first as far as the opening of the grotto. There he
halted. The object of this halt was to give Biscarrat and his companions
time to describe to him the interior of the grotto. Then, when he
believed he had a sufficient acquaintance with the place, he divided his
company into three bodies, which were to enter successively, keeping up
a sustained fire in all directions. No doubt, in this attack they would
lose five more, perhaps ten; but, certainly, they must end by taking the
rebels, since there was no issue; and, at any rate, two men could not
kill eighty.

“Captain,” said Biscarrat, “I beg to be allowed to march at the head of
the first platoon.”

“So be it,” replied the captain; “you have all the honor. I make you a
present of it.”

“Thanks!” replied the young man, with all the firmness of his race.

“Take your sword, then.”

“I shall go as I am, captain,” said Biscarrat, “for I do not go to kill,
I go to be killed.”

And placing himself at the head of the first platoon, with head
uncovered and arms crossed,--“March, gentlemen,” said he.



Chapter XLIX. An Homeric Song.

It is time to pass to the other camp, and to describe at once the
combatants and the field of battle. Aramis and Porthos had gone to the
grotto of Locmaria with the expectation of finding there their canoe
ready armed, as well as the three Bretons, their assistants; and they
at first hoped to make the bark pass through the little issue of the
cavern, concealing in that fashion both their labors and their flight.
The arrival of the fox and dogs obliged them to remain concealed. The
grotto extended the space of about a hundred _toises_, to that little
slope dominating a creek. Formerly a temple of the Celtic divinities,
when Belle-Isle was still called Kalonese, this grotto had beheld more
than one human sacrifice accomplished in its mystic depths. The first
entrance to the cavern was by a moderate descent, above which distorted
rocks formed a weird arcade; the interior, very uneven and dangerous
from the inequalities of the vault, was subdivided into several
compartments, which communicated with each other by means of rough and
jagged steps, fixed right and left, in uncouth natural pillars. At the
third compartment the vault was so low, the passage so narrow, that the
bark would scarcely have passed without touching the side; nevertheless,
in moments of despair, wood softens and stone grows flexible beneath the
human will. Such was the thought of Aramis, when, after having fought
the fight, he decided upon flight--a flight most dangerous, since all
the assailants were not dead; and that, admitting the possibility of
putting the bark to sea, they would have to fly in open day, before the
conquered, so interested on recognizing their small number, in pursuing
their conquerors. When the two discharges had killed ten men, Aramis,
familiar with the windings of the cavern, went to reconnoiter them one
by one, and counted them, for the smoke prevented seeing outside; and
he immediately commanded that the canoe should be rolled as far as the
great stone, the closure of the liberating issue. Porthos collected all
his strength, took the canoe in his arms, and raised it up, whilst the
Bretons made it run rapidly along the rollers. They had descended into
the third compartment; they had arrived at the stone which walled the
outlet. Porthos seized this gigantic stone at its base, applied his
robust shoulder, and gave a heave which made the wall crack. A cloud of
dust fell from the vault, with the ashes of ten thousand generations of
sea birds, whose nests stuck like cement to the rock. At the third shock
the stone gave way, and oscillated for a minute. Porthos, placing his
back against the neighboring rock, made an arch with his foot, which
drove the block out of the calcareous masses which served for hinges and
cramps. The stone fell, and daylight was visible, brilliant, radiant,
flooding the cavern through the opening, and the blue sea appeared to
the delighted Bretons. They began to lift the bark over the barricade.
Twenty more _toises_, and it would glide into the ocean. It was during
this time that the company arrived, was drawn up by the captain, and
disposed for either an escalade or an assault. Aramis watched
over everything, to favor the labors of his friends. He saw the
reinforcements, counted the men, and convinced himself at a single
glance of the insurmountable peril to which fresh combat would expose
them. To escape by sea, at the moment the cavern was about to be
invaded, was impossible. In fact, the daylight which had just been
admitted to the last compartments had exposed to the soldiers the bark
being rolled towards the sea, the two rebels within musket-shot; and
one of their discharges would riddle the boat if it did not kill the
navigators. Besides, allowing everything,--if the bark escaped with the
men on board of it, how could the alarm be suppressed--how could notice
to the royal lighters be prevented? What could hinder the poor canoe,
followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the
end of the day? Aramis, digging his hands into his gray hair with rage,
invoked the assistance of God and the assistance of the demons. Calling
to Porthos, who was doing more work than all the rollers--whether of
flesh or wood--“My friend,” said he, “our adversaries have just received
a reinforcement.”

“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, quietly, “what is to be done, then?”

“To recommence the combat,” said Aramis, “is hazardous.”

“Yes,” said Porthos, “for it is difficult to suppose that out of two,
one should not be killed; and certainly, if one of us was killed, the
other would get himself killed also.” Porthos spoke these words with
that heroic nature which, with him, grew grander with necessity.

Aramis felt it like a spur to his heart. “We shall neither of us be
killed if you do what I tell you, friend Porthos.”

“Tell me what?”

“These people are coming down into the grotto.”

“Yes.”

“We could kill about fifteen of them, but no more.”

“How many are there in all?” asked Porthos.

“They have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men.”

“Seventy-five and five, eighty. Ah!” sighed Porthos.

“If they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls.”

“Certainly they will.”

“Without reckoning,” added Aramis, “that the detonation might occasion a
collapse of the cavern.”

“Ay,” said Porthos, “a piece of falling rock just now grazed my
shoulder.”

“You see, then?”

“Oh! it is nothing.”

“We must determine upon something quickly. Our Bretons are going to
continue to roll the canoe towards the sea.”

“Very well.”

“We two will keep the powder, the balls, and the muskets here.”

“But only two, my dear Aramis--we shall never fire three shots
together,” said Porthos, innocently, “the defense by musketry is a bad
one.”

“Find a better, then.”

“I have found one,” said the giant, eagerly; “I will place myself
in ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar, and invisible,
unattackable, if they come in floods, I can let my bar fall upon their
skulls, thirty times in a minute. _Hein!_ what do you think of the
project? You smile!”

“Excellent, dear friend, perfect! I approve it greatly; only you will
frighten them, and half of them will remain outside to take us by
famine. What we want, my good friend, is the entire destruction of the
troop. A single survivor encompasses our ruin.”

“You are right, my friend, but how can we attract them, pray?”

“By not stirring, my good Porthos.”

“Well! we won’t stir, then; but when they are all together--”

“Then leave it to me, I have an idea.”

“If it is so, and your idea proves a good one--and your idea is most
likely to be good--I am satisfied.”

“To your ambuscade, Porthos, and count how many enter.”

“But you, what will you do?”

“Don’t trouble yourself about me; I have a task to perform.”

“I think I hear shouts.”

“It is they! To your post. Keep within reach of my voice and hand.”

Porthos took refuge in the second compartment, which was in darkness,
absolutely black. Aramis glided into the third; the giant held in his
hand an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight. Porthos handled this
lever, which had been used in rolling the bark, with marvelous facility.
During this time, the Bretons had pushed the bark to the beach. In the
further and lighter compartment, Aramis, stooping and concealed, was
busy with some mysterious maneuver. A command was given in a loud voice.
It was the last order of the captain commandant. Twenty-five men jumped
from the upper rocks into the first compartment of the grotto, and
having taken their ground, began to fire. The echoes shrieked and
barked, the hissing balls seemed actually to rarefy the air, and then
opaque smoke filled the vault.

“To the left! to the left!” cried Biscarrat, who, in his first assault,
had seen the passage to the second chamber, and who, animated by the
smell of powder, wished to guide his soldiers in that direction. The
troop, accordingly, precipitated themselves to the left--the passage
gradually growing narrower. Biscarrat, with his hands stretched forward,
devoted to death, marched in advance of the muskets. “Come on! come on!”
 exclaimed he, “I see daylight!”

“Strike, Porthos!” cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis.

Porthos breathed a heavy sigh--but he obeyed. The iron bar fell full and
direct upon the head of Biscarrat, who was dead before he had ended his
cry. Then the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds, and
made ten corpses. The soldiers could see nothing; they heard sighs and
groans; they stumbled over dead bodies, but as they had no conception
of the cause of all this, they came forward jostling each other. The
implacable bar, still falling, annihilated the first platoon, without
a single sound to warn the second, which was quietly advancing; only,
commanded by the captain, the men had stripped a fir, growing on the
shore, and, with its resinous branches twisted together, the captain had
made a flambeau. On arriving at the compartment where Porthos, like the
exterminating angel, had destroyed all he touched, the first rank drew
back in terror. No firing had replied to that of the guards, and yet
their way was stopped by a heap of dead bodies--they literally walked in
blood. Porthos was still behind his pillar. The captain, illumining with
trembling pine-torch this frightful carnage, of which he in vain
sought the cause, drew back towards the pillar behind which Porthos was
concealed. Then a gigantic hand issued from the shade, and fastened
on the throat of the captain, who uttered a stifle rattle; his
stretched-out arms beating the air, the torch fell and was extinguished
in blood. A second after, the corpse of the captain dropped close to
the extinguished torch, and added another body to the heap of dead which
blocked up the passage. All this was effected as mysteriously as though
by magic. At hearing the rattling in the throat of the captain, the
soldiers who accompanied him had turned round, caught a glimpse of his
extended arms, his eyes starting from their sockets, and then the torch
fell and they were left in darkness. From an unreflective, instinctive,
mechanical feeling, the lieutenant cried:

“Fire!”

Immediately a volley of musketry flamed, thundered, roared in the
cavern, bringing down enormous fragments from the vaults. The cavern was
lighted for an instant by this discharge, and then immediately returned
to pitchy darkness rendered thicker by the smoke. To this succeeded a
profound silence, broken only by the steps of the third brigade, now
entering the cavern.



Chapter L: The Death of a Titan.

At the moment when Porthos, more accustomed to the darkness than these
men, coming from open daylight, was looking round him to see if through
this artificial midnight Aramis were not making him some signal, he felt
his arm gently touched, and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear,
“Come.”

“Oh!” said Porthos.

“Hush!” said Aramis, if possible, yet more softly.

And amidst the noise of the third brigade, which continued to advance,
the imprecations of the guards still left alive, the muffled groans of
the dying, Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of
the cavern. Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment, and
showed him, in a hollow of the rocky wall, a barrel of powder weighing
from seventy to eighty pounds, to which he had just attached a fuse. “My
friend,” said he to Porthos, “you will take this barrel, the match of
which I am going to set fire to, and throw it amidst our enemies; can
you do so?”

“_Parbleu!_” replied Porthos; and he lifted the barrel with one hand.
“Light it!”

“Stop,” said Aramis, “till they are all massed together, and then, my
Jupiter, hurl your thunderbolt among them.”

“Light it,” repeated Porthos.

“On my part,” continued Aramis, “I will join our Bretons, and help them
to get the canoe to the sea. I will wait for you on the shore; launch it
strongly, and hasten to us.”

“Light it,” said Porthos, a third time.

“But do you understand me?”

“_Parbleu!_” said Porthos again, with laughter that he did not even
attempt to restrain, “when a thing is explained to me I understand it;
begone, and give me the light.”

Aramis gave the burning match to Porthos, who held out his arm to him,
his hands being engaged. Aramis pressed the arm of Porthos with both his
hands, and fell back to the outlet of the cavern where the three rowers
awaited him.

Porthos, left alone, applied the spark bravely to the match. The
spark--a feeble spark, first principle of conflagration--shone in the
darkness like a glow-worm, then was deadened against the match which it
set fire to, Porthos enlivening the flame with his breath. The smoke
was a little dispersed, and by the light of the sparkling match objects
might, for two seconds, be distinguished. It was a brief but splendid
spectacle, that of this giant, pale, bloody, his countenance lighted by
the fire of the match burning in surrounding darkness! The soldiers saw
him, they saw the barrel he held in his hand--they at once understood
what was going to happen. Then, these men, already choked with horror at
the sight of what had been accomplished, filled with terror at thought
of what was about to be accomplished, gave out a simultaneous shriek of
agony. Some endeavored to fly, but they encountered the third brigade,
which barred their passage; others mechanically took aim and attempted
to fire their discharged muskets; others fell instinctively upon their
knees. Two or three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his
liberty if he would spare their lives. The lieutenant of the third
brigade commanded his men to fire; but the guards had before them their
terrified companions, who served as a living rampart for Porthos. We
have said that the light produced by the spark and the match did not
last more than two seconds; but during these two seconds this is what
it illumined: in the first place, the giant, enlarged in the darkness;
then, at ten paces off, a heap of bleeding bodies, crushed, mutilated,
in the midst of which some still heaved in the last agony, lifting the
mass as a last respiration inflating the sides of some old monster dying
in the night. Every breath of Porthos, thus vivifying the match, sent
towards this heap of bodies a phosphorescent aura, mingled with streaks
of purple. In addition to this principal group scattered about the
grotto, as the chances of death or surprise had stretched them, isolated
bodies seemed to be making ghastly exhibitions of their gaping wounds.
Above ground, bedded in pools of blood, rose, heavy and sparkling, the
short, thick pillars of the cavern, of which the strongly marked shades
threw out the luminous particles. And all this was seen by the tremulous
light of a match attached to a barrel of powder, that is to say, a torch
which, whilst throwing a light on the dead past, showed death to come.

As I have said, this spectacle did not last above two seconds. During
this short space of time an officer of the third brigade got together
eight men armed with muskets, and, through an opening, ordered them to
fire upon Porthos. But they who received the order to fire trembled so
that three guards fell by the discharge, and the five remaining balls
hissed on to splinter the vault, plow the ground, or indent the pillars
of the cavern.

A burst of laughter replied to this volley; then the arm of the giant
swung round; then was seen whirling through the air, like a falling
star, the train of fire. The barrel, hurled a distance of thirty
feet, cleared the barricade of dead bodies, and fell amidst a group of
shrieking soldiers, who threw themselves on their faces. The officer had
followed the brilliant train in the air; he endeavored to precipitate
himself upon the barrel and tear out the match before it reached the
powder it contained. Useless! The air had made the flame attached to the
conductor more active; the match, which at rest might have burnt five
minutes, was consumed in thirty seconds, and the infernal work exploded.
Furious vortices of sulphur and nitre, devouring shoals of fire which
caught every object, the terrible thunder of the explosion, this is what
the second which followed disclosed in that cavern of horrors. The rocks
split like planks of deal beneath the axe. A jet of fire, smoke, and
_debris_ sprang from the middle of the grotto, enlarging as it mounted.
The large walls of silex tottered and fell upon the sand, and the sand
itself, an instrument of pain when launched from its hard bed, riddled
the faces with its myriad cutting atoms. Shrieks, imprecations, human
life, dead bodies--all were engulfed in one terrific crash.

The three first compartments became one sepulchral sink into which fell
grimly back, in the order of their weight, every vegetable, mineral,
or human fragment. Then the lighter sand and ash came down in turn,
stretching like a winding sheet and smoking over the dismal scene. And
now, in this burning tomb, this subterranean volcano, seek the king’s
guards with their blue coats laced with silver. Seek the officers,
brilliant in gold, seek for the arms upon which they depended for their
defense. One single man has made of all of those things a chaos more
confused, more shapeless, more terrible than the chaos which existed
before the creation of the world. There remained nothing of the three
compartments--nothing by which God could have recognized His handiwork.
As for Porthos, after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst his
enemies, he had fled, as Aramis had directed him to do, and had gained
the last compartment, into which air, light, and sunshine penetrated
through the opening. Scarcely had he turned the angle which separated
the third compartment from the fourth when he perceived at a hundred
paces from him the bark dancing on the waves. There were his friends,
there liberty, there life and victory. Six more of his formidable
strides, and he would be out of the vault; out of the vault! a dozen of
his vigorous leaps and he would reach the canoe. Suddenly he felt his
knees give way; his knees seemed powerless, his legs to yield beneath
him.

“Oh! oh!” murmured he, “there is my weakness seizing me again! I can
walk no further! What is this?”

Aramis perceived him through the opening, and unable to conceive what
could induce him to stop thus--“Come on, Porthos! come on,” he cried;
“come quickly!”

“Oh!” replied the giant, making an effort that contorted every muscle of
his body--“oh! but I cannot.” While saying these words, he fell upon
his knees, but with his mighty hands he clung to the rocks, and raised
himself up again.

“Quick! quick!” repeated Aramis, bending forward towards the shore, as
if to draw Porthos towards him with his arms.

“Here I am,” stammered Porthos, collecting all his strength to make one
step more.

“In the name of Heaven! Porthos, make haste! the barrel will blow up!”

“Make haste, monseigneur!” shouted the Bretons to Porthos, who was
floundering as in a dream.

But there was no time; the explosion thundered, earth gaped, the smoke
which hurled through the clefts obscured the sky; the sea flowed back as
though driven by the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if
from the jaws of some gigantic fiery chimera; the reflux took the
bark out twenty _toises_; the solid rocks cracked to their base, and
separated like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge; a portion
of the vault was carried up towards heaven, as if it had been built of
cardboard; the green and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of
liquefactions clashed and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome
of smoke; then oscillated, declined, and fell successively the mighty
monoliths of rock which the violence of the explosion had not been able
to uproot from the bed of ages; they bowed to each other like grave and
stiff old men, then prostrating themselves, lay down forever in their
dusty tomb.

This frightful shock seemed to restore Porthos the strength that he had
lost; he arose, a giant among granite giants. But at the moment he was
flying between the double hedge of granite phantoms, these latter, which
were no longer supported by the corresponding links, began to roll and
totter round our Titan, who looked as if precipitated from heaven amidst
rocks which he had just been launching. Porthos felt the very earth
beneath his feet becoming jelly-tremulous. He stretched both hands to
repulse the falling rocks. A gigantic block was held back by each of his
extended arms. He bent his head, and a third granite mass sank between
his shoulders. For an instant the power of Porthos seemed about to fail
him, but this new Hercules united all his force, and the two walls of
the prison in which he was buried fell back slowly and gave him place.
For an instant he appeared, in this frame of granite, like the angel
of chaos, but in pushing back the lateral rocks, he lost his point of
support, for the monolith which weighed upon his shoulders, and the
boulder, pressing upon him with all its weight, brought the giant down
upon his knees. The lateral rocks, for an instant pushed back, drew
together again, and added their weight to the ponderous mass which would
have been sufficient to crush ten men. The hero fell without a groan--he
fell while answering Aramis with words of encouragement and hope, for,
thanks to the powerful arch of his hands, for an instant he believed
that, like Enceladus, he would succeed in shaking off the triple load.
But by degrees Aramis beheld the block sink; the hands, strung for an
instant, the arms stiffened for a last effort, gave way, the extended
shoulders sank, wounded and torn, and the rocks continued to gradually
collapse.

“Porthos! Porthos!” cried Aramis, tearing his hair. “Porthos! where are
you? Speak!”

“Here, here,” murmured Porthos, with a voice growing evidently weaker,
“patience! patience!”

Scarcely had he pronounced these words, when the impulse of the fall
augmented the weight; the enormous rock sank down, pressed by those
others which sank in from the sides, and, as it were, swallowed up
Porthos in a sepulcher of badly jointed stones. On hearing the dying
voice of his friend, Aramis had sprung to land. Two of the Bretons
followed him, with each a lever in his hand--one being sufficient to
take care of the bark. The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided
them amidst the ruins. Aramis, animated, active and young as at twenty,
sprang towards the triple mass, and with his hands, delicate as those of
a woman, raised by a miracle of strength the corner-stone of this great
granite grave. Then he caught a glimpse, through the darkness of that
charnel-house, of the still brilliant eye of his friend, to whom the
momentary lifting of the mass restored a momentary respiration. The
two men came rushing up, grasped their iron levers, united their triple
strength, not merely to raise it, but sustain it. All was useless. They
gave way with cries of grief, and the rough voice of Porthos, seeing
them exhaust themselves in a useless struggle, murmured in an almost
cheerful tone those supreme words which came to his lips with the last
respiration, “Too heavy!”

After which his eyes darkened and closed, his face grew ashy pale, the
hands whitened, and the colossus sank quite down, breathing his last
sigh. With him sank the rock, which, even in his dying agony he had
still held up. The three men dropped the levers, which rolled upon the
tumulary stone. Then, breathless, pale, his brow covered with sweat,
Aramis listened, his breast oppressed, his heart ready to break.

Nothing more. The giant slept the eternal sleep, in the sepulcher which
God had built about him to his measure.



Chapter LI. Porthos’s Epitaph.

Aramis, silent and sad as ice, trembling like a timid child, arose
shivering from the stone. A Christian does not walk on tombs. But,
though capable of standing, he was not capable of walking. It might
be said that something of dead Porthos had just died within him. His
Bretons surrounded him; Aramis yielded to their kind exertions, and the
three sailors, lifting him up, carried him to the canoe. Then, having
laid him down upon the bench near the rudder, they took to their oars,
preferring this to hoisting sail, which might betray them.

On all that leveled surface of the ancient grotto of Locmaria, one
single hillock attracted their eyes. Aramis never removed his from it;
and, at a distance out in the sea, in proportion as the shore receded,
that menacing proud mass of rock seemed to draw itself up, as formerly
Porthos used to draw himself up, raising a smiling, yet invincible head
towards heaven, like that of his dear old honest valiant friend, the
strongest of the four, yet the first dead. Strange destiny of these men
of brass! The most simple of heart allied to the most crafty; strength
of body guided by subtlety of mind; and in the decisive moment, when
vigor alone could save mind and body, a stone, a rock, a vile material
weight, triumphed over manly strength, and falling upon the body, drove
out the mind.

Worthy Porthos! born to help other men, always ready to sacrifice
himself for the safety of the weak, as if God had only given him
strength for that purpose; when dying he only thought he was carrying
out the conditions of his compact with Aramis, a compact, however, which
Aramis alone had drawn up, and which Porthos had only known to suffer
by its terrible solidarity. Noble Porthos! of what good now are thy
chateaux overflowing with sumptuous furniture, forests overflowing with
game, lakes overflowing with fish, cellars overflowing with wealth! Of
what service to thee now thy lackeys in brilliant liveries, and in the
midst of them Mousqueton, proud of the power delegated by thee! Oh,
noble Porthos! careful heaper-up of treasure, was it worth while to
labor to sweeten and gild life, to come upon a desert shore, surrounded
by the cries of seagulls, and lay thyself, with broken bones, beneath
a torpid stone? Was it worth while, in short, noble Porthos, to heap so
much gold, and not have even the distich of a poor poet engraven upon
thy monument? Valiant Porthos! he still, without doubt, sleeps, lost,
forgotten, beneath the rock the shepherds of the heath take for the
gigantic abode of a _dolmen_. And so many twining branches, so many
mosses, bent by the bitter wind of ocean, so many lichens solder thy
sepulcher to earth, that no passers-by will imagine such a block of
granite could ever have been supported by the shoulders of one man.

Aramis, still pale, still icy-cold, his heart upon his lips, looked,
even till, with the last ray of daylight, the shore faded on the
horizon. Not a word escaped him, not a sigh rose from his deep breast.
The superstitious Bretons looked upon him, trembling. Such silence was
not that of a man, it was the silence of a statue. In the meantime, with
the first gray lines that lighted up the heavens, the canoe hoisted its
little sail, which, swelling with the kisses of the breeze, and carrying
them rapidly from the coast, made bravest way towards Spain, across the
dreaded Gulf of Gascony, so rife with storms. But scarcely half an hour
after the sail had been hoisted, the rowers became inactive, reclining
on their benches, and, making an eye-shade with their hands, pointed out
to each other a white spot which appeared on the horizon as motionless
as a gull rocked by the viewless respiration of the waves. But that
which might have appeared motionless to ordinary eyes was moving at a
quick rate to the experienced eye of the sailor; that which appeared
stationary upon the ocean was cutting a rapid way through it. For some
time, seeing the profound torpor in which their master was plunged,
they did not dare to rouse him, and satisfied themselves with exchanging
their conjectures in whispers. Aramis, in fact, so vigilant, so
active--Aramis, whose eye, like that of the lynx, watched without
ceasing, and saw better by night than by day--Aramis seemed to sleep
in this despair of soul. An hour passed thus, during which daylight
gradually disappeared, but during which also the sail in view gained so
swiftly on the bark, that Goenne, one of the three sailors, ventured to
say aloud:

“Monseigneur, we are being chased!”

Aramis made no reply; the ship still gained upon them. Then, of their
own accord, two of the sailors, by the direction of the patron Yves,
lowered the sail, in order that that single point upon the surface of
the waters should cease to be a guide to the eye of the enemy pursuing
them. On the part of the ship in sight, on the contrary, two more small
sails were run up at the extremities of the masts. Unfortunately, it was
the time of the finest and longest days of the year, and the moon, in
all her brilliancy, succeeded inauspicious daylight. The _balancelle_,
which was pursuing the little bark before the wind, had then still half
an hour of twilight, and a whole night almost as light as day.

“Monseigneur! monseigneur! we are lost!” said the captain. “Look! they
see us plainly, though we have lowered sail.”

“That is not to be wondered at,” murmured one of the sailors, “since
they say that, by the aid of the devil, the Paris-folk have fabricated
instruments with which they see as well at a distance as near, by night
as well as by day.”

Aramis took a telescope from the bottom of the boat, focussed it
silently, and passing it to the sailor, “Here,” said he, “look!” The
sailor hesitated.

“Don’t be alarmed,” said the bishop, “there is no sin in it; and if
there is any sin, I will take it on myself.”

The sailor lifted the glass to his eye, and uttered a cry. He believed
that the vessel, which appeared to be distant about cannon-shot, had
at a single bound cleared the whole distance. But, on withdrawing
the instrument from his eye, he saw that, except the way which the
_balancelle_ had been able to make during that brief instant, it was
still at the same distance.

“So,” murmured the sailor, “they can see us as we see them.”

“They see us,” said Aramis, and sank again into impassibility.

“What!--they see us!” said Yves. “Impossible!”

“Well, captain, look yourself,” said the sailor. And he passed him the
glass.

“Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?”
 asked Yves.

Aramis shrugged his shoulders.

The skipper lifted the glass to his eye. “Oh! monseigneur,” said he, “it
is a miracle--there they are; it seems as if I were going to touch them.
Twenty-five men at least! Ah! I see the captain forward. He holds a
glass like this, and is looking at us. Ah! he turns round, and gives
an order; they are rolling a piece of cannon forward--they are loading
it--pointing it. _Misericorde!_ they are firing at us!”

And by a mechanical movement, the skipper put aside the telescope, and
the pursuing ship, relegated to the horizon, appeared again in its true
aspect. The vessel was still at the distance of nearly a league, but the
maneuver sighted thus was not less real. A light cloud of smoke appeared
beneath the sails, more blue than they, and spreading like a flower
opening; then, at about a mile from the little canoe, they saw the ball
take the crown off two or three waves, dig a white furrow in the sea,
and disappear at the end of it, as inoffensive as the stone with which,
in play, a boy makes ducks and drakes. It was at once a menace and a
warning.

“What is to be done?” asked the patron.

“They will sink us!” said Goenne, “give us absolution, monseigneur!” And
the sailors fell on their knees before him.

“You forget that they can see you,” said he.

“That is true!” said the sailors, ashamed of their weakness. “Give us
your orders, monseigneur, we are prepared to die for you.”

“Let us wait,” said Aramis.

“How--let us wait?”

“Yes; do you not see, as you just now said, that if we endeavor to fly,
they will sink us?”

“But, perhaps,” the patron ventured to say, “perhaps under cover of
night, we could escape them.”

“Oh!” said Aramis, “they have, no doubt, Greek fire with which to
lighten their own course and ours likewise.”

At the same moment, as if the vessel was responsive to the appeal of
Aramis, a second cloud of smoke mounted slowly to the heavens, and from
the bosom of that cloud sparkled an arrow of flame, which described a
parabola like a rainbow, and fell into the sea, where it continued to
burn, illuminating a space of a quarter of a league in diameter.

The Bretons looked at each other in terror. “You see plainly,” said
Aramis, “it will be better to wait for them.”

The oars dropped from the hands of the sailors, and the bark, ceasing
to make way, rocked motionless upon the summits of the waves. Night came
on, but still the ship drew nearer. It might be imagined it redoubled
its speed with darkness. From time to time, as a vulture rears its head
out of its nest, the formidable Greek fire darted from its sides, and
cast its flame upon the ocean like an incandescent snowfall. At last
it came within musket-shot. All the men were on deck, arms in hand; the
cannoniers were at their guns, the matches burning. It might be thought
they were about to board a frigate and to fight a crew superior in
number to their own, not to attempt the capture of a canoe manned by
four people.

“Surrender!” cried the commander of the _balancelle_, with the aid of
his speaking-trumpet.

The sailors looked at Aramis. Aramis made a sign with his head. Yves
waved a white cloth at the end of a gaff. This was like striking their
flag. The pursuer came on like a race-horse. It launched a fresh Greek
fire, which fell within twenty paces of the little canoe, and threw a
light upon them as white as sunshine.

“At the first sign of resistance,” cried the commander of the
_balancelle_, “fire!” The soldiers brought their muskets to the present.

“Did we not say we surrendered?” said Yves.

“Alive, alive, captain!” cried one excited soldier, “they must be taken
alive.”

“Well, yes--living,” said the captain. Then turning towards the Bretons,
“Your lives are safe, my friends!” cried he, “all but the Chevalier
d’Herblay.”

Aramis stared imperceptibly. For an instant his eye was fixed upon the
depths of the ocean, illumined by the last flashes of the Greek fire,
which ran along the sides of the waves, played on the crests like
plumes, and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they
covered.

“Do you hear, monseigneur?” said the sailors.

“Yes.”

“What are your orders?”

“Accept!”

“But you, monseigneur?”

Aramis leaned still more forward, and dipped the ends of his long white
fingers in the green limpid waters of the sea, to which he turned with
smiles as to a friend.

“Accept!” repeated he.

“We accept,” repeated the sailors; “but what security have we?”

“The word of a gentleman,” said the officer. “By my rank and by my name
I swear that all except M. le Chevalier d’Herblay shall have their lives
spared. I am lieutenant of the king’s frigate the ‘Pomona,’ and my name
is Louis Constant de Pressigny.”

With a rapid gesture, Aramis--already bent over the side of the bark
towards the sea--drew himself up, and with a flashing eye, and a smile
upon his lips, “Throw out the ladder, messieurs,” said he, as if the
command had belonged to him. He was obeyed. When Aramis, seizing the
rope ladder, walked straight up to the commander, with a firm step,
looked at him earnestly, made a sign to him with his hand, a mysterious
and unknown sign at sight of which the officer turned pale, trembled,
and bowed his head, the sailors were profoundly astonished. Without a
word Aramis then raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed
him the collet of a ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand.
And while making this sign Aramis, draped in cold and haughty majesty,
had the air of an emperor giving his hand to be kissed. The commandant,
who for a moment had raised his head, bowed a second time with marks of
the most profound respect. Then stretching his hand out, in his turn,
towards the poop, that is to say, towards his own cabin, he drew back to
allow Aramis to go first. The three Bretons, who had come on board after
their bishop, looked at each other, stupefied. The crew were awed to
silence. Five minutes after, the commander called the second lieutenant,
who returned immediately, ordering the head to be put towards Corunna.
Whilst this order was being executed, Aramis reappeared upon the deck,
and took a seat near the _bastingage_. Night had fallen; the moon had
not yet risen, yet Aramis looked incessantly towards Belle-Isle. Yves
then approached the captain, who had returned to take his post in the
stern, and said, in a low and humble voice, “What course are we to
follow, captain?”

“We take what course monseigneur pleases,” replied the officer.

Aramis passed the night leaning upon the _bastingage_. Yves, on
approaching him next morning, remarked that “the night must have been
a very damp one, for the wood on which the bishop’s head had rested was
soaked with dew.” Who knows?--that dew was, it may be, the first tears
that had ever fallen from the eyes of Aramis!

What epitaph would have been worth that, good Porthos?



Chapter LII. M. de Gesvres’s Round.

D’Artagnan was little used to resistance like that he had just
experienced. He returned, profoundly irritated, to Nantes. Irritation,
with this vigorous man, usually vented itself in impetuous attack, which
few people, hitherto, were they king, were they giants, had been able to
resist. Trembling with rage, he went straight to the castle, and asked
an audience with the king. It might be about seven o’clock in the
morning, and, since his arrival at Nantes, the king had been an early
riser. But on arriving at the corridor with which we are acquainted,
D’Artagnan found M. de Gesvres, who stopped him politely, telling him
not to speak too loud and disturb the king. “Is the king asleep?” said
D’Artagnan. “Well, I will let him sleep. But about what o’clock do you
suppose he will rise?”

“Oh! in about two hours; his majesty has been up all night.”

D’Artagnan took his hat again, bowed to M. de Gesvres, and returned to
his own apartments. He came back at half-past nine, and was told that
the king was at breakfast. “That will just suit me,” said D’Artagnan. “I
will talk to the king while he is eating.”

M. de Brienne reminded D’Artagnan that the king would not see any one at
meal-time.

“But,” said D’Artagnan, looking askant at Brienne, “you do not know,
perhaps, monsieur, that I have the privilege of _entree_ anywhere--and
at any hour.”

Brienne took the captain’s hand kindly, and said, “Not at Nantes, dear
Monsieur d’Artagnan. The king, in this journey, has changed everything.”

D’Artagnan, a little softened, asked about what o’clock the king would
have finished his breakfast.

“We don’t know.”

“Eh?--don’t know! What does that mean? You don’t know how much time the
king devotes to eating? It is generally an hour; and, if we admit that
the air of the Loire gives an additional appetite, we will extend it to
an hour and a half; that is enough, I think. I will wait where I am.”

“Oh! dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, the order of the day is not to allow any
person to remain in this corridor; I am on guard for that particular
purpose.”

D’Artagnan felt his anger mounting to his brain a second time. He
went out quickly, for fear of complicating the affair by a display of
premature ill-humor. As soon as he was out he began to reflect. “The
king,” said he, “will not receive me, that is evident. The young man is
angry; he is afraid, beforehand, of the words that I may speak to him.
Yes; but in the meantime Belle-Isle is besieged, and my two friends by
now probably taken or killed. Poor Porthos! As to Master Aramis, he is
always full of resources, and I am easy on his account. But, no, no;
Porthos is not yet an invalid, nor is Aramis in his dotage. The one
with his arm, the other with his imagination, will find work for his
majesty’s soldiers. Who knows if these brave men may not get up for
the edification of his most Christian majesty a little bastion of
Saint-Gervais! I don’t despair of it. They have cannon and a garrison.
And yet,” continued D’Artagnan, “I don’t know whether it would not
be better to stop the combat. For myself alone I will not put up with
either surly looks or insults from the king; but for my friends I must
put up with everything. Shall I go to M. Colbert? Now, there is a man
I must acquire the habit of terrifying. I will go to M. Colbert.” And
D’Artagnan set forward bravely to find M. Colbert, but was informed that
he was working with the king, at the castle of Nantes. “Good!” cried he,
“the times have come again in which I measured my steps from De Treville
to the cardinal, from the cardinal to the queen, from the queen to
Louis XIII. Truly is it said that men, in growing old, become children
again!--To the castle, then!” He returned thither. M. de Lyonne was
coming out. He gave D’Artagnan both hands, but told him that the king
had been busy all the preceding evening and all night, and that orders
had been given that no one should be admitted. “Not even the captain who
takes the order?” cried D’Artagnan. “I think that is rather too strong.”

“Not even he,” said M. de Lyonne.

“Since that is the case,” replied D’Artagnan, wounded to the heart;
“since the captain of the musketeers, who has always entered the
king’s chamber, is no longer allowed to enter it, his cabinet, or
his _salle-a-manger_, either the king is dead, or his captain is in
disgrace. Do me the favor, then, M. de Lyonne, who are in favor, to
return and tell the king, plainly, I send him my resignation.”

“D’Artagnan, beware of what you are doing!”

“For friendship’s sake, go!” and he pushed him gently towards the
cabinet.

“Well, I will go,” said Lyonne.

D’Artagnan waited, walking about the corridor in no enviable mood.
Lyonne returned.

“Well, what did the king say?” exclaimed D’Artagnan.

“He simply answered, ‘’Tis well,’” replied Lyonne.

“That it was well!” said the captain, with an explosion. “That is to
say, that he accepts it? Good! Now, then, I am free! I am only a plain
citizen, M. de Lyonne. I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye!
Farewell, castle, corridor, ante-chamber! a _bourgeois_, about to
breathe at liberty, takes his farewell of you.”

And without waiting longer, the captain sprang from the terrace down the
staircase, where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville’s letter.
Five minutes after, he was at the hostelry, where, according to the
custom of all great officers who have lodgings at the castle, he had
taken what was called his city-chamber. But when he arrived there,
instead of throwing off his sword and cloak, he took his pistols, put
his money into a large leather purse, sent for his horses from the
castle-stables, and gave orders that would ensure their reaching Vannes
during the night. Everything went on according to his wishes. At eight
o’clock in the evening, he was putting his foot in the stirrup, when
M. de Gesvres appeared, at the head of twelve guards, in front of the
hostelry. D’Artagnan saw all from the corner of his eye; he could not
fail seeing thirteen men and thirteen horses. But he feigned not to
observe anything, and was about to put his horse in motion. Gesvres rode
up to him. “Monsieur d’Artagnan!” said he, aloud.

“Ah, Monsieur de Gesvres! good evening!”

“One would say you were getting on horseback.”

“More than that,--I am mounted,--as you see.”

“It is fortunate I have met with you.”

“Were you looking for me, then?”

“_Mon Dieu!_ yes.”

“On the part of the king, I will wager?”

“Yes.”

“As I, three days ago, went in search of M. Fouquet?”

“Oh!”

“Nonsense! It is of no use being over-delicate with me; that is all
labor lost. Tell me at once you are come to arrest me.”

“To arrest you?--Good heavens! no.”

“Why do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels, then?”

“I am making my round.”

“That isn’t bad! And so you pick me up in your round, eh?”

“I don’t pick you up; I meet with you, and I beg you to come with me.”

“Where?”

“To the king.”

“Good!” said D’Artagnan, with a bantering air; “the king is disengaged.”

“For Heaven’s sake, captain,” said M. de Gesvres, in a low voice to the
musketeer, “do not compromise yourself! these men hear you.”

D’Artagnan laughed aloud, and replied:

“March! People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards
and the six last.”

“But as I am not arresting you,” said M. de Gesvres, “you will march
behind, with me, if you please.”

“Well,” said D’Artagnan, “that is very polite, duke, and you are
right in being so; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your
_chambre-de-ville_, I should have been courteous to you, I assure you,
on the word of a gentleman! Now, one favor more; what does the king want
with me?”

“Oh, the king is furious!”

“Very well! the king, who has thought it worth while to be angry, may
take the trouble to grow calm again; that is all. I shan’t die of that,
I will swear.”

“No, but--”

“But--I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet.
_Mordioux!_ That is a gallant man, a worthy man! We shall live very
sociably together, I will be sworn.”

“Here we are at our place of destination,” said the duke. “Captain, for
Heaven’s sake be calm with the king!”

“Ah! ah! you are playing the brave man with me, duke!” said D’Artagnan,
throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres. “I have been told
that you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers. This
strikes me as a splendid opportunity.”

“I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it, captain.”

“And why not, pray?”

“Oh, for many reasons--in the first place, for this: if I were to
succeed you in the musketeers after having arrested you--”

“Ah! then you admit you have arrested me?”

“No, I _don’t_.”

“Say met me, then. So, you were saying _if_ you were to succeed me after
having arrested me?”

“Your musketeers, at the first exercise with ball cartridges, would fire
_my_ way, by mistake.”

“Oh, as to that I won’t say; for the fellows _do_ love me a little.”

Gesvres made D’Artagnan pass in first, and took him straight to the
cabinet where Louis was waiting for his captain of the musketeers, and
placed himself behind his colleague in the ante-chamber. The king could
be heard distinctly, speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where
Colbert might have heard, a few days before, the king speaking aloud
with M. d’Artagnan. The guards remained as a mounted picket before the
principal gate; and the report was quickly spread throughout the city
that monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order
of the king. Then these men were seen to be in motion, and as in the
good old times of Louis XIII. and M. de Treville, groups were formed,
and staircases were filled; vague murmurs, issuing from the court below,
came rolling to the upper stories, like the distant moaning of the
waves. M. de Gesvres became uneasy. He looked at his guards, who, after
being interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks,
began to shun them with a manifestation of innocence. D’Artagnan was
certainly less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres, the captain of
the guards. As soon as he entered, he seated himself on the ledge of a
window whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without
the least emotion. No step of the progressive fermentation which had
shown itself at the report of his arrest escaped him. He foresaw
the very moment the explosion would take place; and we know that his
previsions were in general correct.

“It would be very whimsical,” thought he, “if, this evening, my
praetorians should make me king of France. How I should laugh!”

But, at the height, all was stopped. Guards, musketeers, officers,
soldiers, murmurs, uneasiness, dispersed, vanished, died away; there was
an end of menace and sedition. One word had calmed the waves. The king
had desired Brienne to say, “Hush, messieurs! you disturb the king.”

D’Artagnan sighed. “All is over!” said he; “the musketeers of the
present day are not those of his majesty Louis XIII. All is over!”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan, you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king,”
 proclaimed an usher.



Chapter LIII. King Louis XIV.

The king was seated in his cabinet, with his back turned towards the
door of entrance. In front of him was a mirror, in which, while turning
over his papers, he could see at a glance those who came in. He did
not take any notice of the entrance of D’Artagnan, but spread above his
letters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets
from the importunate. D’Artagnan understood this by-play, and kept
in the background; so that at the end of a minute the king, who heard
nothing, and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye, was obliged to
cry, “Is not M. d’Artagnan there?”

“I am here, sire,” replied the musketeer, advancing.

“Well, monsieur,” said the king, fixing his pellucid eyes on D’Artagnan,
“what have you to say to me?”

“I, sire!” replied the latter, who watched the first blow of his
adversary to make a good retort; “I have nothing to say to your majesty,
unless it be that you have caused me to be arrested, and here I am.”

The king was going to reply that he had not had D’Artagnan arrested, but
any such sentence appeared too much like an excuse, and he was silent.
D’Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate silence.

“Monsieur,” at length resumed the king, “what did I charge you to go and
do at Belle-Isle? Tell me, if you please.”

The king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain.
Here D’Artagnan was fortunate; the king seemed to place the game in his
hands.

“I believe,” replied he, “that your majesty does me the honor to ask
what I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish?”

“Yes, monsieur.”

“Well! sire, I know nothing about it; it is not of me that question
should be asked, but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds,
to whom have been given innumerable orders of all kinds, whilst to me,
head of the expedition, nothing precise was said or stated in any form
whatever.”

The king was hurt: he showed it by his reply. “Monsieur,” said he,
“orders have only been given to such as were judged faithful.”

“And, therefore, I have been astonished, sire,” retorted the musketeer,
“that a captain like myself, who ranks with a marechal of France,
should have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or
majors, good to make spies of, possibly, but not at all fit to conduct
a warlike expedition. It was upon this subject I came to demand an
explanation of your majesty, when I found the door closed against me,
which, the final insult offered to a brave man, has led me to quit your
majesty’s service.”

“Monsieur,” replied the king, “you still believe that you are living in
an age when kings were, as you complain of having been, under the orders
and at the discretion of their inferiors. You seem to forget that a king
owes an account of his actions to none but God.”

“I forget nothing, sire,” said the musketeer, wounded by this lesson.
“Besides, I do not see in what an honest man, when he asks of his king
how he has ill-served him, offends him.”

“You have ill-served me, monsieur, by siding with my enemies against
me.”

“Who are your enemies, sire?”

“The men I sent you to fight.”

“Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty’s army! That is
incredible.”

“You have no power to judge of my will.”

“But I have to judge of my own friendships, sire.”

“He who serves his friends does not serve his master.”

“I so well understand this, sire, that I have respectfully offered your
majesty my resignation.”

“And I have accepted it, monsieur,” said the king. “Before being
separated from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep
my word.”

“Your majesty has kept more than your word, for your majesty has had me
arrested,” said D’Artagnan, with his cold, bantering air; “you did not
promise me that, sire.”

The king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry, and continued,
seriously, “You see, monsieur, to what grave steps your disobedience
forces me.”

“My disobedience!” cried D’Artagnan, red with anger.

“It is the mildest term that I can find,” pursued the king. “My idea was
to take and punish rebels; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels
were your friends or not?”

“But I was,” replied D’Artagnan. “It was a cruelty on your majesty’s
part to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets.”

“It was a trial I had to make, monsieur, of pretended servants, who eat
my bread and _should_ defend my person. The trial has succeeded ill,
Monsieur d’Artagnan.”

“For one bad servant your majesty loses,” said the musketeer, with
bitterness, “there are ten who, on that same day, go through a like
ordeal. Listen to me, sire; I am not accustomed to that service. Mine
is a rebel sword when I am required to do ill. It was ill to send me
in pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet, your majesty’s preserver,
implored you to save. Still further, these men were my friends. They did
not attack your majesty, they succumbed to your blind anger. Besides,
why were they not allowed to escape? What crime had they committed? I
admit you may contest with me the right of judging their conduct.
But why suspect me before the action? Why surround me with spies? Why
disgrace me before the army? Why me, in whom till now you showed the
most entire confidence--who for thirty years have been attached to your
person, and have given you a thousand proofs of my devotion--for it must
be said, now that I am accused--why reduce me to see three thousand of
the king’s soldiers march in battle against two men?”

“One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me!” said
the king, in a hollow voice, “and that it was no merit of theirs I was
not lost.”

“Sire, one would imagine you forget that I was there.”

“Enough, Monsieur d’Artagnan, enough of these dominating interests which
arise to keep the sun itself from my interests. I am founding a state in
which there shall be but one master, as I promised you; the moment is at
hand for me to keep my promise. You wish to be, according to your tastes
or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies? I
will thwart you or will drop you--seek a more compliant master. I know
full well that another king would not conduct himself as I do, and would
allow himself to be dominated by you, at the risk of sending you
some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest; but I have an
excellent memory, and for me, services are sacred titles to gratitude,
to impunity. You shall only have this lesson, Monsieur d’Artagnan, as
the punishment of your want of discipline, and I will not imitate my
predecessors in anger, not having imitated them in favor. And, then,
other reasons make me act mildly towards you; in the first place,
because you are a man of sense, a man of excellent sense, a man of
heart, and that you will be a capital servant to him who shall have
mastered you; secondly, because you will cease to have any motives for
insubordination. Your friends are now destroyed or ruined by me. These
supports on which your capricious mind instinctively relied I have
caused to disappear. At this moment, my soldiers have taken or killed
the rebels of Belle-Isle.”

D’Artagnan became pale. “Taken or killed!” cried he. “Oh! sire, if you
thought what you tell, if you were sure you were telling me the truth,
I should forget all that is just, all that is magnanimous in your words,
to call you a barbarous king, and an unnatural man. But I pardon you
these words,” said he, smiling with pride; “I pardon them to a young
prince who does not know, who cannot comprehend what such men as M.
d’Herblay, M. du Vallon, and myself are. Taken or killed! Ah! Ah! sire!
tell me, if the news is true, how much has it cost you in men and money.
We will then reckon if the game has been worth the stakes.”

As he spoke thus, the king went up to him in great anger, and said,
“Monsieur d’Artagnan, your replies are those of a rebel! Tell me, if you
please, who is king of France? Do you know any other?”

“Sire,” replied the captain of the musketeers, coldly, “I very well
remember that one morning at Vaux you addressed that question to many
people who did not answer to it, whilst I, on my part, did answer to
it. If I recognized my king on that day, when the thing was not easy,
I think it would be useless to ask the question of me now, when your
majesty and I are alone.”

At these words Louis cast down his eyes. It appeared to him that the
shade of the unfortunate Philippe passed between D’Artagnan and himself,
to evoke the remembrance of that terrible adventure. Almost at the same
moment an officer entered and placed a dispatch in the hands of the
king, who, in his turn, changed color, while reading it.

“Monsieur,” said he, “what I learn here you would know later; it is
better I should tell you, and that you should learn it from the mouth of
your king. A battle has taken place at Belle-Isle.”

“Is it possible?” said D’Artagnan, with a calm air, though his heart was
beating fast enough to choke him. “Well, sire?”

“Well, monsieur--and I have lost a hundred and ten men.”

A beam of joy and pride shone in the eyes of D’Artagnan. “And the
rebels?” said he.

“The rebels have fled,” said the king.

D’Artagnan could not restrain a cry of triumph. “Only,” added the king,
“I have a fleet which closely blockades Belle-Isle, and I am certain not
a bark can escape.”

“So that,” said the musketeer, brought back to his dismal idea, “if
these two gentlemen are taken--”

“They will be hanged,” said the king, quietly.

“And do they know it?” replied D’Artagnan, repressing his trembling.

“They know it, because you must have told them yourself; and all the
country knows it.”

“Then, sire, they will never be taken alive, I will answer for that.”

“Ah!” said the king, negligently, and taking up his letter again. “Very
well, they will be dead, then, Monsieur d’Artagnan, and that will come
to the same thing, since I should only take them to have them hanged.”

D’Artagnan wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow.

“I have told you,” pursued Louis XIV., “that I would one day be an
affectionate, generous, and constant master. You are now the only man of
former times worthy of my anger or my friendship. I will not spare you
either sentiment, according to your conduct. Could you serve a king,
Monsieur d’Artagnan, who should have a hundred kings, his equals, in
the kingdom? Could I, tell me, do with such weak instruments the great
things I meditate? Did you ever see an artist effect great works with
an unworthy tool? Far from us, monsieur, the old leaven of feudal abuse!
The Fronde, which threatened to ruin monarchy, has emancipated it. I
am master at home, Captain d’Artagnan, and I shall have servants who,
lacking, perhaps, your genius, will carry devotion and obedience to the
verge of heroism. Of what consequence, I ask you, of what consequence
is it that God has given no sense to arms and legs? It is to the head he
has given genius, and the head, you know, the rest obey. I am the head.”

D’Artagnan started. Louis XIV. continued as if he had seen nothing,
although this emotion had not by any means escaped him. “Now, let us
conclude between us two the bargain I promised to make with you one day
when you found me in a very strange predicament at Blois. Do me justice,
monsieur, when you admit I do not make any one pay for the tears of
shame that I then shed. Look around you; lofty heads have bowed. Bow
yours, or choose such exile as will suit you. Perhaps, when reflecting
upon it, you will find your king has a generous heart, who reckons
sufficiently upon your loyalty to allow you to leave him dissatisfied,
when you possess a great state secret. You are a brave man; I know you
to be so. Why have you judged me prematurely? Judge me from this day
forward, D’Artagnan, and be as severe as you please.”

D’Artagnan remained bewildered, mute, undecided for the first time in
his life. At last he had found an adversary worthy of him. This was no
longer trick, it was calculation; no longer violence, but strength; no
longer passion, but will; no longer boasting, but council. This young
man who had brought down a Fouquet, and could do without a D’Artagnan,
deranged the somewhat headstrong calculations of the musketeer.

“Come, let us see what stops you?” said the king, kindly. “You have
given in your resignation; shall I refuse to accept it? I admit that it
may be hard for such an old captain to recover lost good-humor.”

“Oh!” replied D’Artagnan, in a melancholy tone, “that is not my most
serious care. I hesitate to take back my resignation because I am old in
comparison with you, and have habits difficult to abandon. Henceforward,
you must have courtiers who know how to amuse you--madmen who will get
themselves killed to carry out what you call your great works. Great
they will be, I feel--but, if by chance I should not think them so?
I have seen war, sire, I have seen peace; I have served Richelieu and
Mazarin; I have been scorched with your father, at the fire of Rochelle;
riddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve, having grown a new skin ten
times, as serpents do. After affronts and injustices, I have a command
which was formerly something, because it gave the bearer the right of
speaking as he liked to his king. But your captain of the musketeers
will henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors. Truly, sire,
if that is to be my employment from this time, seize the opportunity of
our being on good terms, to take it from me. Do not imagine that I bear
malice; no, you have tamed me, as you say; but it must be confessed that
in taming me you have lowered me; by bowing me you have convicted me of
weakness. If you knew how well it suits me to carry my head high,
and what a pitiful mien I shall have while scenting the dust of your
carpets! Oh! sire, I regret sincerely, and you will regret as I do, the
old days when the king of France saw in every vestibule those insolent
gentlemen, lean, always swearing--cross-grained mastiffs, who could bite
mortally in the hour of danger or of battle. These men were the best of
courtiers to the hand which fed them--they would lick it; but for the
hand that struck them, oh! the bite that followed! A little gold on the
lace of their cloaks, a slender stomach in their _hauts-de-chausses_,
a little sparkling of gray in their dry hair, and you will behold the
handsome dukes and peers, the haughty _marechaux_ of France. But why
should I tell you all this? The king is master; he wills that I
should make verses, he wills that I should polish the mosaics of his
ante-chambers with satin shoes. _Mordioux!_ that is difficult, but I
have got over greater difficulties. I will do it. Why should I do it?
Because I love money?--I have enough. Because I am ambitious?--my career
is almost at an end. Because I love the court? No. I will remain here
because I have been accustomed for thirty years to go and take the
orderly word of the king, and to have said to me ‘Good evening,
D’Artagnan,’ with a smile I did not beg for. That smile I will beg for!
Are you content, sire?” And D’Artagnan bowed his silver head, upon which
the smiling king placed his white hand with pride.

 “Thanks, my old servant, my faithful friend,” said he. “As, reckoning
from this day, I have no longer any enemies in France, it remains with
me to send you to a foreign field to gather your marshal’s baton. Depend
upon me for finding you an opportunity. In the meanwhile, eat of my very
best bread, and sleep in absolute tranquillity.”

“That is all kind and well!” said D’Artagnan, much agitated. “But those
poor men at Belle-Isle? One of them, in particular--so good! so brave!
so true!”

“Do you ask their pardon of me?”

“Upon my knees, sire!”

“Well! then, go and take it to them, if it be still in time. But do you
answer for them?”

“With my life, sire.”

“Go, then. To-morrow I set out for Paris. Return by that time, for I do
not wish you to leave me in the future.”

“Be assured of that, sire,” said D’Artagnan, kissing the royal hand.

And with a heart swelling with joy, he rushed out of the castle on his
way to Belle-Isle.



Chapter LIV. M. Fouquet’s Friends.

The king had returned to Paris, and with him D’Artagnan, who, in
twenty-four hours, having made with greatest care all possible inquiries
at Belle-Isle, succeeded in learning nothing of the secret so well kept
by the heavy rock of Locmaria, which had fallen on the heroic Porthos.
The captain of the musketeers only knew what those two valiant
men--these two friends, whose defense he had so nobly taken up, whose
lives he had so earnestly endeavored to save--aided by three faithful
Bretons, had accomplished against a whole army. He had seen, spread on
the neighboring heath, the human remains which had stained with clouted
blood the scattered stones among the flowering broom. He learned also
that a bark had been seen far out at sea, and that, like a bird of prey,
a royal vessel had pursued, overtaken, and devoured the poor little
bird that was flying with such palpitating wings. But there D’Artagnan’s
certainties ended. The field of supposition was thrown open. Now, what
could he conjecture? The vessel had not returned. It is true that a
brisk wind had prevailed for three days; but the corvette was known to
be a good sailer and solid in its timbers; it had no need to fear a gale
of wind, and it ought, according to the calculation of D’Artagnan, to
have either returned to Brest, or come back to the mouth of the Loire.
Such was the news, ambiguous, it is true, but in some degree reassuring
to him personally, which D’Artagnan brought to Louis XIV., when the
king, followed by all the court, returned to Paris.

Louis, satisfied with his success--Louis, more mild and affable as he
felt himself more powerful--had not ceased for an instant to ride beside
the carriage door of Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Everybody was anxious
to amuse the two queens, so as to make them forget this abandonment by
son and husband. Everything breathed the future, the past was nothing to
anybody. Only that past was like a painful bleeding wound to the hearts
of certain tender and devoted spirits. Scarcely was the king reinstalled
in Paris, when he received a touching proof of this. Louis XIV. had
just risen and taken his first repast when his captain of the musketeers
presented himself before him. D’Artagnan was pale and looked unhappy.
The king, at the first glance, perceived the change in a countenance
generally so unconcerned. “What is the matter, D’Artagnan?” said he.

“Sire, a great misfortune has happened to me.”

“Good heavens! what is that?”

“Sire, I have lost one of my friends, M. du Vallon, in the affair of
Belle-Isle.”

And, while speaking these words, D’Artagnan fixed his falcon eye upon
Louis XIV., to catch the first feeling that would show itself.

“I knew it,” replied the king, quietly.

“You knew it, and did not tell me!” cried the musketeer.

“To what good? Your grief, my friend, was so well worthy of respect. It
was my duty to treat it gently. To have informed you of this misfortune,
which I knew would pain you so greatly, D’Artagnan, would have been, in
your eyes, to have triumphed over you. Yes, I knew that M. du Vallon had
buried himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria; I knew that M. d’Herblay
had taken one of my vessels with its crew, and had compelled it to
convey him to Bayonne. But I was willing you should learn these matters
in a direct manner, in order that you might be convinced my friends are
with me respected and sacred; that always in me the man will sacrifice
himself to subjects, whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men
to majesty and power.”

“But, sire, how could you know?”

“How do you yourself know, D’Artagnan?”

“By this letter, sire, which M. d’Herblay, free and out of danger,
writes me from Bayonne.”

“Look here,” said the king, drawing from a casket placed upon the table
closet to the seat upon which D’Artagnan was leaning, “here is a letter
copied exactly from that of M. d’Herblay. Here is the very letter, which
Colbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours. I am well
served, you may perceive.”

“Yes, sire,” murmured the musketeer, “you were the only man whose star
was equal to the task of dominating the fortune and strength of my two
friends. You have used your power, sire, you will not abuse it, will
you?”

“D’Artagnan,” said the king, with a smile beaming with kindness, “I
could have M. d’Herblay carried off from the territories of the king
of Spain, and brought here, alive, to inflict justice upon him. But,
D’Artagnan, be assured I will not yield to this first and natural
impulse. He is free--let him continue free.”

“Oh, sire! you will not always remain so clement, so noble, so generous
as you have shown yourself with respect to me and M. d’Herblay; you will
have about you counselors who will cure you of that weakness.”

“No, D’Artagnan, you are mistaken when you accuse my council of urging
me to pursue rigorous measures. The advice to spare M. d’Herblay comes
from Colbert himself.”

“Oh, sire!” said D’Artagnan, extremely surprised.

“As for you,” continued the king, with a kindness very uncommon to him,
“I have several pieces of good news to announce to you; but you shall
know them, my dear captain, the moment I have made my accounts all
straight. I have said that I wish to make, and would make, your fortune;
that promise will soon become reality.”

“A thousand times thanks, sire! I can wait. But I implore you, whilst I
go and practice patience, that your majesty will deign to notice those
poor people who have for so long a time besieged your ante-chamber, and
come humbly to lay a petition at your feet.”

“Who are they?”

“Enemies of your majesty.” The king raised his head.

“Friends of M. Fouquet,” added D’Artagnan.

“Their names?”

“M. Gourville, M. Pelisson, and a poet, M. Jean de la Fontaine.”

The king took a moment to reflect. “What do they want?”

“I do not know.”

“How do they appear?”

“In great affliction.”

“What do they say?”

“Nothing.”

“What do they do?”

“They weep.”

“Let them come in,” said the king, with a serious brow.

D’Artagnan turned rapidly on his heel, raised the tapestry which closed
the entrance to the royal chamber, and directing his voice to the
adjoining room, cried, “Enter.”

The three men D’Artagnan had named immediately appeared at the door of
the cabinet in which were the king and his captain. A profound silence
prevailed in their passage. The courtiers, at the approach of the
friends of the unfortunate superintendent of finances, drew back, as
if fearful of being affected by contagion with disgrace and misfortune.
D’Artagnan, with a quick step, came forward to take by the hand the
unhappy men who stood trembling at the door of the cabinet; he led them
in front of the king’s _fauteuil_, who, having placed himself in the
embrasure of a window, awaited the moment of presentation, and was
preparing himself to give the supplicants a rigorously diplomatic
reception.

The first of the friends of Fouquet’s to advance was Pelisson. He did
not weep, but his tears were only restrained that the king might better
hear his voice and prayer. Gourville bit his lips to check his tears,
out of respect for the king. La Fontaine buried his face in his
handkerchief, and the only signs of life he gave were the convulsive
motions of his shoulders, raised by his sobs.

The king preserved his dignity. His countenance was impassible. He
even maintained the frown which appeared when D’Artagnan announced his
enemies. He made a gesture which signified, “Speak;” and he remained
standing, with his eyes fixed searchingly on these desponding men.
Pelisson bowed to the ground, and La Fontaine knelt as people do in
churches. This dismal silence, disturbed only by sighs and groans, began
to excite in the king, not compassion, but impatience.

“Monsieur Pelisson,” said he, in a sharp, dry tone. “Monsieur Gourville,
and you, Monsieur--” and he did not name La Fontaine, “I cannot, without
sensible displeasure, see you come to plead for one of the greatest
criminals it is the duty of justice to punish. A king does not allow
himself to soften save at the tears of the innocent, the remorse of the
guilty. I have no faith either in the remorse of M. Fouquet or the tears
of his friends, because the one is tainted to the very heart, and the
others ought to dread offending me in my own palace. For these reasons,
I beg you, Monsieur Pelisson, Monsieur Gourville, and you, Monsieur--,
to say nothing that will not plainly proclaim the respect you have for
my will.”

“Sire,” replied Pelisson, trembling at these words, “we are come to say
nothing to your majesty that is not the most profound expression of
the most sincere respect and love that are due to a king from all his
subjects. Your majesty’s justice is redoubtable; every one must yield to
the sentences it pronounces. We respectfully bow before it. Far from us
the idea of coming to defend him who has had the misfortune to offend
your majesty. He who has incurred your displeasure may be a friend of
ours, but he is an enemy to the state. We abandon him, but with tears,
to the severity of the king.”

“Besides,” interrupted the king, calmed by that supplicating voice,
and those persuasive words, “my parliament will decide. I do not strike
without first having weighed the crime; my justice does not wield the
sword without employing first a pair of scales.”

“Therefore we have every confidence in that impartiality of the king,
and hope to make our feeble voices heard, with the consent of your
majesty, when the hour for defending an accused friend strikes.”

“In that case, messieurs, what do you ask of me?” said the king, with
his most imposing air.

“Sire,” continued Pelisson, “the accused has a wife and family. The
little property he had was scarcely sufficient to pay his debts,
and Madame Fouquet, since her husband’s captivity, is abandoned by
everybody. The hand of your majesty strikes like the hand of God. When
the Lord sends the curse of leprosy or pestilence into a family,
every one flies and shuns the abode of the leprous or plague-stricken.
Sometimes, but very rarely, a generous physician alone ventures to
approach the ill-reputed threshold, passes it with courage, and risks
his life to combat death. He is the last resource of the dying, the
chosen instrument of heavenly mercy. Sire, we supplicate you, with
clasped hands and bended knees, as a divinity is supplicated! Madame
Fouquet has no longer any friends, no longer any means of support; she
weeps in her deserted home, abandoned by all those who besieged its
doors in the hour of prosperity; she has neither credit nor hope left.
At least, the unhappy wretch upon whom your anger falls receives from
you, however culpable he may be, his daily bread though moistened by
his tears. As much afflicted, more destitute than her husband, Madame
Fouquet--the lady who had the honor to receive your majesty at her
table--Madame Fouquet, the wife of the ancient superintendent of your
majesty’s finances, Madame Fouquet has no longer bread.”

Here the mortal silence which had chained the breath of Pelisson’s two
friends was broken by an outburst of sobs; and D’Artagnan, whose chest
heaved at hearing this humble prayer, turned round towards the angle of
the cabinet to bite his mustache and conceal a groan.

The king had preserved his eye dry and his countenance severe; but
the blood had mounted to his cheeks, and the firmness of his look was
visibly diminished.

“What do you wish?” said he, in an agitated voice.

“We come humbly to ask your majesty,” replied Pelisson, upon whom
emotion was fast gaining, “to permit us, without incurring the
displeasure of your majesty, to lend to Madame Fouquet two thousand
pistoles collected among the old friends of her husband, in order that
the widow may not stand in need of the necessaries of life.”

At the word _widow_, pronounced by Pelisson whilst Fouquet was still
alive, the king turned very pale;--his pride disappeared; pity rose from
his heart to his lips; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt
sobbing at his feet.

“God forbid,” said he, “that I should confound the innocent with the
guilty. They know me but ill who doubt my mercy towards the weak. I
strike none but the arrogant. Do, messieurs, do all that your hearts
counsel you to assuage the grief of Madame Fouquet. Go, messieurs--go!”

The three now rose in silence with dry eyes. The tears had been scorched
away by contact with their burning cheeks and eyelids. They had not
the strength to address their thanks to the king, who himself cut short
their solemn reverences by entrenching himself suddenly behind the
_fauteuil_.

D’Artagnan remained alone with the king.

“Well,” said he, approaching the young prince, who interrogated him with
his look. “Well, my master! If you had not the device which belongs to
your sun, I would recommend you one which M. Conrart might translate
into eclectic Latin, ‘Calm with the lowly; stormy with the strong.’”

The king smiled, and passed into the next apartment, after having said
to D’Artagnan, “I give you the leave of absence you must want to put the
affairs of your friend, the late M. du Vallon, in order.”



Chapter LV. Porthos’s Will.

At Pierrefonds everything was in mourning. The courts were deserted--the
stables closed--the parterres neglected. In the basins, the fountains,
formerly so jubilantly fresh and noisy, had stopped of themselves. Along
the roads around the chateau came a few grave personages mounted on
mules or country nags. These were rural neighbors, cures and bailiffs of
adjacent estates. All these people entered the chateau silently, handed
their horses to a melancholy-looking groom, and directed their steps,
conducted by a huntsman in black, to the great dining-room, where
Mousqueton received them at the door. Mousqueton had become so thin in
two days that his clothes moved upon him like an ill-fitting scabbard in
which the sword-blade dances at each motion. His face, composed of red
and white, like that of the Madonna of Vandyke, was furrowed by two
silver rivulets which had dug their beds in his cheeks, as full formerly
as they had become flabby since his grief began. At each fresh arrival,
Mousqueton found fresh tears, and it was pitiful to see him press
his throat with his fat hand to keep from bursting into sobs and
lamentations. All these visits were for the purpose of hearing the
reading of Porthos’s will, announced for that day, and at which all the
covetous friends of the dead man were anxious to be present, as he had
left no relations behind him.

The visitors took their places as they arrived, and the great room had
just been closed when the clock struck twelve, the hour fixed for the
reading of the important document. Porthos’s procureur--and that
was naturally the successor of Master Coquenard--commenced by slowly
unfolding the vast parchment upon which the powerful hand of Porthos had
traced his sovereign will. The seal broken--the spectacles put on--the
preliminary cough having sounded--every one pricked up his ears.
Mousqueton had squatted himself in a corner, the better to weep and the
better to hear. All at once the folding-doors of the great room, which
had been shut, were thrown open as if by magic, and a warlike figure
appeared upon the threshold, resplendent in the full light of the sun.
This was D’Artagnan, who had come alone to the gate, and finding nobody
to hold his stirrup, had tied his horse to the knocker and announced
himself. The splendor of daylight invading the room, the murmur of all
present, and, more than all, the instinct of the faithful dog, drew
Mousqueton from his reverie; he raised his head, recognized the old
friend of his master, and, screaming with grief, he embraced his knees,
watering the floor with his tears. D’Artagnan raised the poor intendant,
embraced him as if he had been a brother, and, having nobly saluted the
assembly, who all bowed as they whispered to each other his name, he
went and took his seat at the extremity of the great carved oak hall,
still holding by the hand poor Mousqueton, who was suffocating with
excess of woe, and sank upon the steps. Then the procureur, who, like
the rest, was considerably agitated, commenced.

Porthos, after a profession of faith of the most Christian character,
asked pardon of his enemies for all the injuries he might have done
them. At this paragraph, a ray of inexpressible pride beamed from the
eyes of D’Artagnan.

He recalled to his mind the old soldier; all those enemies of Porthos
brought to earth by his valiant hand; he reckoned up the numbers
of them, and said to himself that Porthos had acted wisely, not to
enumerate his enemies or the injuries done to them, or the task would
have been too much for the reader. Then came the following schedule of
his extensive lands:

“I possess at this present time, by the grace of God--

“1. The domain of Pierrefonds, lands, woods, meadows, waters, and
forests, surrounded by good walls.

“2. The domain of Bracieux, chateaux, forests, plowed lands, forming
three farms.

“3. The little estate Du Vallon, so named because it is in the valley.”
 (Brave Porthos!)

“4. Fifty farms in Touraine, amounting to five hundred acres.

“5. Three mills upon the Cher, bringing in six hundred livres each.

“6. Three fish-pools in Berry, producing two hundred livres a year.

“As to my personal or movable property, so called because it can be
moved, as is so well explained by my learned friend the bishop of
Vannes--” (D’Artagnan shuddered at the dismal remembrance attached to
that name)--the procureur continued imperturbably--“they consist--”

“1. In goods which I cannot detail here for want of room, and which
furnish all my chateaux or houses, but of which the list is drawn up by
my intendant.”

Every one turned his eyes towards Mousqueton, who was still lost in
grief.

“2. In twenty horses for saddle and draught, which I have particularly
at my chateau of Pierrefonds, and which are called--Bayard, Roland,
Charlemagne, Pepin, Dunois, La Hire, Ogier, Samson, Milo, Nimrod,
Urganda, Armida, Flastrade, Dalilah, Rebecca, Yolande, Finette,
Grisette, Lisette, and Musette.

“3. In sixty dogs, forming six packs, divided as follows: the first, for
the stag; the second, for the wolf; the third, for the wild boar; the
fourth, for the hare; and the two others, for setters and protection.

“4. In arms for war and the chase contained in my gallery of arms.

“5. My wines of Anjou, selected for Athos, who liked them formerly;
my wines of Burgundy, Champagne, Bordeaux, and Spain, stocking eight
cellars and twelve vaults, in my various houses.

“6. My pictures and statues, which are said to be of great value, and
which are sufficiently numerous to fatigue the sight.

“7. My library, consisting of six thousand volumes, quite new, and have
never been opened.

“8. My silver plate, which is perhaps a little worn, but which ought to
weigh from a thousand to twelve hundred pounds, for I had great trouble
in lifting the coffer that contained it and could not carry it more than
six times round my chamber.

“9. All these objects, in addition to the table and house linen, are
divided in the residences I liked the best.”

Here the reader stopped to take breath. Every one sighed, coughed, and
redoubled his attention. The procureur resumed:

“I have lived without having any children, and it is probable I never
shall have any, which to me is a cutting grief. And yet I am mistaken,
for I have a son, in common with my other friends; that is, M. Raoul
Auguste Jules de Bragelonne, the true son of M. le Comte de la Fere.

“This young nobleman appears to me extremely worthy to succeed the
valiant gentleman of whom I am the friend and very humble servant.”

Here a sharp sound interrupted the reader. It was D’Artagnan’s sword,
which, slipping from his baldric, had fallen on the sonorous flooring.
Every one turned his eyes that way, and saw that a large tear had rolled
from the thick lid of D’Artagnan, half-way down to his aquiline nose,
the luminous edge of which shone like a little crescent moon.

“This is why,” continued the procureur, “I have left all my property,
movable, or immovable, comprised in the above enumerations, to M. le
Vicomte Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne, son of M. le Comte de la
Fere, to console him for the grief he seems to suffer, and enable him to
add more luster to his already glorious name.”

A vague murmur ran through the auditory. The procureur continued,
seconded by the flashing eye of D’Artagnan, which, glancing over the
assembly, quickly restored the interrupted silence:

“On condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do give to M. le
Chevalier d’Artagnan, captain of the king’s musketeers, whatever the
said Chevalier d’Artagnan may demand of my property. On condition that
M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do pay a good pension to M. le Chevalier
d’Herblay, my friend, if he should need it in exile. I leave to my
intendant Mousqueton all of my clothes, of city, war, or chase, to the
number of forty-seven suits, in the assurance that he will wear them
till they are worn out, for the love of and in remembrance of his
master. Moreover, I bequeath to M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne my old
servant and faithful friend Mousqueton, already named, providing that
the said vicomte shall so act that Mousqueton shall declare, when dying,
he has never ceased to be happy.”

On hearing these words, Mousqueton bowed, pale and trembling; his
shoulders shook convulsively; his countenance, compressed by a frightful
grief, appeared from between his icy hands, and the spectators saw him
stagger and hesitate, as if, though wishing to leave the hall, he did
not know the way.

“Mousqueton, my good friend,” said D’Artagnan, “go and make your
preparations. I will take you with me to Athos’s house, whither I shall
go on leaving Pierrefonds.”

Mousqueton made no reply. He scarcely breathed, as if everything in that
hall would from that time be foreign. He opened the door, and slowly
disappeared.

The procureur finished his reading, after which the greater part
of those who had come to hear the last will of Porthos dispersed by
degrees, many disappointed, but all penetrated with respect. As
for D’Artagnan, thus left alone, after having received the formal
compliments of the procureur, he was lost in admiration of the wisdom of
the testator, who had so judiciously bestowed his wealth upon the most
necessitous and the most worthy, with a delicacy that neither nobleman
nor courtier could have displayed more kindly. When Porthos enjoined
Raoul de Bragelonne to give D’Artagnan all that he would ask, he knew
well, our worthy Porthos, that D’Artagnan would ask or take nothing; and
in case he did demand anything, none but himself could say what. Porthos
left a pension to Aramis, who, if he should be inclined to ask too much,
was checked by the example of D’Artagnan; and that word _exile_, thrown
out by the testator, without apparent intention, was it not the mildest,
most exquisite criticism upon that conduct of Aramis which had brought
about the death of Porthos? But there was no mention of Athos in the
testament of the dead. Could the latter for a moment suppose that the
son would not offer the best part to the father? The rough mind of
Porthos had fathomed all these causes, seized all these shades more
clearly than law, better than custom, with more propriety than taste.

“Porthos had indeed a heart,” said D’Artagnan to himself with a sigh.
As he made this reflection, he fancied he hard a groan in the room above
him; and he thought immediately of poor Mousqueton, whom he felt it was
a pleasing duty to divert from his grief. For this purpose he left the
hall hastily to seek the worthy intendant, as he had not returned. He
ascended the staircase leading to the first story, and perceived, in
Porthos’s own chamber, a heap of clothes of all colors and materials,
upon which Mousqueton had laid himself down after heaping them all on
the floor together. It was the legacy of the faithful friend. Those
clothes were truly his own; they had been given to him; the hand of
Mousqueton was stretched over these relics, which he was kissing with
his lips, with all his face, and covered with his body. D’Artagnan
approached to console the poor fellow.

“My God!” said he, “he does not stir--he has fainted!”

But D’Artagnan was mistaken. Mousqueton was dead! Dead, like the dog
who, having lost his master, crawls back to die upon his cloak.



Chapter LVI. The Old Age of Athos.

While these affairs were separating forever the four musketeers,
formerly bound together in a manner that seemed indissoluble, Athos,
left alone after the departure of Raoul, began to pay his tribute to
that foretaste of death which is called the absence of those we love.
Back in his house at Blois, no longer having even Grimaud to receive
a poor smile as he passed through the parterre, Athos daily felt
the decline of vigor of a nature which for so long a time had seemed
impregnable. Age, which had been kept back by the presence of the
beloved object, arrived with that _cortege_ of pains and inconveniences,
which grows by geometrical accretion. Athos had no longer his son to
induce him to walk firmly, with head erect, as a good example; he had no
longer, in those brilliant eyes of the young man, an ever-ardent focus
at which to kindle anew the fire of his looks. And then, must it be
said, that nature, exquisite in tenderness and reserve, no longer
finding anything to understand its feelings, gave itself up to grief
with all the warmth of common natures when they yield to joy. The Comte
de la Fere, who had remained a young man to his sixty-second year;
the warrior who had preserved his strength in spite of fatigue; his
freshness of mind in spite of misfortune, his mild serenity of soul and
body in spite of Milady, in spite of Mazarin, in spite of La Valliere;
Athos had become an old man in a week, from the moment at which he lost
the comfort of his later youth. Still handsome, though bent, noble, but
sad, he sought, since his solitude, the deeper glades where sunshine
scarcely penetrated. He discontinued all the mighty exercises he had
enjoyed through life, when Raoul was no longer with him. The servants,
accustomed to see him stirring with the dawn at all seasons, were
astonished to hear seven o’clock strike before their master quitted his
bed. Athos remained in bed with a book under his pillow--but he did not
sleep, neither did he read. Remaining in bed that he might no longer
have to carry his body, he allowed his soul and spirit to wander from
their envelope and return to his son, or to God. [6]

His people were sometimes terrified to see him, for hours together,
absorbed in silent reverie, mute and insensible; he no longer heard the
timid step of the servant who came to the door of his chamber to watch
the sleeping or waking of his master. It often occurred that he forgot
the day had half passed away, that the hours for the two first meals
were gone by. Then he was awakened. He rose, descended to his shady
walk, then came out a little into the sun, as though to partake of its
warmth for a minute in memory of his absent child. And then the dismal
monotonous walk recommenced, until, exhausted, he regained the chamber
and his bed, his domicile by choice. For several days the comte did not
speak a single word. He refused to receive the visits that were paid
him, and during the night he was seen to relight his lamp and pass long
hours in writing, or examining parchments.

Athos wrote one of these letters to Vannes, another to Fontainebleau;
they remained without answers. We know why: Aramis had quitted France,
and D’Artagnan was traveling from Nantes to Paris, from Paris to
Pierrefonds. His _valet de chambre_ observed that he shortened his walk
every day by several turns. The great alley of limes soon became too
long for feet that used to traverse it formerly a hundred times a day.
The comte walked feebly as far as the middle trees, seated himself upon
a mossy bank that sloped towards a sidewalk, and there waited the return
of his strength, or rather the return of night. Very shortly a hundred
steps exhausted him. At length Athos refused to rise at all; he declined
all nourishment, and his terrified people, although he did not complain,
although he wore a smile upon his lips, although he continued to speak
with his sweet voice--his people went to Blois in search of the ancient
physician of the late Monsieur, and brought him to the Comte de la Fere
in such a fashion that he could see the comte without being himself
seen. For this purpose, they placed him in a closet adjoining the
chamber of the patient, and implored him not to show himself, for fear
of displeasing their master, who had not asked for a physician. The
doctor obeyed. Athos was a sort of model for the gentlemen of the
country; the Blaisois boasted of possessing this sacred relic of French
glory. Athos was a great seigneur compared with such nobles as the king
improvised by touching with his artificial scepter the patched-up trunks
of the heraldic trees of the province.

People respected Athos, we say, and they loved him. The physician could
not bear to see his people weep, to see flock round him the poor of the
canton, to whom Athos had so often given life and consolation by his
kind words and his charities. He examined, therefore, from the depths
of his hiding-place, the nature of that mysterious malady which bent
and aged more mortally every day a man but lately so full of life and a
desire to live. He remarked upon the cheeks of Athos the hectic hue of
fever, which feeds upon itself; slow fever, pitiless, born in a fold
of the heart, sheltering itself behind that rampart, growing from
the suffering it engenders, at once cause and effect of a perilous
situation. The comte spoke to nobody; he did not even talk to
himself. His thought feared noise; it approached to that degree of
over-excitement which borders upon ecstasy. Man thus absorbed, though he
does not yet belong to God, already appertains no longer to the earth.
The doctor remained for several hours studying this painful struggle of
the will against superior power; he was terrified at seeing those eyes
always fixed, ever directed on some invisible object; was terrified at
the monotonous beating of that heart from which never a sigh arose
to vary the melancholy state; for often pain becomes the hope of the
physician. Half a day passed away thus. The doctor formed his resolution
like a brave man; he issued suddenly from his place of retreat, and went
straight up to Athos, who beheld him without evincing more surprise than
if he had understood nothing of the apparition.

“Monsieur le comte, I crave your pardon,” said the doctor, coming up
to the patient with open arms; “but I have a reproach to make you--you
shall hear me.” And he seated himself by the pillow of Athos, who had
great trouble in rousing himself from his preoccupation.

“What is the matter, doctor?” asked the comte, after a silence.

“The matter is, you are ill, monsieur, and have had no advice.”

“I! ill!” said Athos, smiling.

“Fever, consumption, weakness, decay, monsieur le comte!”

“Weakness!” replied Athos; “is it possible? I do not get up.”

“Come, come! monsieur le comte, no subterfuges; you are a good
Christian?”

“I hope so,” said Athos.

“Is it your wish to kill yourself?”

“Never, doctor.”

“Well! monsieur, you are in a fair way of doing so. Thus to remain is
suicide. Get well! monsieur le comte, get well!”

“Of what? Find the disease first. For my part, I never knew myself
better; never did the sky appear more blue to me; never did I take more
care of my flowers.”

“You have a hidden grief.”

“Concealed!--not at all; the absence of my son, doctor; that is my
malady, and I do not conceal it.”

“Monsieur le comte, your son lives, he is strong, he has all the future
before him--the future of men of merit, of his race; live for him--”

“But I do live, doctor; oh! be satisfied of that,” added he, with a
melancholy smile; “for as long as Raoul lives, it will be plainly known,
for as long as he lives, I shall live.”

“What do you say?”

“A very simple thing. At this moment, doctor, I leave life suspended
within me. A forgetful, dissipated, indifferent life would be beyond my
strength, now I have no longer Raoul with me. You do not ask the lamp
to burn when the match has not illumed the flame; do not ask me to live
amidst noise and merriment. I vegetate, I prepare myself, I wait. Look,
doctor; remember those soldiers we have so often seen together at the
ports, where they were waiting to embark; lying down, indifferent, half
on one element, half on the other; they were neither at the place where
the sea was going to carry them, nor at the place the earth was going
to lose them; baggage prepared, minds on the stretch, arms stacked--they
waited. I repeat it, the word is the one which paints my present life.
Lying down like the soldiers, my ear on the stretch for the report that
may reach me, I wish to be ready to set out at the first summons. Who
will make me that summons? life or death? God or Raoul? My baggage
is packed, my soul is prepared, I await the signal--I wait, doctor, I
wait!”

The doctor knew the temper of that mind; he appreciated the strength
of that body; he reflected for the moment, told himself that words
were useless, remedies absurd, and left the chateau, exhorting Athos’s
servants not to quit him for a moment.

The doctor being gone, Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at
having been disturbed. He did not even desire that all letters that
came should be brought to him directly. He knew very well that every
distraction which should arise would be a joy, a hope, which his
servants would have paid with their blood to procure him. Sleep had
become rare. By intense thinking, Athos forgot himself, for a few hours
at most, in a reverie most profound, more obscure than other people
would have called a dream. The momentary repose which this forgetfulness
thus gave the body, still further fatigued the soul, for Athos lived a
double life during these wanderings of his understanding. One night,
he dreamt that Raoul was dressing himself in a tent, to go upon an
expedition commanded by M. de Beaufort in person. The young man was sad;
he clasped his cuirass slowly, and slowly he girded on his sword.

“What is the matter?” asked his father, tenderly.

“What afflicts me is the death of Porthos, ever so dear a friend,”
 replied Raoul. “I suffer here the grief you soon will feel at home.”

And the vision disappeared with the slumber of Athos. At daybreak one of
his servants entered his master’s apartment, and gave him a letter which
came from Spain.

“The writing of Aramis,” thought the comte; and he read.

“Porthos is dead!” cried he, after the first lines. “Oh! Raoul, Raoul!
thanks! thou keepest thy promise, thou warnest me!”

And Athos, seized with a mortal sweat, fainted in his bed, without any
other cause than weakness.



Chapter LVII. Athos’s Vision.

When this fainting of Athos had ceased, the comte, almost ashamed of
having given way before this superior natural event, dressed himself
and ordered his horse, determined to ride to Blois, to open more certain
correspondences with either Africa, D’Artagnan, or Aramis. In fact, this
letter from Aramis informed the Comte de la Fere of the bad success
of the expedition of Belle-Isle. It gave him sufficient details of the
death of Porthos to move the tender and devoted heart of Athos to its
innermost fibers. Athos wished to go and pay his friend Porthos a last
visit. To render this honor to his companion in arms, he meant to send
to D’Artagnan, to prevail upon him to recommence the painful voyage to
Belle-Isle, to accomplish in his company that sad pilgrimage to the tomb
of the giant he had so much loved, then to return to his dwelling to
obey that secret influence which was conducting him to eternity by a
mysterious road. But scarcely had his joyous servants dressed their
master, whom they saw with pleasure preparing for a journey which might
dissipate his melancholy; scarcely had the comte’s gentlest horse been
saddled and brought to the door, when the father of Raoul felt his
head become confused, his legs give way, and he clearly perceived
the impossibility of going one step further. He ordered himself to be
carried into the sun; they laid him upon his bed of moss where he passed
a full hour before he could recover his spirits. Nothing could be more
natural than this weakness after then inert repose of the latter days.
Athos took a _bouillon_, to give him strength, and bathed his dried
lips in a glassful of the wine he loved the best--that old Anjou wine
mentioned by Porthos in his admirable will. Then, refreshed, free in
mind, he had his horse brought again; but only with the aid of his
servants was he able painfully to climb into the saddle. He did not go a
hundred paces; a shivering seized him again at the turning of the road.

“This is very strange!” said he to his _valet de chambre_, who
accompanied him.

“Let us stop, monsieur--I conjure you!” replied the faithful servant;
“how pale you are getting!”

“That will not prevent my pursuing my route, now I have once started,”
 replied the comte. And he gave his horse his head again. But suddenly,
the animal, instead of obeying the thought of his master, stopped. A
movement, of which Athos was unconscious, had checked the bit.

“Something,” said Athos, “wills that I should go no further. Support
me,” added he, stretching out his arms; “quick! come closer! I feel my
muscles relax--I shall fall from my horse.”

The valet had seen the movement made by his master at the moment he
received the order. He went up to him quickly, received the comte in his
arms, and as they were not yet sufficiently distant from the house
for the servants, who had remained at the door to watch their master’s
departure, not to perceive the disorder in the usually regular
proceeding of the comte, the valet called his comrades by gestures and
voice, and all hastened to his assistance. Athos had gone but a few
steps on his return, when he felt himself better again. His strength
seemed to revive and with it the desire to go to Blois. He made his
horse turn round: but, at the animal’s first steps, he sunk again into a
state of torpor and anguish.

“Well! decidedly,” said he, “it is _willed_ that I should stay at home.”
 His people flocked around him; they lifted him from his horse, and
carried him as quickly as possible into the house. Everything was
prepared in his chamber, and they put him to bed.

“You will be sure to remember,” said he, disposing himself to sleep,
“that I expect letters from Africa this very day.”

“Monsieur will no doubt hear with pleasure that Blaisois’s son is gone
on horseback, to gain an hour over the courier of Blois,” replied his
_valet de chambre_.

“Thank you,” replied Athos, with his placid smile.

The comte fell asleep, but his disturbed slumber resembled torture
rather than repose. The servant who watched him saw several times the
expression of internal suffering shadowed on his features. Perhaps Athos
was dreaming.

The day passed away. Blaisois’s son returned; the courier had brought
no news. The comte reckoned the minutes with despair; he shuddered when
those minutes made an hour. The idea that he was forgotten seized him
once, and brought on a fearful pang of the heart. Everybody in the house
had given up all hopes of the courier--his hour had long passed. Four
times the express sent to Blois had repeated his journey, and there was
nothing to the address of the comte. Athos knew that the courier only
arrived once a week. Here, then, was a delay of eight mortal days to be
endured. He commenced the night in this painful persuasion. All that a
sick man, irritated by suffering, can add of melancholy suppositions to
probabilities already gloomy, Athos heaped up during the early hours of
this dismal night. The fever rose: it invaded the chest, where the fire
soon caught, according to the expression of the physician, who had been
brought back from Blois by Blaisois at his last journey. Soon it gained
the head. The physician made two successive bleedings, which dislodged
it for the time, but left the patient very weak, and without power of
action in anything but his brain. And yet this redoubtable fever had
ceased. It besieged with its last palpitations the tense extremities; it
ended by yielding as midnight struck.

The physician, seeing the incontestable improvement, returned to Blois,
after having ordered some prescriptions, and declared that the comte was
saved. Then commenced for Athos a strange, indefinable state. Free to
think, his mind turned towards Raoul, that beloved son. His imagination
penetrated the fields of Africa in the environs of Gigelli, where M. de
Beaufort must have landed with his army. A waste of gray rocks, rendered
green in certain parts by the waters of the sea, when it lashed the
shore in storms and tempest. Beyond, the shore, strewed over with these
rocks like gravestones, ascended, in form of an amphitheater among
mastic-trees and cactus, a sort of small town, full of smoke, confused
noises, and terrified movements. All of a sudden, from the bosom of
this smoke arose a flame, which succeeded, creeping along the houses,
in covering the entire surface of the town, and increased by degrees,
uniting in its red and angry vortices tears, screams, and supplicating
arms outstretched to Heaven.

There was, for a moment, a frightful _pele-mele_ of timbers falling
to pieces, of swords broken, of stones calcined, trees burnt and
disappearing. It was a strange thing that in this chaos, in which Athos
distinguished raised arms, in which he heard cries, sobs, and groans,
he did not see one human figure. The cannon thundered at a distance,
musketry madly barked, the sea moaned, flocks made their escape,
bounding over the verdant slope. But not a soldier to apply the match
to the batteries of cannon, not a sailor to assist in maneuvering the
fleet, not a shepherd in charge of the flocks. After the ruin of the
village, the destruction of the forts which dominated it, a ruin and
destruction magically wrought without the co-operation of a single human
being, the flames were extinguished, the smoke began to subside, then
diminished in intensity, paled and disappeared entirely. Night then came
over the scene; night dark upon the earth, brilliant in the firmament.
The large blazing stars which spangled the African sky glittered and
gleamed without illuminating anything.

A long silence ensued, which gave, for a moment, repose to the troubled
imagination of Athos; and as he felt that that which he saw was not
terminated, he applied more attentively the eyes of his understanding
on the strange spectacle which his imagination had presented. This
spectacle was soon continued for him. A mild pale moon rose behind the
declivities of the coast, streaking at first the undulating ripples of
the sea, which appeared to have calmed after the roaring it had sent
forth during the vision of Athos--the moon, we say, shed its diamonds
and opals upon the briers and bushes of the hills. The gray rocks, so
many silent and attentive phantoms, appeared to raise their heads to
examine likewise the field of battle by the light of the moon, and Athos
perceived that the field, empty during the combat, was now strewn with
fallen bodies.

An inexpressible shudder of fear and horror seized his soul as he
recognized the white and blue uniforms of the soldiers of Picardy,
with their long pikes and blue handles, and muskets marked with the
_fleur-de-lis_ on the butts. When he saw all the gaping wounds, looking
up to the bright heavens as if to demand back of them the souls to which
they had opened a passage,--when he saw the slaughtered horses, stiff,
their tongues hanging out at one side of their mouths, sleeping in the
shiny blood congealed around them, staining their furniture and their
manes,--when he saw the white horse of M. de Beaufort, with his head
beaten to pieces, in the first ranks of the dead, Athos passed a cold
hand over his brow, which he was astonished not to find burning. He was
convinced by this touch that he was present, as a spectator, without
delirium’s dreadful aid, the day after the battle fought upon the shores
of Gigelli by the army of the expedition, which he had seen leave the
coast of France and disappear upon the dim horizon, and of which he had
saluted with thought and gesture the last cannon-shot fired by the duke
as a signal of farewell to his country.

Who can paint the mortal agony with which his soul followed, like a
vigilant eye, these effigies of clay-cold soldiers, and examined them,
one after the other, to see if Raoul slept among them? Who can express
the intoxication of joy with which Athos bowed before God, and thanked
Him for not having seen him he sought with so much fear among the dead?
In fact, fallen in their ranks, stiff, icy, the dead, still recognizable
with ease, seemed to turn with complacency towards the Comte de la Fere,
to be the better seen by him, during his sad review. But yet, he
was astonished, while viewing all these bodies, not to perceive the
survivors. To such a point did the illusion extend, that this vision
was for him a real voyage made by the father into Africa, to obtain more
exact information respecting his son.

Fatigued, therefore, with having traversed seas and continents, he
sought repose under one of the tents sheltered behind a rock, on the
top of which floated the white _fleur-de-lised_ pennon. He looked for
a soldier to conduct him to the tent of M. de Beaufort. Then, while his
eye was wandering over the plain, turning on all sides, he saw a white
form appear behind the scented myrtles. This figure was clothed in the
costume of an officer; it held in its hand a broken sword; it advanced
slowly towards Athos, who, stopping short and fixing his eyes upon it,
neither spoke nor moved, but wished to open his arms, because in this
silent officer he had already recognized Raoul. The comte attempted to
utter a cry, but it was stifled in his throat. Raoul, with a gesture,
directed him to be silent, placing his finger on his lips and drawing
back by degrees, without Athos being able to see his legs move. The
comte, still paler than Raoul, followed his son, painfully traversing
briers and bushes, stones and ditches, Raoul not appearing to touch the
earth, no obstacle seeming to impede the lightness of his march.
The comte, whom the inequalities of the path fatigued, soon stopped,
exhausted. Raoul still continued to beckon him to follow him. The tender
father, to whom love restored strength, made a last effort, and climbed
the mountain after the young man, who attracted him by gesture and by
smile.

At length he gained the crest of the hill, and saw, thrown out in black,
upon the horizon whitened by the moon, the aerial form of Raoul.
Athos reached forth his hand to get closer to his beloved son upon the
plateau, and the latter also stretched out his; but suddenly, as if the
young man had been drawn away in his own despite, still retreating, he
left the earth, and Athos saw the clear blue sky shine between the feet
of his child and the ground of the hill. Raoul rose insensibly into the
void, smiling, still calling with gesture:--he departed towards heaven.
Athos uttered a cry of tenderness and terror. He looked below again. He
saw a camp destroyed, and all those white bodies of the royal army, like
so many motionless atoms. And, then, raising his head, he saw the figure
of his son still beckoning him to climb the mystic void.



Chapter LVIII. The Angel of Death.

Athos was at this part of his marvelous vision, when the charm was
suddenly broken by a great noise rising from the outer gates. A horse
was heard galloping over the hard gravel of the great alley, and the
sound of noisy and animated conversations ascended to the chamber in
which the comte was dreaming. Athos did not stir from the place he
occupied; he scarcely turned his head towards the door to ascertain the
sooner what these noises could be. A heavy step ascended the stairs; the
horse, which had recently galloped, departed slowly towards the stables.
Great hesitation appeared in the steps, which by degrees approached the
chamber. A door was opened, and Athos, turning a little towards the part
of the room the noise came from, cried, in a weak voice:

“It is a courier from Africa, is it not?”

“No, monsieur le comte,” replied a voice which made the father of Raoul
start upright in his bed.

“Grimaud!” murmured he. And the sweat began to pour down his face.
Grimaud appeared in the doorway. It was no longer the Grimaud we have
seen, still young with courage and devotion, when he jumped the first
into the boat destined to convey Raoul de Bragelonne to the vessels of
the royal fleet. ‘Twas now a stern and pale old man, his clothes covered
with dust, and hair whitened by old age. He trembled whilst leaning
against the door-frame, and was near falling on seeing, by the light of
the lamps, the countenance of his master. These two men who had lived so
long together in a community of intelligence, and whose eyes, accustomed
to economize expressions, knew how to say so many things silently--these
two old friends, one as noble as the other in heart, if they were
unequal in fortune and birth, remained tongue-tied whilst looking at
each other. By the exchange of a single glance they had just read to
the bottom of each other’s hearts. The old servitor bore upon his
countenance the impression of a grief already old, the outward token of
a grim familiarity with woe. He appeared to have no longer in use more
than a single version of his thoughts. As formerly he was accustomed not
to speak much, he was now accustomed not to smile at all. Athos read at
a glance all these shades upon the visage of his faithful servant, and
in the same tone he would have employed to speak to Raoul in his dream:

“Grimaud,” said he, “Raoul is dead. _Is it not so?_”

Behind Grimaud the other servants listened breathlessly, with their
eyes fixed upon the bed of their sick master. They heard the terrible
question, and a heart-breaking silence followed.

“Yes,” replied the old man, heaving the monosyllable from his chest with
a hoarse, broken sigh.

Then arose voices of lamentation, which groaned without measure, and
filled with regrets and prayers the chamber where the agonized father
sought with his eyes the portrait of his son. This was for Athos like
the transition which led to his dream. Without uttering a cry, without
shedding a tear, patient, mild, resigned as a martyr, he raised his eyes
towards Heaven, in order there to see again, rising above the mountain
of Gigelli, the beloved shade that was leaving him at the moment of
Grimaud’s arrival. Without doubt, while looking towards the heavens,
resuming his marvelous dream, he repassed by the same road by which the
vision, at once so terrible and sweet, had led him before; for after
having gently closed his eyes, he reopened them and began to smile: he
had just seen Raoul, who had smiled upon him. With his hands joined upon
his breast, his face turned towards the window, bathed by the fresh air
of night, which brought upon its wings the aroma of the flowers and
the woods, Athos entered, never again to come out of it, into the
contemplation of that paradise which the living never see. God willed,
no doubt, to open to this elect the treasures of eternal beatitude,
at this hour when other men tremble with the idea of being severely
received by the Lord, and cling to this life they know, in the dread of
the other life of which they get but merest glimpses by the dismal murky
torch of death. Athos was spirit-guided by the pure serene soul of his
son, which aspired to be like the paternal soul. Everything for this
just man was melody and perfume in the rough road souls take to return
to the celestial country. After an hour of this ecstasy, Athos softly
raised his hands as white as wax; the smile did not quit his lips, and
he murmured low, so low as scarcely to be audible, these three words
addressed to God or to Raoul:

“HERE I AM!”

And his hands fell slowly, as though he himself had laid them on the
bed.

Death had been kind and mild to this noble creature. It had spared him
the tortures of the agony, convulsions of the last departure; had opened
with an indulgent finger the gates of eternity to that noble soul. God
had no doubt ordered it thus that the pious remembrance of this death
should remain in the hearts of those present, and in the memory of other
men--a death which caused to be loved the passage from this life to the
other by those whose existence upon this earth leads them not to dread
the last judgment. Athos preserved, even in the eternal sleep, that
placid and sincere smile--an ornament which was to accompany him to the
tomb. The quietude and calm of his fine features made his servants for
a long time doubt whether he had really quitted life. The comte’s people
wished to remove Grimaud, who, from a distance, devoured the face now
quickly growing marble-pale, and did not approach, from pious fear of
bringing to him the breath of death. But Grimaud, fatigued as he was,
refused to leave the room. He sat himself down upon the threshold,
watching his master with the vigilance of a sentinel, jealous to receive
either his first waking look or his last dying sigh. The noises all were
quiet in the house--every one respected the slumber of their lord. But
Grimaud, by anxiously listening, perceived that the comte no longer
breathed. He raised himself with his hands leaning on the ground, looked
to see if there did not appear some motion in the body of his master.
Nothing! Fear seized him; he rose completely up, and, at the very
moment, heard some one coming up the stairs. A noise of spurs knocking
against a sword--a warlike sound familiar to his ears--stopped him as he
was going towards the bed of Athos. A voice more sonorous than brass or
steel resounded within three paces of him.

“Athos! Athos! my friend!” cried this voice, agitated even to tears.

“Monsieur le Chevalier d’Artagnan,” faltered out Grimaud.

“Where is he? Where is he?” continued the musketeer. Grimaud seized
his arm in his bony fingers, and pointed to the bed, upon the sheets of
which the livid tints of death already showed.

A choked respiration, the opposite to a sharp cry, swelled the throat of
D’Artagnan. He advanced on tip-toe, trembling, frightened at the noise
his feet made on the floor, his heart rent by a nameless agony. He
placed his ear to the breast of Athos, his face to the comte’s mouth.
Neither noise, nor breath! D’Artagnan drew back. Grimaud, who had
followed him with his eyes, and for whom each of his movements had been
a revelation, came timidly; seated himself at the foot of the bed, and
glued his lips to the sheet which was raised by the stiffened feet of
his master. Then large drops began to flow from his red eyes. This old
man in invincible despair, who wept, bent doubled without uttering a
word, presented the most touching spectacle that D’Artagnan, in a life
so filled with emotion, had ever met with.

The captain resumed standing in contemplation before that smiling dead
man, who seemed to have burnished his last thought, to give his best
friend, the man he had loved next to Raoul, a gracious welcome even
beyond life. And for reply to that exalted flattery of hospitality,
D’Artagnan went and kissed Athos fervently on the brow, and with his
trembling fingers closed his eyes. Then he seated himself by the pillow
without dread of that dead man, who had been so kind and affectionate
to him for five and thirty years. He was feeding his soul with the
remembrances the noble visage of the comte brought to his mind in
crowds--some blooming and charming as that smile--some dark, dismal, and
icy as that visage with its eyes now closed to all eternity.

All at once the bitter flood which mounted from minute to minute invaded
his heart, and swelled his breast almost to bursting. Incapable of
mastering his emotion, he arose, and tearing himself violently from the
chamber where he had just found dead him to whom he came to report the
news of the death of Porthos, he uttered sobs so heart-rending that the
servants, who seemed only to wait for an explosion of grief, answered to
it by their lugubrious clamors, and the dogs of the late comte by their
lamentable howlings. Grimaud was the only one who did not lift up his
voice. Even in the paroxysm of his grief he would not have dared to
profane the dead, or for the first time disturb the slumber of his
master. Had not Athos always bidden him be dumb?

At daybreak D’Artagnan, who had wandered about the lower hall, biting
his fingers to stifle his sighs--D’Artagnan went up once more; and
watching the moments when Grimaud turned his head towards him, he made
him a sign to come to him, which the faithful servant obeyed without
making more noise than a shadow. D’Artagnan went down again, followed
by Grimaud; and when he had gained the vestibule, taking the old man’s
hands, “Grimaud,” said he, “I have seen how the father died; now let me
know about the son.”

Grimaud drew from his breast a large letter, upon the envelope of which
was traced the address of Athos. He recognized the writing of M. de
Beaufort, broke the seal, and began to read, while walking about in the
first steel-chill rays of dawn, in the dark alley of old limes, marked
by the still visible footsteps of the comte who had just died.



Chapter LIX. The Bulletin.

The Duc de Beaufort wrote to Athos. The letter destined for the living
only reached the dead. God had changed the address.

“MY DEAR COMTE,” wrote the prince, in his large, school-boy’s hand,--“a
great misfortune has struck us amidst a great triumph. The king
loses one of the bravest of soldiers. I lose a friend. You lose M. de
Bragelonne. He has died gloriously, so gloriously that I have not the
strength to weep as I could wish. Receive my sad compliments, my dear
comte. Heaven distributes trials according to the greatness of our
hearts. This is an immense one, but not above your courage. Your good
friend,

“LE DUC DE BEAUFORT.”


The letter contained a relation written by one of the prince’s
secretaries. It was the most touching recital, and the most true,
of that dismal episode which unraveled two existences. D’Artagnan,
accustomed to battle emotions, and with a heart armed against
tenderness, could not help starting on reading the name of Raoul, the
name of that beloved boy who had become a shade now--like his father.

“In the morning,” said the prince’s secretary, “monseigneur commanded
the attack. Normandy and Picardy had taken positions in the rocks
dominated by the heights of the mountain, upon the declivity of which
were raised the bastions of Gigelli.

“The cannon opened the action; the regiments marched full of resolution;
the pikemen with pikes elevated, the musket-bearers with their weapons
ready. The prince followed attentively the march and movements of the
troops, so as to be able to sustain them with a strong reserve. With
monseigneur were the oldest captains and his aides-de-camp. M. le
Vicomte de Bragelonne had received orders not to leave his highness. In
the meantime the enemy’s cannon, which at first thundered with little
success against the masses, began to regulate their fire, and the balls,
better directed, killed several men near the prince. The regiments
formed in column, and, advancing against the ramparts, were rather
roughly handled. There was a sort of hesitation in our troops, who found
themselves ill-seconded by the artillery. In fact, the batteries which
had been established the evening before had but a weak and uncertain
aim, on account of their position. The upward direction of the aim
lessened the justness of the shots as well as their range.

“Monseigneur, comprehending the bad effect of this position on the siege
artillery, commanded the frigates moored in the little road to commence
a regular fire against the place. M. de Bragelonne offered himself at
once to carry this order. But monseigneur refused to acquiesce in the
vicomte’s request. Monseigneur was right, for he loved and wished to
spare the young nobleman. He was quite right, and the event took upon
itself to justify his foresight and refusal; for scarcely had the
sergeant charged with the message solicited by M. de Bragelonne gained
the seashore, when two shots from long carbines issued from the enemy’s
ranks and laid him low. The sergeant fell, dyeing the sand with his
blood; observing which, M. de Bragelonne smiled at monseigneur, who said
to him, ‘You see, vicomte, I have saved your life. Report that, some
day, to M. le Comte de la Fere, in order that, learning it from you, he
may thank me.’ The young nobleman smiled sadly, and replied to the duke,
‘It is true, monseigneur, that but for your kindness I should have been
killed, where the poor sergeant has fallen, and should be at rest.’ M.
de Bragelonne made this reply in such a tone that monseigneur answered
him warmly, ‘_Vrai Dieu!_ Young man, one would say that your mouth
waters for death; but, by the soul of Henry IV., I have promised your
father to bring you back alive; and, please the Lord, I mean to keep my
word.’

“Monseigneur de Bragelonne colored, and replied, in a lower voice,
‘Monseigneur, pardon me, I beseech you. I have always had a desire
to meet good opportunities; and it is so delightful to distinguish
ourselves before our general, particularly when that general is M. le
Duc de Beaufort.’

“Monseigneur was a little softened by this; and, turning to the officers
who surrounded him, gave different orders. The grenadiers of the two
regiments got near enough to the ditches and intrenchments to launch
their grenades, which had but small effect. In the meanwhile, M.
d’Estrees, who commanded the fleet, having seen the attempt of the
sergeant to approach the vessels, understood that he must act without
orders, and opened fire. Then the Arabs, finding themselves seriously
injured by the balls from the fleet, and beholding the destruction and
the ruin of their walls, uttered the most fearful cries. Their horsemen
descended the mountain at a gallop, bent over their saddles, and rushed
full tilt upon the columns of infantry, which, crossing their pikes,
stopped this mad assault. Repulsed by the firm attitude of the
battalion, the Arabs threw themselves with fury towards the
_etat-major_, which was not on its guard at that moment.

“The danger was great; monseigneur drew his sword; his secretaries and
people imitated him; the officers of the suite engaged in combat with
the furious Arabs. It was then M. de Bragelonne was able to satisfy the
inclination he had so clearly shown from the commencement of the action.
He fought near the prince with the valor of a Roman, and killed three
Arabs with his small sword. But it was evident that his bravery did not
arise from that sentiment of pride so natural to all who fight. It was
impetuous, affected, even forced; he sought to glut, intoxicate himself
with strife and carnage. He excited himself to such a degree that
monseigneur called to him to stop. He must have heard the voice of
monseigneur, because we who were close to him heard it. He did not,
however, stop, but continued his course to the intrenchments. As M.
de Bragelonne was a well-disciplined officer, this disobedience to the
orders of monseigneur very much surprised everybody, and M. de Beaufort
redoubled his earnestness, crying, ‘Stop, Bragelonne! Where are you
going? Stop,’ repeated monseigneur, ‘I command you!’

“We all, imitating the gesture of M. le duc, we all raised our hands.
We expected that the cavalier would turn bridle; but M. de Bragelonne
continued to ride towards the palisades.

“‘Stop, Bragelonne!’ repeated the prince, in a very loud voice, ‘stop!
in the name of your father!’

“At these words M. de Bragelonne turned round; his countenance expressed
a lively grief, but he did not stop; we then concluded that his horse
must have run away with him. When M. le duc saw cause to conclude that
the vicomte was no longer master of his horse, and had watched him
precede the first grenadiers, his highness cried, ‘Musketeers, kill
his horse! A hundred pistoles for the man who kills his horse!’ But who
could expect to hit the beast without at least wounding his rider?
No one dared the attempt. At length one presented himself; he was a
sharp-shooter of the regiment of Picardy, named Luzerne, who took aim
at the animal, fired, and hit him in the quarters, for we saw the blood
redden the hair of the horse. Instead of falling, the cursed jennet was
irritated, and carried him on more furiously than ever. Every Picard who
saw this unfortunate young man rushing on to meet certain death,
shouted in the loudest manner, ‘Throw yourself off, monsieur le
vicomte!--off!--off! throw yourself off!’ M. de Bragelonne was an
officer much beloved in the army. Already had the vicomte arrived within
pistol-shot of the ramparts, when a discharge was poured upon him
that enshrouded him in fire and smoke. We lost sight of him; the smoke
dispersed; he was on foot, upright; his horse was killed.

“The vicomte was summoned to surrender by the Arabs, but he made them
a negative sign with his head, and continued to march towards the
palisades. This was a mortal imprudence. Nevertheless the entire army
was pleased that he would not retreat, since ill-chance had led him
so near. He marched a few paces further, and the two regiments clapped
their hands. It was at this moment the second discharge shook the walls,
and the Vicomte de Bragelonne again disappeared in the smoke; but this
time the smoke dispersed in vain; we no longer saw him standing. He was
down, with his head lower than his legs, among the bushes, and the Arabs
began to think of leaving their intrenchments to come and cut off
his head or take his body--as is the custom with the infidels. But
Monseigneur le Duc de Beaufort had followed all this with his eyes, and
the sad spectacle drew from him many painful sighs. He then cried aloud,
seeing the Arabs running like white phantoms among the mastic-trees,
‘Grenadiers! lancers! will you let them take that noble body?’

“Saying these words and waving his sword, he himself rode towards the
enemy. The regiments, rushing in his steps, ran in their turn, uttering
cries as terrible as those of the Arabs were wild.

“The combat commenced over the body of M. de Bragelonne, and with such
inveteracy was it fought that a hundred and sixty Arabs were left
upon the field, by the side of at least fifty of our troops. It was
a lieutenant from Normandy who took the body of the vicomte on his
shoulders and carried it back to the lines. The advantage was, however,
pursued, the regiments took the reserve with them, and the enemy’s
palisades were utterly destroyed. At three o’clock the fire of the Arabs
ceased; the hand-to-hand fight lasted two hours; it was a massacre. At
five o’clock we were victorious at all points; the enemy had abandoned
his positions, and M. le duc ordered the white flag to be planted on the
summit of the little mountain. It was then we had time to think of M. de
Bragelonne, who had eight large wounds in his body, through which almost
all his blood had welled away. Still, however, he had breathed, which
afforded inexpressible joy to monseigneur, who insisted on being
present at the first dressing of the wounds and the consultation of the
surgeons. There were two among them who declared M. de Bragelonne would
live. Monseigneur threw his arms around their necks, and promised them a
thousand louis each if they could save him.

“The vicomte heard these transports of joy, and whether he was in
despair, or whether he suffered much from his wounds, he expressed
by his countenance a contradiction, which gave rise to reflection,
particularly in one of the secretaries when he had heard what follows.
The third surgeon was the brother of Sylvain de Saint-Cosme, the most
learned of them all. He probed the wounds in his turn, and said nothing.
M. de Bragelonne fixed his eyes steadily upon the skillful surgeon,
and seemed to interrogate his every movement. The latter, upon being
questioned by monseigneur, replied that he saw plainly three mortal
wounds out of eight, but so strong was the constitution of the wounded,
so rich was he in youth, and so merciful was the goodness of God, that
perhaps M. de Bragelonne might recover, particularly if he did not
move in the slightest manner. Frere Sylvain added, turning towards his
assistants, ‘Above everything, do not allow him to move, even a finger,
or you will kill him;’ and we all left the tent in very low spirits.
That secretary I have mentioned, on leaving the tent, thought he
perceived a faint and sad smile glide over the lips of M. de Bragelonne
when the duke said to him, in a cheerful, kind voice, ‘We will save you,
vicomte, we will save you yet.’

“In the evening, when it was believed the wounded youth had taken some
repose, one of the assistants entered his tent, but rushed out again
immediately, uttering loud cries. We all ran up in disorder, M. le duc
with us, and the assistant pointed to the body of M. de Bragelonne
upon the ground, at the foot of his bed, bathed in the remainder of his
blood. It appeared that he had suffered some convulsion, some delirium,
and that he had fallen; that the fall had accelerated his end, according
to the prognosis of Frere Sylvain. We raised the vicomte; he was cold
and dead. He held a lock of fair hair in his right hand, and that hand
was tightly pressed upon his heart.”

Then followed the details of the expedition, and of the victory obtained
over the Arabs. D’Artagnan stopped at the account of the death of poor
Raoul. “Oh!” murmured he, “unhappy boy! a suicide!” And turning his
eyes towards the chamber of the chateau, in which Athos slept in eternal
sleep, “They kept their words with each other,” said he, in a low voice;
“now I believe them to be happy; they must be reunited.” And he
returned through the parterre with slow and melancholy steps. All the
village--all the neighborhood--were filled with grieving neighbors
relating to each other the double catastrophe, and making preparations
for the funeral.



Chapter LX. The Last Canto of the Poem.

On the morrow, all the _noblesse_ of the provinces, of the environs, and
wherever messengers had carried the news, might have been seen arriving
in detachments. D’Artagnan had shut himself up, without being willing
to speak to anybody. Two such heavy deaths falling upon the captain,
so closely after the death of Porthos, for a long time oppressed that
spirit which had hitherto been so indefatigable and invulnerable.
Except Grimaud, who entered his chamber once, the musketeer saw neither
servants nor guests. He supposed, from the noises in the house, and the
continual coming and going, that preparations were being made for the
funeral of the comte. He wrote to the king to ask for an extension of
his leave of absence. Grimaud, as we have said, had entered D’Artagnan’s
apartment, had seated himself upon a joint-stool near the door, like a
man who meditates profoundly; then, rising, he made a sign to D’Artagnan
to follow him. The latter obeyed in silence. Grimaud descended to the
comte’s bed-chamber, showed the captain with his finger the place of the
empty bed, and raised his eyes eloquently towards Heaven.

“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan, “yes, good Grimaud--now with the son he loved
so much!”

Grimaud left the chamber, and led the way to the hall, where, according
to the custom of the province, the body was laid out, previously to
being put away forever. D’Artagnan was struck at seeing two open coffins
in the hall. In reply to the mute invitation of Grimaud, he approached,
and saw in one of them Athos, still handsome in death, and, in the
other, Raoul with his eyes closed, his cheeks pearly as those of the
Palls of Virgil, with a smile on his violet lips. He shuddered at seeing
the father and son, those two departed souls, represented on earth by
two silent, melancholy bodies, incapable of touching each other, however
close they might be.

“Raoul here!” murmured he. “Oh! Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?”

Grimaud shook his head, and made no reply; but taking D’Artagnan by
the hand, he led him to the coffin, and showed him, under the thin
winding-sheet, the black wounds by which life had escaped. The captain
turned away his eyes, and, judging it was useless to question Grimaud,
who would not answer, he recollected that M. de Beaufort’s secretary had
written more than he, D’Artagnan, had had the courage to read. Taking up
the recital of the affair which had cost Raoul his life, he found these
words, which ended the concluding paragraph of the letter:

“Monseigneur le duc has ordered that the body of monsieur le vicomte
should be embalmed, after the manner practiced by the Arabs when they
wish their dead to be carried to their native land; and monsieur le duc
has appointed relays, so that the same confidential servant who brought
up the young man might take back his remains to M. le Comte de la Fere.”

“And so,” thought D’Artagnan, “I shall follow thy funeral, my dear
boy--I, already old--I, who am of no value on earth--and I shall scatter
dust upon that brow I kissed but two months since. God has willed it to
be so. Thou hast willed it to be so, thyself. I have no longer the right
even to weep. Thou hast chosen death; it seemed to thee a preferable
gift to life.”

At length arrived the moment when the chill remains of these two
gentlemen were to be given back to mother earth. There was such an
affluence of military and other people that up to the place of the
sepulture, which was a little chapel on the plain, the road from the
city was filled with horsemen and pedestrians in mourning. Athos had
chosen for his resting-place the little inclosure of a chapel erected by
himself near the boundary of his estates. He had had the stones, cut
in 1550, brought from an old Gothic manor-house in Berry, which had
sheltered his early youth. The chapel, thus rebuilt, transported, was
pleasing to the eye beneath its leafy curtains of poplars and sycamores.
It was ministered in every Sunday, by the cure of the neighboring bourg,
to whom Athos paid an allowance of two hundred francs for this service;
and all the vassals of his domain, with their families, came thither to
hear mass, without having any occasion to go to the city.

Behind the chapel extended, surrounded by two high hedges of
hazel, elder and white thorn, and a deep ditch, the little
inclosure--uncultivated, though gay in its sterility; because the mosses
there grew thick, wild heliotrope and ravenelles there mingled perfumes,
while from beneath an ancient chestnut issued a crystal spring, a
prisoner in its marble cistern, and on the thyme all around alighted
thousands of bees from the neighboring plants, whilst chaffinches and
redthroats sang cheerfully among the flower-spangled hedges. It was to
this place the somber coffins were carried, attended by a silent and
respectful crowd. The office of the dead being celebrated, the last
adieux paid to the noble departed, the assembly dispersed, talking,
along the roads, of the virtues and mild death of the father, of the
hopes the son had given, and of his melancholy end upon the arid coast
of Africa.

Little by little, all noises were extinguished, like the lamps
illuminating the humble nave. The minister bowed for the last time to
the altar and the still fresh graves; then, followed by his assistant,
he slowly took the road back to the presbytery. D’Artagnan, left alone,
perceived that night was coming on. He had forgotten the hour, thinking
only of the dead. He arose from the oaken bench on which he was seated
in the chapel, and wished, as the priest had done, to go and bid a last
adieu to the double grave which contained his two lost friends.

A woman was praying, kneeling on the moist earth. D’Artagnan stopped at
the door of the chapel, to avoid disturbing her, and also to endeavor to
find out who was the pious friend who performed this sacred duty with
so much zeal and perseverance. The unknown had hidden her face in her
hands, which were white as alabaster. From the noble simplicity of her
costume, she must be a woman of distinction. Outside the inclosure were
several horses mounted by servants; a travelling carriage was in waiting
for this lady. D’Artagnan in vain sought to make out what caused her
delay. She continued praying, and frequently pressed her handkerchief to
her face, by which D’Artagnan perceived she was weeping. He beheld her
strike her breast with the compunction of a Christian woman. He heard
her several times exclaim as from a wounded heart: “Pardon! pardon!” And
as she appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief, as she threw
herself down, almost fainting, exhausted by complaints and prayers,
D’Artagnan, touched by this love for his so much regretted friends,
made a few steps towards the grave, in order to interrupt the melancholy
colloquy of the penitent with the dead. But as soon as his step sounded
on the gravel, the unknown raised her head, revealing to D’Artagnan a
face aflood with tears, a well-known face. It was Mademoiselle de la
Valliere! “Monsieur d’Artagnan!” murmured she.

“You!” replied the captain, in a stern voice, “you here!--oh! madame, I
should better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion
of the Comte de la Fere. You would have wept less--and they too--and I!”

“Monsieur!” said she, sobbing.

“For it was you,” added this pitiless friend of the dead,--“it was you
who sped these two men to the grave.”

“Oh! spare me!”

“God forbid, madame, that I should offend a woman, or that I should make
her weep in vain; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not
upon the grave of her victims.” She wished to reply.

“What I now tell you,” added he, coldly, “I have already told the king.”

She clasped her hands. “I know,” said she, “I have caused the death of
the Vicomte de Bragelonne.”

“Ah! you know it?”

“The news arrived at court yesterday. I have traveled during the night
forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte, whom I supposed to be
still living, and to pray God, on the tomb of Raoul, that he would
send me all the misfortunes I have merited, except a single one. Now,
monsieur, I know that the death of the son has killed the father; I have
two crimes to reproach myself with; I have two punishments to expect
from Heaven.”

“I will repeat to you, mademoiselle,” said D’Artagnan, “what M. de
Bragelonne said of you, at Antibes, when he already meditated death: ‘If
pride and coquetry have misled her, I pardon her while despising her. If
love has produced her error, I pardon her, but I swear that no one could
have loved her as I have done.’”

“You know,” interrupted Louise, “that of my love I was about to
sacrifice myself; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost,
dying, abandoned. Well! never have I suffered so much as now; because
then I hoped, desired,--now I have no longer anything to wish for;
because this death drags all my joy into the tomb; because I can no
longer dare to love without remorse, and I feel that he whom I love--oh!
it is but just!--will repay me with the tortures I have made others
undergo.”

D’Artagnan made no reply; he was too well convinced that she was not
mistaken.

“Well, then,” added she, “dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, do not overwhelm me
to-day, I again implore you! I am like the branch torn from the trunk, I
no longer hold to anything in this world--a current drags me on, I
know not whither. I love madly, even to the point of coming to tell it,
wretch that I am, over the ashes of the dead, and I do not blush for
it--I have no remorse on this account. Such love is a religion. Only, as
hereafter you will see me alone, forgotten, disdained; as you will see
me punished, as I am destined to be punished, spare me in my ephemeral
happiness, leave it to me for a few days, for a few minutes. Now, even
at the moment I am speaking to you, perhaps it no longer exists. My God!
this double murder is perhaps already expiated!”

While she was speaking thus, the sound of voices and of horses drew the
attention of the captain. M. de Saint-Aignan came to seek La
Valliere. “The king,” he said, “is a prey to jealousy and uneasiness.”
 Saint-Aignan did not perceive D’Artagnan, half concealed by the trunk
of a chestnut-tree which shaded the double grave. Louise thanked
Saint-Aignan, and dismissed him with a gesture. He rejoined the party
outside the inclosure.

“You see, madame,” said the captain bitterly to the young woman,--“you
see your happiness still lasts.”

The young woman raised her head with a solemn air. “A day will come,”
 said she, “when you will repent of having so misjudged me. On that day,
it is I who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards
me. Besides, I shall suffer so much that you yourself will be the first
to pity my sufferings. Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness,
Monsieur d’Artagnan; it costs me dear, and I have not paid all my debt.”
 Saying these words, she again knelt down, softly and affectionately.

“Pardon me the last time, my affianced Raoul!” said she. “I have
broken our chain; we are both destined to die of grief. It is thou who
departest first; fear nothing, I shall follow thee. See, only, that I
have not been base, and that I have come to bid thee this last adieu.
The Lord is my witness, Raoul, that if with my life I could have
redeemed thine, I would have given that life without hesitation. I could
not give my love. Once more, forgive me, dearest, kindest friend.”

She strewed a few sweet flowers on the freshly sodded earth; then,
wiping the tears from her eyes, the heavily stricken lady bowed to
D’Artagnan, and disappeared.

The captain watched the departure of the horses, horsemen, and carriage,
then crossing his arms upon his swelling chest, “When will it be my turn
to depart?” said he, in an agitated voice. “What is there left for
man after youth, love, glory, friendship, strength, and wealth have
disappeared? That rock, under which sleeps Porthos, who possessed all I
have named; this moss, under which repose Athos and Raoul, who possessed
much more!”

He hesitated for a moment, with a dull eye; then, drawing himself up,
“Forward! still forward!” said he. “When it is time, God will tell me,
as he foretold the others.”

He touched the earth, moistened with the evening dew, with the ends
of his fingers, signed himself as if he had been at the _benitier_ in
church, and retook alone--ever alone--the road to Paris.


Epilogue.

Four years after the scene we have just described, two horsemen, well
mounted, traversed Blois early in the morning, for the purpose of
arranging a hawking party the king had arranged to make in that uneven
plain the Loire divides in two, which borders on the one side Meung, on
the other Amboise. These were the keeper of the king’s harriers and the
master of the falcons, personages greatly respected in the time of
Louis XIII., but rather neglected by his successor. The horsemen, having
reconnoitered the ground, were returning, their observations made, when
they perceived certain little groups of soldiers, here and there,
whom the sergeants were placing at distances at the openings of the
inclosures. These were the king’s musketeers. Behind them came, upon a
splendid horse, the captain, known by his richly embroidered uniform.
His hair was gray, his beard turning so. He seemed a little bent,
although sitting and handling his horse gracefully. He was looking about
him watchfully.

“M. d’Artagnan does not get any older,” said the keeper of the harriers
to his colleague the falconer; “with ten years more to carry than either
of us, he has the seat of a young man on horseback.”

“That is true,” replied the falconer. “I don’t see any change in him for
the last twenty years.”

But this officer was mistaken; D’Artagnan in the last four years had
lived a dozen. Age had printed its pitiless claws at each angle of his
eyes; his brow was bald; his hands, formerly brown and nervous, were
getting white, as if the blood had half forgotten them.

D’Artagnan accosted the officers with the shade of affability which
distinguishes superiors, and received in turn for his courtesy two most
respectful bows.

“Ah! what a lucky chance to see you here, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried
the falconer.

“It is rather I who should say that, messieurs,” replied the captain,
“for nowadays, the king makes more frequent use of his musketeers than
of his falcons.”

“Ah! it is not as it was in the good old times,” sighed the falconer.
“Do you remember, Monsieur d’Artagnan, when the late king flew the pie
in the vineyards beyond Beaugence? Ah! _dame!_ you were not the captain
of the musketeers at that time, Monsieur d’Artagnan.” [7]

“And you were nothing but under-corporal of the tiercelets,” replied
D’Artagnan, laughing. “Never mind that, it was a good time, seeing
that it is always a good time when we are young. Good day, monsieur the
keeper of the harriers.”

“You do me honor, monsieur le comte,” said the latter. D’Artagnan made
no reply. The title of comte had hardly struck him; D’Artagnan had been
a comte four years.

“Are you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken,
monsieur le capitaine?” continued the falconer. “It must be full two
hundred leagues from hence to Pignerol.”

“Two hundred and sixty to go, and as many to return,” said D’Artagnan,
quietly.

“And,” said the falconer, “is _he_ well?”

“Who?” asked D’Artagnan.

“Why, poor M. Fouquet,” continued the falconer, in a low voice. The
keeper of the harriers had prudently withdrawn.

“No,” replied D’Artagnan, “the poor man frets terribly; he cannot
comprehend how imprisonment can be a favor; he says that parliament
absolved him by banishing him, and banishment is, or should be, liberty.
He cannot imagine that they had sworn his death, and that to save his
life from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to
Heaven.”

“Ah! yes; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold,” replied the
falconer; “it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor
of the Bastile, and that the execution was ordered.”

“Enough!” said D’Artagnan, pensively, and with a view of cutting short
the conversation.

“Yes,” said the keeper of the harriers, drawing towards them, “M.
Fouquet is now at Pignerol; he has richly deserved it. He had the good
fortune to be conducted there by you; he robbed the king sufficiently.”

D’Artagnan launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks,
and said to him, “Monsieur, if any one told me you had eaten your dogs’
meat, not only would I refuse to believe it; but still more, if you were
condemned to the lash or to jail for it, I should pity you and would not
allow people to speak ill of you. And yet, monsieur, honest man as you
may be, I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet was.”

After having undergone this sharp rebuke, the keeper of the harriers
hung his head, and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of
him nearer to D’Artagnan.

“He is content,” said the falconer, in a low voice, to the musketeer;
“we all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays; if he were a
falconer he would not talk in that way.”

D’Artagnan smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political
question resolved by the discontent of such humble interest. He for a
moment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the surintendant,
the crumbling of his fortunes, and the melancholy death that awaited
him; and to conclude, “Did M. Fouquet love falconry?” said he.

“Oh, passionately, monsieur!” repeated the falconer, with an accent of
bitter regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet.

D’Artagnan allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other
to pass, and continued to advance. They could already catch glimpses
of the huntsmen at the issue of the wood, the feathers of the outriders
passing like shooting stars across the clearings, and the white horses
skirting the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions.

“But,” resumed D’Artagnan, “will the sport last long? Pray, give us a
good swift bird, for I am very tired. Is it a heron or a swan?”

“Both, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the falconer; “but you need not be
alarmed; the king is not much of a sportsman; he does not take the field
on his own account, he only wishes to amuse the ladies.”

The words “to amuse the ladies” were so strongly accented they set
D’Artagnan thinking.

“Ah!” said he, looking keenly at the falconer.

The keeper of the harriers smiled, no doubt with a view of making it up
with the musketeer.

“Oh! you may safely laugh,” said D’Artagnan; “I know nothing of current
news; I only arrived yesterday, after a month’s absence. I left the
court mourning the death of the queen-mother. The king was not willing
to take any amusement after receiving the last sigh of Anne of Austria;
but everything comes to an end in this world. Well! then he is no longer
sad? So much the better.” [8]

“And everything begins as well as ends,” said the keeper with a coarse
laugh.

“Ah!” said D’Artagnan, a second time,--he burned to know, but dignity
would not allow him to interrogate people below him,--“there is
something beginning, then, it seems?”

The keeper gave him a significant wink; but D’Artagnan was unwilling to
learn anything from this man.

“Shall we see the king early?” asked he of the falconer.

“At seven o’clock, monsieur, I shall fly the birds.”

“Who comes with the king? How is Madame? How is the queen?”

“Better, monsieur.”

“Has she been ill, then?”

“Monsieur, since the last chagrin she suffered, her majesty has been
unwell.”

“What chagrin? You need not fancy your news is old. I have but just
returned.”

“It appears that the queen, a little neglected since the death of her
mother-in-law, complained to the king, who answered her,--‘Do I not
sleep at home every night, madame? What more do you expect?’”

“Ah!” said D’Artagnan,--“poor woman! She must heartily hate Mademoiselle
de la Valliere.”

“Oh, no! not Mademoiselle de la Valliere,” replied the falconer.

“Who then--” The blast of a hunting-horn interrupted this conversation.
It summoned the dogs and the hawks. The falconer and his companions set
off immediately, leaving D’Artagnan alone in the midst of the suspended
sentence. The king appeared at a distance, surrounded by ladies and
horsemen. All the troop advanced in beautiful order, at a foot’s pace,
the horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses. There was an
animation in the scene, a mirage of light, of which nothing now can give
an idea, unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric spectacle.
D’Artagnan, with an eye a little, just a little, dimmed by age,
distinguished behind the group three carriages. The first was intended
for the queen; it was empty. D’Artagnan, who did not see Mademoiselle de
la Valliere by the king’s side, on looking about for her, saw her in the
second carriage. She was alone with two of her women, who seemed as dull
as their mistress. On the left hand of the king, upon a high-spirited
horse, restrained by a bold and skillful hand, shone a lady of most
dazzling beauty. The king smiled upon her, and she smiled upon the king.
Loud laughter followed every word she uttered.


“I must know that woman,” thought the musketeer; “who can she be?” And
he stooped towards his friend, the falconer, to whom he addressed the
question he had put to himself.

The falconer was about to reply, when the king, perceiving D’Artagnan,
“Ah, comte!” said he, “you are amongst us once more then! Why have I not
seen you?”

“Sire,” replied the captain, “because your majesty was asleep when I
arrived, and not awake when I resumed my duties this morning.”

“Still the same,” said Louis, in a loud voice, denoting satisfaction.
“Take some rest, comte; I command you to do so. You will dine with me
to-day.”

A murmur of admiration surrounded D’Artagnan like a caress. Every one
was eager to salute him. Dining with the king was an honor his majesty
was not so prodigal of as Henry IV. had been. The king passed a few
steps in advance, and D’Artagnan found himself in the midst of a fresh
group, among whom shone Colbert.

“Good-day, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the minister, with marked
affability, “have you had a pleasant journey?”

“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing to the neck of his horse.

“I heard the king invite you to his table for this evening,” continued
the minister; “you will meet an old friend there.”

“An old friend of mine?” asked D’Artagnan, plunging painfully into
the dark waves of the past, which had swallowed up for him so many
friendships and so many hatreds.

“M. le Duc d’Almeda, who is arrived this morning from Spain.”

“The Duc d’Almeda?” said D’Artagnan, reflecting in vain.

“Here!” cried an old man, white as snow, sitting bent in his carriage,
which he caused to be thrown open to make room for the musketeer.

“_Aramis!_” cried D’Artagnan, struck with profound amazement. And he
felt, inert as it was, the thin arm of the old nobleman hanging round
his neck.

Colbert, after having observed them in silence for a few moments, urged
his horse forward, and left the two old friends together.

“And so,” said the musketeer, taking Aramis’s arm, “you, the exile, the
rebel, are again in France?”

“Ah! and I shall dine with you at the king’s table,” said Aramis,
smiling. “Yes, will you not ask yourself what is the use of fidelity
in this world? Stop! let us allow poor La Valliere’s carriage to pass.
Look, how uneasy she is! How her eyes, dim with tears, follow the king,
who is riding on horseback yonder!”

“With whom?”

“With Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, now Madame de Montespan,” replied
Aramis.

“She is jealous. Is she then deserted?”

“Not quite yet, but it will not be long before she _is_.” [9]

They chatted together, while following the sport, and Aramis’s coachman
drove them so cleverly that they arrived at the instant when the falcon,
attacking the bird, beat him down, and fell upon him. The king alighted;
Madame de Montespan followed his example. They were in front of an
isolated chapel, concealed by huge trees, already despoiled of their
leaves by the first cutting winds of autumn. Behind this chapel was an
inclosure, closed by a latticed gate. The falcon had beaten down his
prey in the inclosure belonging to this little chapel, and the king was
desirous of going in to take the first feather, according to custom. The
_cortege_ formed a circle round the building and the hedges, too small
to receive so many. D’Artagnan held back Aramis by the arm, as he was
about, like the rest, to alight from his carriage, and in a hoarse,
broken voice, “Do you know, Aramis,” said he, “whither chance has
conducted us?”

“No,” replied the duke.

“Here repose men that we knew well,” said D’Artagnan, greatly agitated.

Aramis, without divining anything, and with a trembling step, penetrated
into the chapel by a little door which D’Artagnan opened for him. “Where
are they buried?” said he.

“There, in the inclosure. There is a cross, you see, beneath yon little
cypress. The tree of grief is planted over their tomb; don’t go to it;
the king is going that way; the heron has fallen just there.”

Aramis stopped, and concealed himself in the shade. They then saw,
without being seen, the pale face of La Valliere, who, neglected in her
carriage, at first looked on, with a melancholy heart, from the door,
and then, carried away by jealousy, advanced into the chapel, whence,
leaning against a pillar, she contemplated the king smiling and making
signs to Madame de Montespan to approach, as there was nothing to be
afraid of. Madame de Montespan complied; she took the hand the king held
out to her, and he, plucking out the first feather from the heron, which
the falconer had strangled, placed it in his beautiful companion’s hat.
She, smiling in her turn, kissed the hand tenderly which made her this
present. The king grew scarlet with vanity and pleasure; he looked at
Madame de Montespan with all the fire of new love.

“What will you give me in exchange?” said he.

She broke off a little branch of cypress and offered it to the king, who
looked intoxicated with hope.

“Humph!” said Aramis to D’Artagnan; “the present is but a sad one, for
that cypress shades a tomb.”

“Yes, and the tomb is that of Raoul de Bragelonne,” said D’Artagnan
aloud; “of Raoul, who sleeps under that cross with his father.”

A groan resounded--they saw a woman fall fainting to the ground.
Mademoiselle de la Valliere had seen all, heard all.

“Poor woman!” muttered D’Artagnan, as he helped the attendants to carry
back to her carriage the lonely lady whose lot henceforth in life was
suffering.

That evening D’Artagnan was seated at the king’s table, near M. Colbert
and M. le Duc d’Almeda. The king was very gay. He paid a thousand little
attentions to the queen, a thousand kindnesses to Madame, seated at his
left hand, and very sad. It might have been supposed that time of calm
when the king was wont to watch his mother’s eyes for the approval or
disapproval of what he had just done.

Of mistresses there was no question at this dinner. The king addressed
Aramis two or three times, calling him M. l’ambassadeur, which increased
the surprise already felt by D’Artagnan at seeing his friend the rebel
so marvelously well received at court.

The king, on rising from table, gave his hand to the queen, and made
a sign to Colbert, whose eye was on his master’s face. Colbert took
D’Artagnan and Aramis on one side. The king began to chat with his
sister, whilst Monsieur, very uneasy, entertained the queen with a
preoccupied air, without ceasing to watch his wife and brother from
the corner of his eye. The conversation between Aramis, D’Artagnan,
and Colbert turned upon indifferent subjects. They spoke of preceding
ministers; Colbert related the successful tricks of Mazarin, and desired
those of Richelieu to be related to him. D’Artagnan could not overcome
his surprise at finding this man, with his heavy eyebrows and low
forehead, display so much sound knowledge and cheerful spirits. Aramis
was astonished at that lightness of character which permitted this
serious man to retard with advantage the moment for more important
conversation, to which nobody made any allusion, although all
three interlocutors felt its imminence. It was very plain, from the
embarrassed appearance of Monsieur, how much the conversation of the
king and Madame annoyed him. Madame’s eyes were almost red: was she
going to complain? Was she going to expose a little scandal in open
court? The king took her on one side, and in a tone so tender that
it must have reminded the princess of the time when she was loved for
herself:

“Sister,” said he, “why do I see tears in those lovely eyes?”

“Why--sire--” said she.

“Monsieur is jealous, is he not, sister?”

She looked towards Monsieur, an infallible sign that they were talking
about him.

“Yes,” said she.

“Listen to me,” said the king; “if your friends compromise you, it is
not Monsieur’s fault.”

He spoke these words with so much kindness that Madame, encouraged,
having borne so many solitary griefs so long, was nearly bursting into
tears, so full was her heart.

“Come, come, dear little sister,” said the king, “tell me your griefs;
on the word of a brother, I pity them; on the word of a king, I will put
an end to them.”

She raised her glorious eyes and, in a melancholy tone:

“It is not my friends who compromise me,” said she; “they are either
absent or concealed; they have been brought into disgrace with your
majesty; they, so devoted, so good, so loyal!”

“You say this on account of De Guiche, whom I have exiled, at Monsieur’s
desire?”

“And who, since that unjust exile, has endeavored to get himself killed
once every day.”

“Unjust, say you, sister?”

“So unjust, that if I had not had the respect mixed with friendship that
I have always entertained for your majesty--”

“Well!”

“Well! I would have asked my brother Charles, upon whom I can always--”

The king started. “What, then?”

“I would have asked him to have had it represented to you that Monsieur
and his favorite M. le Chevalier de Lorraine ought not with impunity to
constitute themselves the executioners of my honor and my happiness.”

“The Chevalier de Lorraine,” said the king; “that dismal fellow?”

“Is my mortal enemy. Whilst that man lives in my household, where
Monsieur retains him and delegates his power to him, I shall be the most
miserable woman in the kingdom.”

“So,” said the king, slowly, “you call your brother of England a better
friend than I am?”

“Actions speak for themselves, sire.”

“And you would prefer going to ask assistance there--”

“To my own country!” said she with pride; “yes, sire.”

“You are the grandchild of Henry IV. as well as myself, lady. Cousin
and brother-in-law, does not that amount pretty well to the title of
brother-germain?”

“Then,” said Henrietta, “act!”

“Let us form an alliance.”

“Begin.”

“I have, you say, unjustly exiled De Guiche.”

“Oh! yes,” said she, blushing.

“De Guiche shall return.” [10]

“So far, well.”

“And now you say that I do wrong in having in your household the
Chevalier de Lorraine, who gives Monsieur ill advice respecting you?”

“Remember well what I tell you, sire; the Chevalier de Lorraine some
day--Observe, if ever I come to a dreadful end, I beforehand accuse the
Chevalier de Lorraine; he has a spirit that is capable of any crime!”

“The Chevalier de Lorraine shall no longer annoy you--I promise you
that.” [11]

“Then that will be a true preliminary of alliance, sire,--I sign; but
since you have done your part, tell me what shall be mine.”

“Instead of embroiling me with your brother Charles, you must make him a
more intimate friend than ever.”

“That is very easy.”

“Oh! not quite so easy as you may suppose, for in ordinary friendship
people embrace or exercise hospitality, and that only costs a kiss or a
return, profitable expenses; but in political friendship--”

“Ah! it’s a political friendship, is it?”

“Yes, my sister; and then, instead of embraces and feasts, it is
soldiers--it is soldiers all alive and well equipped--that we must serve
up to our friends; vessels we must offer, all armed with cannons and
stored with provisions. It hence results that we have not always coffers
in a fit condition for such friendships.”

“Ah! you are quite right,” said Madame; “the coffers of the king of
England have been sonorous for some time.”

“But you, my sister, who have so much influence over your brother, you
can secure more than an ambassador could ever get the promise of.”

“To effect that I must go to London, my dear brother.”

“I have thought so,” replied the king, eagerly; “and I have said to
myself that such a voyage would do your health and spirits good.”

“Only,” interrupted Madame, “it is possible I should fail. The king of
England has dangerous counselors.”

“Counselors, do you say?”

“Precisely. If, by chance, your majesty had any intention--I am only
supposing so--of asking Charles II. his alliance in a war--”

“A war?”

“Yes; well! then the king’s counselors, who are in number
seven--Mademoiselle Stewart, Mademoiselle Wells, Mademoiselle Gwyn,
Miss Orchay, Mademoiselle Zunga, Miss Davies, and the proud Countess of
Castlemaine--will represent to the king that war costs a great deal of
money; that it is better to give balls and suppers at Hampton Court than
to equip ships of the line at Portsmouth and Greenwich.”

“And then your negotiations will fail?”

“Oh! those ladies cause all negotiations to fall through which they
don’t make themselves.”

“Do you know the idea that has struck me, sister?”

“No; inform me what it is.”

“It is that, searching well around you, you might perhaps find a female
counselor to take with you to your brother, whose eloquence might
paralyze the ill-will of the seven others.”

“That is really an idea, sire, and I will search.”

“You will find what you want.”

“I hope so.”

“A pretty ambassadress is necessary; an agreeable face is better than an
ugly one, is it not?”

“Most assuredly.”

“An animated, lively, audacious character.”

“Certainly.”

“Nobility; that is, enough to enable her to approach the king without
awkwardness--not too lofty, so as not to trouble herself about the
dignity of her race.”

“Very true.”

“And who knows a little English.”

“_Mon Dieu!_ why, some one,” cried Madame, “like Mademoiselle de
Keroualle, for instance!”

“Oh! why, yes!” said Louis XIV.; “you have hit the mark,--it is you who
have found, my sister.”

“I will take her; she will have no cause to complain, I suppose.”

“Oh! no, I will name her _seductrice plenipotentiaire_ at once, and will
add a dowry to the title.”

“That is well.”

“I fancy you already on your road, my dear little sister, consoled for
all your griefs.”

“I will go, on two conditions. The first is, that I shall know what I am
negotiating about.”

“That is it. The Dutch, you know, insult me daily in their gazettes, and
by their republican attitude. I do not like republics.”

“That may easily be imagined, sire.”

“I see with pain that these kings of the sea--they call themselves
so--keep trade from France in the Indies, and that their vessels will
soon occupy all the ports of Europe. Such a power is too near me,
sister.”

“They are your allies, nevertheless.”

“That is why they were wrong in having the medal you have heard of
struck; a medal which represents Holland stopping the sun, as Joshua
did, with this legend: _The sun had stopped before me_. There is not
much fraternity in that, _is_ there?”

“I thought you had forgotten that miserable episode?”

“I never forget anything, sister. And if my true friends, such as your
brother Charles, are willing to second me--” The princess remained
pensively silent.

“Listen to me; there is the empire of the seas to be shared,” said
Louis XIV. “For this partition, which England submits to, could I not
represent the second party as well as the Dutch?”

“We have Mademoiselle de Keroualle to treat that question,” replied
Madame.

“Your second condition for going, if you please, sister?”

“The consent of Monsieur, my husband.”

“You shall have it.”

“Then consider me already gone, brother.”

On hearing these words, Louis XIV. turned round towards the corner of
the room in which D’Artagnan, Colbert, and Aramis stood, and made
an affirmative sign to his minister. Colbert then broke in on the
conversation suddenly, and said to Aramis:

“Monsieur l’ambassadeur, shall we talk about business?”

D’Artagnan immediately withdrew, from politeness. He directed his steps
towards the fireplace, within hearing of what the king was about to say
to Monsieur, who, evidently uneasy, had gone to him. The face of the
king was animated. Upon his brow was stamped a strength of will, the
expression of which already met no further contradiction in France, and
was soon to meet no more in Europe.

“Monsieur,” said the king to his brother, “I am not pleased with M. le
Chevalier de Lorraine. You, who do him the honor to protect him, must
advise him to travel for a few months.”

These words fell with the crush of an avalanche upon Monsieur, who
adored his favorite, and concentrated all his affections in him.

“In what has the chevalier been inconsiderate enough to displease your
majesty?” cried he, darting a furious look at Madame.

“I will tell you that when he is gone,” said the king, suavely. “And
also when Madame, here, shall have crossed over into England.”

“Madame! in England!” murmured Monsieur, in amazement.

“In a week, brother,” continued the king, “whilst we will go whither I
will shortly tell you.” And the king turned on his heel, smiling in his
brother’s face, to sweeten, as it were, the bitter draught he had given
him.

During this time Colbert was talking with the Duc d’Almeda.

“Monsieur,” said Colbert to Aramis, “this is the moment for us to come
to an understanding. I have made your peace with the king, and I owed
that clearly to a man of so much merit; but as you have often expressed
friendship for me, an opportunity presents itself for giving me a proof
of it. You are, besides, more a Frenchman than a Spaniard. Shall we
secure--answer me frankly--the neutrality of Spain, if we undertake
anything against the United Provinces?”

“Monsieur,” replied Aramis, “the interest of Spain is clear. To embroil
Europe with the Provinces would doubtless be our policy, but the king
of France is an ally of the United Provinces. You are not ignorant,
besides, that it would infer a maritime war, and that France is in no
state to undertake this with advantage.”

Colbert, turning round at this moment, saw D’Artagnan who was seeking
some interlocutor, during this “aside” of the king and Monsieur. He
called him, at the same time saying in a low voice to Aramis, “We may
talk openly with D’Artagnan, I suppose?”

“Oh! certainly,” replied the ambassador.

“We were saying, M. d’Almeda and I,” said Colbert, “that a conflict with
the United Provinces would mean a maritime war.”

“That’s evident enough,” replied the musketeer.

“And what do you think of it, Monsieur d’Artagnan?”

“I think that to carry on such a war successfully, you must have very
large land forces.”

“What did you say?” said Colbert, thinking he had ill understood him.

“Why such a large land army?” said Aramis.

“Because the king will be beaten by sea if he has not the English with
him, and that when beaten by sea, he will soon be invaded, either by the
Dutch in his ports, or by the Spaniards by land.”

“And Spain neutral?” asked Aramis.

“Neutral as long as the king shall prove stronger,” rejoined D’Artagnan.

Colbert admired that sagacity which never touched a question without
enlightening it thoroughly. Aramis smiled, as he had long known that in
diplomacy D’Artagnan acknowledged no superior. Colbert, who, like all
proud men, dwelt upon his fantasy with a certainty of success, resumed
the subject, “Who told you, M. d’Artagnan, that the king had no navy?”

“Oh! I take no heed of these details,” replied the captain. “I am but an
indifferent sailor. Like all nervous people, I hate the sea; and yet I
have an idea that, with ships, France being a seaport with two hundred
exits, we might have sailors.”

Colbert drew from his pocket a little oblong book divided into two
columns. On the first were the names of vessels, on the other the
figures recapitulating the number of cannon and men requisite to equip
these ships. “I have had the same idea as you,” said he to
D’Artagnan, “and I have had an account drawn up of the vessels we have
altogether--thirty-five ships.”

“Thirty-five ships! impossible!” cried D’Artagnan.

“Something like two thousand pieces of cannon,” said Colbert. “That is
what the king possesses at this moment. Of five and thirty vessels we
can make three squadrons, but I must have five.”

“Five!” cried Aramis.

“They will be afloat before the end of the year, gentlemen; the king
will have fifty ship of the line. We may venture on a contest with them,
may we not?”

“To build vessels,” said D’Artagnan, “is difficult, but possible. As
to arming them, how is that to be done? In France there are neither
foundries nor military docks.”

“Bah!” replied Colbert, in a bantering tone, “I have planned all
that this year and a half past, did you not know it? Do you know M.
d’Imfreville?”

“D’Imfreville?” replied D’Artagnan; “no.”

“He is a man I have discovered; he has a specialty; he is a man of
genius--he knows how to set men to work. It is he who has cast cannon
and cut the woods of Bourgogne. And then, monsieur l’ambassadeur, you
may not believe what I am going to tell you, but I have a still further
idea.”

“Oh, monsieur!” said Aramis, civilly, “I always believe you.”

“Calculating upon the character of the Dutch, our allies, I said to
myself, ‘They are merchants, they are friendly with the king; they will
be happy to sell to the king what they fabricate for themselves; then
the more we buy’--Ah! I must add this: I have Forant--do you know
Forant, D’Artagnan?”

Colbert, in his warmth, forgot himself; he called the captain simply
_D’Artagnan_, as the king did. But the captain only smiled at it.

“No,” replied he, “I do not know him.”

“That is another man I have discovered, with a genius for buying. This
Forant has purchased for me 350,000 pounds of iron in balls, 200,000
pounds of powder, twelve cargoes of Northern timber, matches, grenades,
pitch, tar--I know not what! with a saving of seven per cent upon what
all those articles would cost me fabricated in France.”

“That is a capital and quaint idea,” replied D’Artagnan, “to have Dutch
cannon-balls cast which will return to the Dutch.”

“Is it not, with loss, too?” And Colbert laughed aloud. He was delighted
with his own joke.

“Still further,” added he, “these same Dutch are building for the king,
at this moment, six vessels after the model of the best of their name.
Destouches--Ah! perhaps you don’t know Destouches?”

“No, monsieur.”

“He is a man who has a sure glance to discern, when a ship is launched,
what are the defects and qualities of that ship--that is valuable,
observe! Nature is truly whimsical. Well, this Destouches appeared to
me to be a man likely to prove useful in marine affairs, and he is
superintending the construction of six vessels of seventy-eight guns,
which the Provinces are building for his majesty. It results from this,
my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, that the king, if he wished to quarrel with
the Provinces, would have a very pretty fleet. Now, you know better than
anybody else if the land army is efficient.”

D’Artagnan and Aramis looked at each other, wondering at the mysterious
labors this man had undertaken in so short a time. Colbert understood
them, and was touched by this best of flatteries.

“If we, in France, were ignorant of what was going on,” said D’Artagnan,
“out of France still less must be known.”

“That is why I told monsieur l’ambassadeur,” said Colbert, “that, Spain
promising its neutrality, England helping us--”

“If England assists you,” said Aramis, “I promise the neutrality of
Spain.”

“I take you at your word,” Colbert hastened to reply with his blunt
_bonhomie_. “And, _a propos_ of Spain, you have not the ‘Golden Fleece,’
Monsieur d’Almeda. I heard the king say the other day that he should
like to see you wear the _grand cordon_ of St. Michael.”

Aramis bowed. “Oh!” thought D’Artagnan, “and Porthos is no longer here!
What ells of ribbons would there be for him in these _largesses!_ Dear
Porthos!”

“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” resumed Colbert, “between us two, you will have,
I wager, an inclination to lead your musketeers into Holland. Can you
swim?” And he laughed like a man in high good humor.

“Like an eel,” replied D’Artagnan.

“Ah! but there are some bitter passages of canals and marshes yonder,
Monsieur d’Artagnan, and the best swimmers are sometimes drowned there.”

“It is my profession to die for his majesty,” said the musketeer. “Only,
as it is seldom in war that much water is met with without a little
fire, I declare to you beforehand, that I will do my best to choose
fire. I am getting old; water freezes me--but fire warms, Monsieur
Colbert.”

And D’Artagnan looked so handsome still in quasi-juvenile strength as
he pronounced these words, that Colbert, in his turn, could not help
admiring him. D’Artagnan perceived the effect he had produced. He
remembered that the best tradesman is he who fixes a high price upon his
goods, when they are valuable. He prepared his price in advance.

“So, then,” said Colbert, “we go into Holland?”

“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan; “only--”

“Only?” said M. Colbert.

“Only,” repeated D’Artagnan, “there lurks in everything the question of
interest, the question of self-love. It is a very fine title, that of
captain of the musketeers; but observe this: we have now the king’s
guards and the military household of the king. A captain of musketeers
ought to command all that, and then he would absorb a hundred thousand
livres a year for expenses.”

“Well! but do you suppose the king would haggle with you?” said Colbert.

“Eh! monsieur, you have not understood me,” replied D’Artagnan, sure of
carrying his point. “I was telling you that I, an old captain, formerly
chief of the king’s guard, having precedence of the _marechaux_ of
France--I saw myself one day in the trenches with two other equals, the
captain of the guards and the colonel commanding the Swiss. Now, at no
price will I suffer that. I have old habits, and I will stand or fall by
them.”

Colbert felt this blow, but he was prepared for it.

“I have been thinking of what you said just now,” replied he.

“About what, monsieur?”

“We were speaking of canals and marshes in which people are drowned.”

“Well!”

“Well! if they are drowned, it is for want of a boat, a plank, or a
stick.”

“Of a stick, however short it may be,” said D’Artagnan.

“Exactly,” said Colbert. “And, therefore, I never heard of an instance
of a _marechal_ of France being drowned.”

D’Artagnan became very pale with joy, and in a not very firm voice,
“People would be very proud of me in my country,” said he, “if I were
a _marechal_ of France; but a man must have commanded an expedition in
chief to obtain the _baton_.”

“Monsieur!” said Colbert, “here is in this pocket-book which you will
study, a plan of campaign you will have to lead a body of troops to
carry out in the next spring.” [12]

D’Artagnan took the book, tremblingly, and his fingers meeting those of
Colbert, the minister pressed the hand of the musketeer loyally.

“Monsieur,” said he, “we had both a revenge to take, one over the other.
I have begun; it is now your turn!”

“I will do you justice, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and implore you
to tell the king that the first opportunity that shall offer, he may
depend upon a victory, or to behold me dead--_or both_.”

“Then I will have the _fleurs-de-lis_ for your _marechal’s baton_
prepared immediately,” said Colbert.

On the morrow, Aramis, who was setting out for Madrid, to negotiate the
neutrality of Spain, came to embrace D’Artagnan at his hotel.

“Let us love each other for four,” said D’Artagnan. “We are now but
two.”

“And you will, perhaps, never see me again, dear D’Artagnan,” said
Aramis; “if you knew how I have loved you! I am old, I am extinct--ah, I
am almost dead.”

“My friend,” said D’Artagnan, “you will live longer than I shall:
diplomacy commands you to live; but, for my part, honor condemns me to
die.”

“Bah! such men as we are, monsieur le marechal,” said Aramis, “only die
satisfied with joy in glory.”

“Ah!” replied D’Artagnan, with a melancholy smile, “I assure you,
monsieur le duc, I feel very little appetite for either.”

They once more embraced, and, two hours after, separated--forever.


The Death of D’Artagnan.

Contrary to that which generally happens, whether in politics or morals,
each kept his promises, and did honor to his engagements.

The king recalled M. de Guiche, and banished M. le Chevalier de
Lorraine; so that Monsieur became ill in consequence. Madame set out
for London, where she applied herself so earnestly to make her brother,
Charles II., acquire a taste for the political counsels of Mademoiselle
de Keroualle, that the alliance between England and France was signed,
and the English vessels, ballasted by a few millions of French gold,
made a terrible campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces.
Charles II. had promised Mademoiselle de Keroualle a little gratitude
for her good counsels; he made her Duchess of Portsmouth. Colbert had
promised the king vessels, munitions, victories. He kept his word, as
is well known. At length Aramis, upon whose promises there was least
dependence to be placed, wrote Colbert the following letter, on the
subject of the negotiations which he had undertaken at Madrid:

“MONSIEUR COLBERT,--I have the honor to expedite to you the R. P. Oliva,
general _ad interim_ of the Society of Jesus, my provisional successor.
The reverend father will explain to you, Monsieur Colbert, that I
preserve to myself the direction of all the affairs of the order which
concern France and Spain; but that I am not willing to retain the title
of general, which would throw too high a side-light on the progress of
the negotiations with which His Catholic Majesty wishes to intrust me. I
shall resume that title by the command of his majesty, when the labors I
have undertaken in concert with you, for the great glory of God and His
Church, shall be brought to a good end. The R. P. Oliva will inform you
likewise, monsieur, of the consent His Catholic Majesty gives to the
signature of a treaty which assures the neutrality of Spain in the event
of a war between France and the United Provinces. This consent will be
valid even if England, instead of being active, should satisfy herself
with remaining neutral. As for Portugal, of which you and I have spoken,
monsieur, I can assure you it will contribute with all its resources to
assist the Most Christian King in his war. I beg you, Monsieur
Colbert, to preserve your friendship and also to believe in my profound
attachment, and to lay my respect at the feet of His Most Christian
Majesty. Signed,

“LE DUC D’ALMEDA.” [13]


Aramis had performed more than he had promised; it remained to be seen
how the king, M. Colbert, and D’Artagnan would be faithful to each
other. In the spring, as Colbert had predicted, the land army entered
on its campaign. It preceded, in magnificent order, the court of Louis
XIV., who, setting out on horseback, surrounded by carriages filled
with ladies and courtiers, conducted the _elite_ of his kingdom to this
sanguinary _fete_. The officers of the army, it is true, had no other
music save the artillery of the Dutch forts; but it was enough for a
great number, who found in this war honor, advancement, fortune--or
death.

M. d’Artagnan set out commanding a body of twelve thousand men, cavalry,
and infantry, with which he was ordered to take the different places
which form knots of that strategic network called La Frise. Never was an
army conducted more gallantly to an expedition. The officers knew that
their leader, prudent and skillful as he was brave, would not sacrifice
a single man, nor yield an inch of ground without necessity. He had
the old habits of war, to live upon the country, keeping his soldiers
singing and the enemy weeping. The captain of the king’s musketeers
well knew his business. Never were opportunities better chosen,
_coups-de-main_ better supported, errors of the besieged more quickly
taken advantage of.

The army commanded by D’Artagnan took twelve small places within a
month. He was engaged in besieging the thirteenth, which had held out
five days. D’Artagnan caused the trenches to be opened without appearing
to suppose that these people would ever allow themselves to be taken.
The pioneers and laborers were, in the army of this man, a body full of
ideas and zeal, because their commander treated them like soldiers, knew
how to render their work glorious, and never allowed them to be killed
if he could help it. It should have been seen with what eagerness the
marshy glebes of Holland were turned over. Those turf-heaps, mounds of
potter’s clay, melted at the word of the soldiers like butter in the
frying-pans of Friesland housewives.

M. d’Artagnan dispatched a courier to the king to give him an account of
the last success, which redoubled the good humor of his majesty and his
inclination to amuse the ladies. These victories of M. d’Artagnan gave
so much majesty to the prince, that Madame de Montespan no longer
called him anything but Louis the Invincible. So that Mademoiselle de
la Valliere, who only called the king Louis the Victorious, lost much
of his majesty’s favor. Besides, her eyes were frequently red, and to an
Invincible nothing is more disagreeable than a mistress who weeps while
everything is smiling round her. The star of Mademoiselle de la Valliere
was being drowned in clouds and tears. But the gayety of Madame de
Montespan redoubled with the successes of the king, and consoled him for
every other unpleasant circumstance. It was to D’Artagnan the king owed
this; and his majesty was anxious to acknowledge these services; he
wrote to M. Colbert:

“MONSIEUR COLBERT,--We have a promise to fulfil with M. d’Artagnan,
who so well keeps his. This is to inform you that the time is come for
performing it. All provisions for this purpose you shall be furnished
with in due time. LOUIS.”

In consequence of this, Colbert, detaining D’Artagnan’s envoy, placed in
the hands of that messenger a letter from himself, and a small coffer
of ebony inlaid with gold, not very important in appearance, but which,
without doubt, was very heavy, as a guard of five men was given to the
messenger, to assist him in carrying it. These people arrived before
the place which D’Artagnan was besieging towards daybreak, and presented
themselves at the lodgings of the general. They were told that M.
d’Artagnan, annoyed by a sortie which the governor, an artful man, had
made the evening before, and in which the works had been destroyed and
seventy-seven men killed, and the reparation of the breaches commenced,
had just gone with twenty companies of grenadiers to reconstruct the
works.

M. Colbert’s envoy had orders to go and seek M. d’Artagnan, wherever
he might be, or at whatever hour of the day or night. He directed his
course, therefore, towards the trenches, followed by his escort, all
on horseback. They perceived M. d’Artagnan in the open plain, with his
gold-laced hat, his long cane, and gilt cuffs. He was biting his white
mustache, and wiping off, with his left hand, the dust which the passing
balls threw up from the ground they plowed so near him. They also saw,
amidst this terrible fire, which filled the air with whistling hisses,
officers handling the shovel, soldiers rolling barrows, and vast
fascines, rising by being either carried or dragged by from ten to
twenty men, cover the front of the trench reopened to the center by this
extraordinary effort of the general. In three hours, all was reinstated.
D’Artagnan began to speak more mildly; and he became quite calm when the
captain of the pioneers approached him, hat in hand, to tell him that
the trench was again in proper order. This man had scarcely finished
speaking, when a ball took off one of his legs, and he fell into the
arms of D’Artagnan. The latter lifted up his soldier, and quietly, with
soothing words, carried him into the trench, amidst the enthusiastic
applause of the regiments. From that time it was no longer a question of
valor--the army was delirious; two companies stole away to the advanced
posts, which they instantly destroyed.

When their comrades, restrained with great difficulty by D’Artagnan, saw
them lodged upon the bastions, they rushed forward likewise; and soon a
furious assault was made upon the counterscarp, upon which depended the
safety of the place. D’Artagnan perceived there was only one means left
of checking his army--to take the place. He directed all his force to
the two breaches, where the besieged were busy in repairing. The shock
was terrible; eighteen companies took part in it, and D’Artagnan went
with the rest, within half cannon-shot of the place, to support the
attack by _echelons_. The cries of the Dutch, who were being poniarded
upon their guns by D’Artagnan’s grenadiers, were distinctly audible. The
struggle grew fiercer with the despair of the governor, who disputed his
position foot by foot. D’Artagnan, to put an end to the affair, and
to silence the fire, which was unceasing, sent a fresh column, which
penetrated like a very wedge; and he soon perceived upon the ramparts,
through the fire, the terrified flight of the besieged, pursued by the
besiegers.

At this moment the general, breathing feely and full of joy, heard a
voice behind him, saying, “Monsieur, if you please, from M. Colbert.”

He broke the seal of the letter, which contained these words:

“MONSIEUR D’ARTAGNAN:--The king commands me to inform you that he has
nominated you marechal of France, as a reward for your magnificent
services, and the honor you do to his arms. The king is highly
pleased, monsieur, with the captures you have made; he commands you, in
particular, to finish the siege you have commenced, with good fortune to
you, and success for him.”

D’Artagnan was standing with a radiant countenance and sparkling eye.
He looked up to watch the progress of his troops upon the walls, still
enveloped in red and black volumes of smoke. “I have finished,” replied
he to the messenger; “the city will have surrendered in a quarter of an
hour.” He then resumed his reading:

“The _coffret_, Monsieur d’Artagnan, is my own present. You will not be
sorry to see that, whilst you warriors are drawing the sword to defend
the king, I am moving the pacific arts to ornament a present worthy of
you. I commend myself to your friendship, monsieur le marechal, and beg
you to believe in mine. COLBERT”

D’Artagnan, intoxicated with joy, made a sign to the messenger, who
approached, with his _coffret_ in his hands. But at the moment the
_marechal_ was going to look at it, a loud explosion resounded from the
ramparts, and called his attention towards the city. “It is strange,”
 said D’Artagnan, “that I don’t yet see the king’s flag on the walls, or
hear the drums beat the _chamade_.” He launched three hundred fresh men,
under a high-spirited officer, and ordered another breach to be made.
Then, more tranquilly, he turned towards the _coffret_, which Colbert’s
envoy held out to him.--It was his treasure--he had won it.

D’Artagnan was holding out his hand to open the _coffret_, when a ball
from the city crushed the _coffret_ in the arms of the officer, struck
D’Artagnan full in the chest, and knocked him down upon a sloping heap
of earth, whilst the _fleur-de-lised baton_, escaping from the broken
box, came rolling under the powerless hand of the _marechal_. D’Artagnan
endeavored to raise himself. It was thought he had been knocked down
without being wounded. A terrible cry broke from the group of terrified
officers; the _marechal_ was covered with blood; the pallor of death
ascended slowly to his noble countenance. Leaning upon the arms held
out on all sides to receive him, he was able once more to turn his eyes
towards the place, and to distinguish the white flag at the crest of the
principal bastion; his ears, already deaf to the sounds of life, caught
feebly the rolling of the drum which announced the victory. Then,
clasping in his nerveless hand the _baton_, ornamented with its
_fleurs-de-lis_, he cast on it his eyes, which had no longer the power
of looking upwards towards Heaven, and fell back, murmuring strange
words, which appeared to the soldiers cabalistic--words which had
formerly represented so many things on earth, and which none but the
dying man any longer comprehended:

“Athos--Porthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!”

Of the four valiant men whose history we have related, there now
remained but one. Heaven had taken to itself three noble souls. [14]

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

                                   1


Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not
think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it
meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked
it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling
of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at
Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock
down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a
thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider
Kelly’s star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box
like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five
or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really
very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got
his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn’s distaste for
boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and
it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read
too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his
class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was
middleweight boxing champion.

I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories
hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had
never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had
stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or
seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young
child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.
Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had
become of him.

Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest
Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the
oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and
played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him
race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence
any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a
nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took
it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful
self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first
girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children,
lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance
of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather
unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just
when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off
with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about
leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to
deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In
California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little
of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of
the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and
finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been
regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the
editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the
sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority
of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he
had to give it up.

By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been
taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was
very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand.
Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine
was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and
decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was
still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where
Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated,
and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in
travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks
and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.

The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the
second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert
changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute
determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert’s mother
had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.
During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at
another woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living
in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered
writing. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the
critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many
books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.

I first became aware of his lady’s attitude toward him one night after
the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l’Avenue’s and
afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several
_fines_ after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been
talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He
wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to
Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.
“I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,” I said.

Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went
on: “She’s been there two years and knows everything there is to know
about the town. She’s a swell girl.”

I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert’s
lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

“Hell,” I said, “why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to
the Ardennes.”

Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went
out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner
with me. “For God’s sake,” he said, “why did you say that about that
girl in Strasbourg for? Didn’t you see Frances?”

“No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg
what the hell is it to Frances?”

“It doesn’t make any difference. Any girl. I couldn’t go, that would be
all.”

“Don’t be silly.”

“You don’t know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn’t you see the way she
looked?”

“Oh, well,” I said, “let’s go to Senlis.”

“Don’t get sore.”

“I’m not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf
and take a hike in the woods and come home.”

“Good, that will be fine.”

“Well, I’ll see you to-morrow at the courts,” I said.

“Good-night, Jake,” he said, and started back to the café.

“You forgot to get your paper,” I said.

“That’s so.” He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. “You are
not sore, are you, Jake?” He turned with the paper in his hand.

“No, why should I be?”

“See you at tennis,” he said. I watched him walk back to the café
holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a
life.




                                CHAPTER
                                   2


That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was
accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I
heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several
women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite
changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was
not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his
novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women
had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all
shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his
wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond
Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.

He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college,
and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not
been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he
realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact
of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a
divine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have
around. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some
rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held
cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his
bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make
a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.

Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That
sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread “The
Purple Land.” “The Purple Land” is a very sinister book if read too late
in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect
English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is
very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book
to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same
age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a
complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took
every word of “The Purple Land” as literally as though it had been an
R. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on
the whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set
him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until
one day he came into my office.

“Hello, Robert,” I said. “Did you come in to cheer me up?”

“Would you like to go to South America, Jake?” he asked.

“No.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the
South Americans you want in Paris anyway.”

“They’re not the real South Americans.”

“They look awfully real to me.”

I had a boat train to catch with a week’s mail stories, and only half of
them written.

“Do you know any dirt?” I asked.

“No.”

“None of your exalted connections getting divorces?”

“No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South
America with me?”

“Why me?”

“You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us.”

“No,” I said, “I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time.”

“All my life I’ve wanted to go on a trip like that,” Cohn said. He sat
down. “I’ll be too old before I can ever do it.”

“Don’t be a fool,” I said. “You can go anywhere you want. You’ve got
plenty of money.”

“I know. But I can’t get started.”

“Cheer up,” I said. “All countries look just like the moving pictures.”

But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.

“I can’t stand it to think my life is going so fast and I’m not really
living it.”

“Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.”

“I’m not interested in bull-fighters. That’s an abnormal life. I want to
go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip.”

“Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?”

“No, I wouldn’t like that.”

“I’d go there with you.”

“No; that doesn’t interest me.”

“That’s because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book
all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.”

“I want to go to South America.”

He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.

“Come on down-stairs and have a drink.”

“Aren’t you working?”

“No,” I said. We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I
had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had
a drink all you had to say was: “Well, I’ve got to get back and get off
some cables,” and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful
exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important
part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we
went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at
the bottles in bins around the wall. “This is a good place,” he said.

“There’s a lot of liquor,” I agreed.

“Listen, Jake,” he leaned forward on the bar. “Don’t you ever get the
feeling that all your life is going by and you’re not taking advantage
of it? Do you realize you’ve lived nearly half the time you have to live
already?”

“Yes, every once in a while.”

“Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we’ll be dead?”

“What the hell, Robert,” I said. “What the hell.”

“I’m serious.”

“It’s one thing I don’t worry about,” I said.

“You ought to.”

“I’ve had plenty to worry about one time or other. I’m through
worrying.”

“Well, I want to go to South America.”

“Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn’t make any difference.
I’ve tried all that. You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one
place to another. There’s nothing to that.”

“But you’ve never been to South America.”

“South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be
exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don’t you start living your
life in Paris?”

“I’m sick of Paris, and I’m sick of the Quarter.”

“Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what
happens to you.”

“Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing
happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.”

“Wasn’t the town nice at night?”

“I don’t care for Paris.”

So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could
do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two
stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He
got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a
book too.

“Well,” I said, “I’ve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.”

“Do you really have to go?”

“Yes, I’ve got to get these cables off.”

“Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?”

“No, come on up.”

He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and
Publisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the
carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila
envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went
out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big
chair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake
him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on
his shoulder. He shook his head. “I can’t do it,” he said, and put his
head deeper into his arms. “I can’t do it. Nothing will make me do it.”

“Robert,” I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled
and blinked.

“Did I talk out loud just then?”

“Something. But it wasn’t clear.”

“God, what a rotten dream!”

“Did the typewriter put you to sleep?”

“Guess so. I didn’t sleep all last night.”

“What was the matter?”

“Talking,” he said.

I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom
scenes of my friends. We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an
_apéritif_ and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.




                                CHAPTER
                                   3


It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the
Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric
signs come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the
crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge
of the solid taxi traffic, and the _poules_ going by, singly and in
pairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk
past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her,
and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She
went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down
at the table. The waiter came up.

“Well, what will you drink?” I asked.

“Pernod.”

“That’s not good for little girls.”

“Little girl yourself. Dites garçon, un pernod.”

“A pernod for me, too.”

“What’s the matter?” she asked. “Going on a party?”

“Sure. Aren’t you?”

“I don’t know. You never know in this town.”

“Don’t you like Paris?”

“No.”

“Why don’t you go somewhere else?”

“Isn’t anywhere else.”

“You’re happy, all right.”

“Happy, hell!”

Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns
milky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops
you just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.

“Well,” I said, “are you going to buy me a dinner?”

She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her
mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we
walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up
at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling _fiacre_ we
moved up the Avenue de l’Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops,
their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.
The cab passed the New York _Herald_ bureau with the window full of
clocks.

“What are all the clocks for?” she asked.

“They show the hour all over America.”

“Don’t kid me.”

We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic
of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She
cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be
kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.

“Never mind.”

“What’s the matter? You sick?”

“Yes.”

“Everybody’s sick. I’m sick, too.”

We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and
then turned up the Rue des Saints Pères.

“You oughtn’t to drink pernod if you’re sick.”

“You neither.”

“It doesn’t make any difference with me. It doesn’t make any difference
with a woman.”

“What are you called?”

“Georgette. How are you called?”

“Jacob.”

“That’s a Flemish name.”

“American too.”

“You’re not Flamand?”

“No, American.”

“Good, I detest Flamands.”

By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the _cocher_ to
stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.
“This is no great thing of a restaurant.”

“No,” I said. “Maybe you would rather go to Foyot’s. Why don’t you keep
the cab and go on?”

I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be
nice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a
_poule_, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the
restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room.
Georgette cheered up a little under the food.

“It isn’t bad here,” she said. “It isn’t chic, but the food is all
right.”

“Better than you eat in Liège.”

“Brussels, you mean.”

We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and
showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. “You’re not a bad
type,” she said. “It’s a shame you’re sick. We get on well. What’s the
matter with you, anyway?”

“I got hurt in the war,” I said.

“Oh, that dirty war.”

We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it
was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been
better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some
one called: “Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!”

“It’s a friend calling me,” I explained, and went out.

There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne,
Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.

“You’re coming to the dance, aren’t you?” Braddocks asked.

“What dance?”

“Why, the dancings. Don’t you know we’ve revived them?” Mrs. Braddocks
put in.

“You must come, Jake. We’re all going,” Frances said from the end of the
table. She was tall and had a smile.

“Of course, he’s coming,” Braddocks said. “Come in and have coffee with
us, Barnes.”

“Right.”

“And bring your friend,” said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a
Canadian and had all their easy social graces.

“Thanks, we’ll be in,” I said. I went back to the small room.

“Who are your friends?” Georgette asked.

“Writers and artists.”

“There are lots of those on this side of the river.”

“Too many.”

“I think so. Still, some of them make money.”

“Oh, yes.”

We finished the meal and the wine. “Come on,” I said. “We’re going to
have coffee with the others.”

Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in
the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and
straightened her hat.

“Good,” she said.

We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his
table stood up.

“I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,” I said.
Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.

“Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?” Mrs. Braddocks
asked.

“Connais pas,” Georgette answered.

“But you have the same name,” Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.

“No,” said Georgette. “Not at all. My name is Hobin.”

“But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely
he did,” insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking
French was liable to have no idea what she was saying.

“He’s a fool,” Georgette said.

“Oh, it was a joke, then,” Mrs. Braddocks said.

“Yes,” said Georgette. “To laugh at.”

“Did you hear that, Henry?” Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to
Braddocks. “Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc,
and her name is actually Hobin.”

“Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I’ve known her for a very long
time.”

“Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,” Frances Clyne called, speaking French very
rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its
coming out really French. “Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it
here? You love Paris, do you not?”

“Who’s she?” Georgette turned to me. “Do I have to talk to her?”

She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head
poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.

“No, I don’t like Paris. It’s expensive and dirty.”

“Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities
in all Europe.”

“I find it dirty.”

“How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.”

“I’ve been here long enough.”

“But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.”

Georgette turned to me. “You have nice friends.”

Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but
the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all
went out and started for Braddocks’s dancing-club.

The dancing-club was a _bal musette_ in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte
Geneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter
danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights
it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a
policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the
zinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came
downstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across
the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.

“I wish people would come earlier,” Braddocks said. The daughter came up
and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high
stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a
string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as
he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor
perspiring.

“My God,” Georgette said. “What a box to sweat in!”

“It’s hot.”

“Hot, my God!”

“Take off your hat.”

“That’s a good idea.”

Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was
really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I
drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of
wind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They
both stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys
and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and
newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman
standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went
in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces,
grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very
lovely and she was very much with them.

One of them saw Georgette and said: “I do declare. There is an actual
harlot. I’m going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me.”

The tall dark one, called Lett, said: “Don’t you be rash.”

The wavy blond one answered: “Don’t you worry, dear.” And with them was
Brett.

I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are
supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to
swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering
composure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar
at the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take
the taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd
on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who
danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he
danced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to
dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all
dance with her. They are like that.

I sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs.
Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He
was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He
had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.

“Thanks so much,” he said, “I’ve just had one.”

“Have another.”

“Thanks, I will then.”

We got the daughter of the house over and each had a _fine à l’eau_.

“You’re from Kansas City, they tell me,” he said.

“Yes.”

“Do you find Paris amusing?”

“Yes.”

“Really?”

I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to
be careless.

“For God’s sake,” I said, “yes. Don’t you?”

“Oh, how charmingly you get angry,” he said. “I wish I had that
faculty.”

I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks
followed me. “Don’t be cross with Robert,” she said. “He’s still only a
child, you know.”

“I wasn’t cross,” I said. “I just thought perhaps I was going to throw
up.”

“Your fiancée is having a great success,” Mrs. Braddocks looked out on
the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one,
called Lett.

“Isn’t she?” I said.

“Rather,” said Mrs. Braddocks.

Cohn came up. “Come on, Jake,” he said, “have a drink.” We walked over
to the bar. “What’s the matter with you? You seem all worked up over
something?”

“Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all.”

Brett came up to the bar.

“Hello, you chaps.”

“Hello, Brett,” I said. “Why aren’t you tight?”

“Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and
soda.”

She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He
looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the
promised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look
of eager, deserving expectation.

Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a
tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy’s. She started all
that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you
missed none of it with that wool jersey.

“It’s a fine crowd you’re with, Brett,” I said.

“Aren’t they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?”

“At the Napolitain.”

“And have you had a lovely evening?”

“Oh, priceless,” I said.

Brett laughed. “It’s wrong of you, Jake. It’s an insult to all of us.
Look at Frances there, and Jo.”

This for Cohn’s benefit.

“It’s in restraint of trade,” Brett said. She laughed again.

“You’re wonderfully sober,” I said.

“Yes. Aren’t I? And when one’s with the crowd I’m with, one can drink in
such safety, too.”

The music started and Robert Cohn said: “Will you dance this with me,
Lady Brett?”

Brett smiled at him. “I’ve promised to dance this with Jacob,” she
laughed. “You’ve a hell of a biblical name, Jake.”

“How about the next?” asked Cohn.

“We’re going,” Brett said. “We’ve a date up at Montmartre.” Dancing, I
looked over Brett’s shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still
watching her.

“You’ve made a new one there,” I said to her.

“Don’t talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.”

“Oh, well,” I said. “I suppose you like to add them up.”

“Don’t talk like a fool.”

“You do.”

“Oh, well. What if I do?”

“Nothing,” I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was
playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to
Georgette dancing with another one of them.

“What possessed you to bring her?”

“I don’t know, I just brought her.”

“You’re getting damned romantic.”

“No, bored.”

“Now?”

“No, not now.”

“Let’s get out of here. She’s well taken care of.”

“Do you want to?”

“Would I ask you if I didn’t want to?”

We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it
on. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the
bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a
fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and
handed it to the patronne.

“If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?” I said.
“If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for
me?”

“C’est entendu, Monsieur,” the patronne said. “You go now? So early?”

“Yes,” I said.

We started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good
night and took my arm. “Good night, Cohn,” I said. Outside in the street
we looked for a taxi.

“You’re going to lose your fifty francs,” Brett said.

“Oh, yes.”

“No taxis.”

“We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.”

“Come on and we’ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.”

“You wouldn’t walk across the street.”

“Not if I could help it.”

We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.

“Well,” I said, “we’re out away from them.”

We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each
other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my
hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. “Where should I
tell him?” I asked.

“Oh, tell him to drive around.”

I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed
the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got
in and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.

“Oh, darling, I’ve been so miserable,” Brett said.




                                CHAPTER
                                   4


The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the
dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St.
Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and
the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the
cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open
shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted
close together going down the old street. Brett’s hat was off. Her head
was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was
dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des
Gobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks
by the light of acetylene flares. Brett’s face was white and the long
line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street
was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then
she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away
as she could get. Her head was down.

“Don’t touch me,” she said. “Please don’t touch me.”

“What’s the matter?”

“I can’t stand it.”

“Oh, Brett.”

“You mustn’t. You must know. I can’t stand it, that’s all. Oh, darling,
please understand!”

“Don’t you love me?”

“Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.”

“Isn’t there anything we can do about it?”

She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back
against me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with
that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw
out of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else’s
eyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there
were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she
was afraid of so many things.

“And there’s not a damn thing we could do,” I said.

“I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t want to go through that hell again.”

“We’d better keep away from each other.”

“But, darling, I have to see you. It isn’t all that you know.”

“No, but it always gets to be.”

“That’s my fault. Don’t we pay for all the things we do, though?”

She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different
depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the
way into them.

“When I think of the hell I’ve put chaps through. I’m paying for it all
now.”

“Don’t talk like a fool,” I said. “Besides, what happened to me is
supposed to be funny. I never think about it.”

“Oh, no. I’ll lay you don’t.”

“Well, let’s shut up about it.”

“I laughed about it too, myself, once.” She wasn’t looking at me. “A
friend of my brother’s came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a
hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?”

“No,” I said. “Nobody ever knows anything.”

I was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had
probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the
one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment
while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.

“It’s funny,” I said. “It’s very funny. And it’s a lot of fun, too, to
be in love.”

“Do you think so?” her eyes looked flat again.

“I don’t mean fun that way. In a way it’s an enjoyable feeling.”

“No,” she said. “I think it’s hell on earth.”

“It’s good to see each other.”

“No. I don’t think it is.”

“Don’t you want to?”

“I have to.”

We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc
Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and
where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The
driver leaned his head around.

“Where do you want to go?” I asked. Brett turned her head away.

“Oh, go to the Select.”

“Café Select,” I told the driver. “Boulevard Montparnasse.” We drove
straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the
passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard
Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: “Would
you mind very much if I asked you to do something?”

“Don’t be silly.”

“Kiss me just once more before we get there.”

When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her
hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. “I
say, do I look too much of a mess?” She pulled her man’s felt hat down
and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were
most of the crowd who a been at the dance.

“Hello, you chaps,” Brett said. “I’m going to have a drink.”

“Oh, Brett! Brett!” the little Greek portrait-painter, who called
himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. “I got
something fine to tell you.”

“Hello, Zizi,” Brett said.

“I want you to meet a friend,” Zizi said. A fat man came up.

“Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.”

“How do you do?” said Brett.

“Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?” asked Count
Mippipopolous, who wore an elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.

“Rather,” said Brett.

“Paris is a fine town all right,” said the count. “But I guess you have
pretty big doings yourself over in London.”

“Oh, yes,” said Brett. “Enormous.”

Braddocks called to me from a table. “Barnes,” he said, “have a drink.
That girl of yours got in a frightful row.”

“What about?”

“Something the patronne’s daughter said. A corking row. She was rather
splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne’s
daughter’s too. I say it was a row.”

“What finally happened?”

“Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command
of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.”

“No,” I said. “I must shove off. Seen Cohn?”

“He went home with Frances,” Mrs. Braddock put in.

“Poor chap, he looks awfully down,” Braddocks said.

“I dare say he is,” said Mrs. Braddocks.

“I have to shove off,” I said. “Good night.”

I said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne.
“Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?” he asked.

“No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.”

“Really going?” Brett asked.

“Yes,” I said. “I’ve got a rotten headache.”

“I’ll see you to-morrow?”

“Come in at the office.”

“Hardly.”

“Well, where will I see you?”

“Anywhere around five o’clock.”

“Make it the other side of town then.”

“Good. I’ll be at the Crillon at five.”

“Try and be there,” I said.

“Don’t worry,” Brett said. “I’ve never let you down, have I?”

“Heard from Mike?”

“Letter to-day.”

“Good night, sir,” said the count.

I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St.
Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across
the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the
pavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was
and went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was
deserted. Lavigne’s was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables
outside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney’s statue standing among the
new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple
wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription:
from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine,
Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green
new horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little
way down the Boulevard St. Michel.

There was a light in the concierge’s room and I knocked on the door and
she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There
were two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light
in the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank
statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and
deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered
I had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement.
The other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby
announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine—I knew neither the
girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town.
It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name
like Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the
announcement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was
funny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell
with you, Lady Ashley.

I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide
windows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the
windows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on
the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They
were noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at
myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a
typically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of
all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas
and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their
wrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the
same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. _Le Toril_
was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way
through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew
out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.

My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to
be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian
hospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in
Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in
the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was
the Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was
Zonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was
funny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But
they had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: “You, a
foreigner, an Englishman” (any foreigner was an Englishman) “have given
more than your life.” What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated
to hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my
place, I guess. “Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!”

I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just
not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble
if I hadn’t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose
she only wanted what she couldn’t have. Well, people were that way. To
hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of
handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it
was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.

I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn’t keep
away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it
went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around
and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I
started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and
listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I
went to sleep.

I woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I
recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The
concierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name
and called down the stairs.

“Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?” the concierge called.

“Yes. It’s me.”

“There’s a species of woman here who’s waked the whole street up. What
kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see
you. I’ve told her you’re asleep.”

Then I heard Brett’s voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was
Georgette. I don’t know why. She could not have known my address.

“Will you send her up, please?”

Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. “Silly thing to
do,” she said. “Make an awful row. I say, you weren’t asleep, were you?”

“What did you think I was doing?”

“Don’t know. What time is it?”

I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. “Had no idea what hour it
was,” Brett said. “I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling.
Just left the count. He brought me here.”

“What’s he like?” I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.

“Just a little,” said Brett. “Don’t try and make me drunk. The count?
Oh, rather. He’s quite one of us.”

“Is he a count?”

“Here’s how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows
hell’s own amount about people. Don’t know where he got it all. Owns a
chain of sweetshops in the States.”

She sipped at her glass.

“Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up.
Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He’s one of us, though.
Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell.”

She took another drink.

“How do I buck on about all this? You don’t mind, do you? He’s putting
up for Zizi, you know.”

“Is Zizi really a duke, too?”

“I shouldn’t wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the
count.”

“Where did you go with him?”

“Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand
dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?”

“Around two thousand.”

“Lot of money. I told him I couldn’t do it. He was awfully nice about
it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.”

Brett laughed.

“I say, you are slow on the up-take,” she said. I had only sipped my
brandy and soda. I took a long drink.

“That’s better. Very funny,” Brett said. “Then he wanted me to go to
Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo.
Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many
people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here.”

She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. “Don’t look
like that,” she said. “Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don’t
look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to
dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?”

“Why not?”

“I’d better go now.”

“Why?”

“Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come
down? He’s got the car just up the street.”

“The count?”

“Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have
breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli’s. Dozen bottles of
Mumms. Tempt you?”

“I have to work in the morning,” I said. “I’m too far behind you now to
catch up and be any fun.”

“Don’t be an ass.”

“Can’t do it.”

“Right. Send him a tender message?”

“Anything. Absolutely.”

“Good night, darling.”

“Don’t be sentimental.”

“You make me ill.”

We kissed good night and Brett shivered. “I’d better go,” she said.
“Good night, darling.”

“You don’t have to go.”

“Yes.”

We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the
concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and
from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big
limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it
started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a
glass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen
and poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in
the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into
bed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought
of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last
seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is
awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at
night it is another thing.




                                CHAPTER
                                   5


In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for
coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in
the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant
early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee
and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the
market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the
law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams
and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the
Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked
along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I
passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I
stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl
assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the
thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy.
Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a
man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the
sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt
pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in
to my office.

Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and
then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning’s work. At eleven
o’clock I went over to the Quai d’Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat
with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece,
a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles,
talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the
Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.
Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a
couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the
answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d’Orsay
with Woolsey and Krum.

“What do you do nights, Jake?” asked Krum. “I never see you around.”

“Oh, I’m over in the Quarter.”

“I’m coming over some night. The Dingo. That’s the great place, isn’t
it?”

“Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select.”

“I’ve meant to get over,” said Krum. “You know how it is, though, with a
wife and kids.”

“Playing any tennis?” Woolsey asked.

“Well, no,” said Krum. “I can’t say I’ve played any this year. I’ve
tried to get away, but Sundays it’s always rained, and the courts are so
damned crowded.”

“The Englishmen all have Saturday off,” Woolsey said.

“Lucky beggars,” said Krum. “Well, I’ll tell you. Some day I’m not going
to be working for an agency. Then I’ll have plenty of time to get out in
the country.”

“That’s the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.”

“I’ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.”

I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. “Here’s my street,” I
said. “Come in and have a drink.”

“Thanks, old man,” Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. “I’ve got to file
that line he got off this morning.”

I put a two-franc piece in Krum’s hand.

“You’re crazy, Jake,” he said. “This is on me.”

“It’s all on the office, anyway.”

“Nope. I want to get it.”

I waved good-by. Krum put his head out. “See you at the lunch on
Wednesday.”

“You bet.”

I went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me.
“Hello, Jake,” he said. “Going out to lunch?”

“Yes. Let me see if there is anything new.”

“Where will we eat?”

“Anywhere.”

I was looking over my desk. “Where do you want to eat?”

“How about Wetzel’s? They’ve got good hors d’œuvres.”

In the restaurant we ordered hors d’œuvres and beer. The sommelier
brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold.
There were a dozen different dishes of hors d’œuvres.

“Have any fun last night?” I asked.

“No. I don’t think so.”

“How’s the writing going?”

“Rotten. I can’t get this second book going.”

“That happens to everybody.”

“Oh, I’m sure of that. It gets me worried, though.”

“Thought any more about going to South America?”

“I mean that.”

“Well, why don’t you start off?”

“Frances.”

“Well,” I said, “take her with you.”

“She wouldn’t like it. That isn’t the sort of thing she likes. She likes
a lot of people around.”

“Tell her to go to hell.”

“I can’t. I’ve got certain obligations to her.”

He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.

“What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?”

“Her name’s Lady Ashley. Brett’s her own name. She’s a nice girl,” I
said. “She’s getting a divorce and she’s going to marry Mike Campbell.
He’s over in Scotland now. Why?”

“She’s a remarkably attractive woman.”

“Isn’t she?”

“There’s a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to
be absolutely fine and straight.”

“She’s very nice.”

“I don’t know how to describe the quality,” Cohn said. “I suppose it’s
breeding.”

“You sound as though you liked her pretty well.”

“I do. I shouldn’t wonder if I were in love with her.”

“She’s a drunk,” I said. “She’s in love with Mike Campbell, and she’s
going to marry him. He’s going to be rich as hell some day.”

“I don’t believe she’ll ever marry him.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t know. I just don’t believe it. Have you known her a long time?”

“Yes,” I said. “She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the
war.”

“She must have been just a kid then.”

“She’s thirty-four now.”

“When did she marry Ashley?”

“During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the
dysentery.”

“You talk sort of bitter.”

“Sorry. I didn’t mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.”

“I don’t believe she would marry anybody she didn’t love.”

“Well,” I said. “She’s done it twice.”

“I don’t believe it.”

“Well,” I said, “don’t ask me a lot of fool questions if you don’t like
the answers.”

“I didn’t ask you that.”

“You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.”

“I didn’t ask you to insult her.”

“Oh, go to hell.”

He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and
angry behind the little plates of hors d’œuvres.

“Sit down,” I said. “Don’t be a fool.”

“You’ve got to take that back.”

“Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.”

“Take it back.”

“Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How’s that?

“No. Not that. About me going to hell.”

“Oh, don’t go to hell,” I said. “Stick around. We’re just starting
lunch.”

Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the
hell would he have done if he hadn’t sat down? “You say such damned
insulting things, Jake.”

“I’m sorry. I’ve got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty
things.”

“I know it,” Cohn said. “You’re really about the best friend I have,
Jake.”

God help you, I thought. “Forget what I said,” I said out loud. “I’m
sorry.”

“It’s all right. It’s fine. I was just sore for a minute.”

“Good. Let’s get something else to eat.”

After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had
coffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him
off it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to
the office.




                                CHAPTER
                                   6


At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was
not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good
letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.
Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar
and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the
bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a
taxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges
being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the
sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was
always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.

The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in
doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let
that part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull
riding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between
Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and
dull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that
makes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris
as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking
down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read
something about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of
Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris.
Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men
get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.

The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in
Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank
of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it
will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the
sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside
at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of
saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.

“Sit down,” said Harvey, “I’ve been looking for you.”

“What’s the matter?”

“Nothing. Just looking for you.”

“Been out to the races?”

“No. Not since Sunday.”

“What do you hear from the States?”

“Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”

“What’s the matter?”

“I don’t know. I’m through with them. I’m absolutely through with them.”

He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.

“Do you want to know something, Jake?”

“Yes.”

“I haven’t had anything to eat for five days.”

I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had
won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.

“What’s the matter?”

“No money. Money hasn’t come,” he paused. “I tell you it’s strange,
Jake. When I’m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my
own room. I’m like a cat.”

I felt in my pocket.

“Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?”

“Yes.”

“Come on. Let’s go and eat.”

“There’s no hurry. Have a drink.”

“Better eat.”

“No. When I get like this I don’t care whether I eat or not.”

We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.

“Do you know Mencken, Harvey?”

“Yes. Why?”

“What’s he like?”

“He’s all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had
dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. ‘The trouble is,’ he said,
‘he’s a garter snapper.’ That’s not bad.”

“That’s not bad.”

“He’s through now,” Harvey went on. “He’s written about all the things
he knows, and now he’s on all the things he doesn’t know.”

“I guess he’s all right,” I said. “I just can’t read him.”

“Oh, nobody reads him now,” Harvey said, “except the people that used to
read the Alexander Hamilton Institute.”

“Well,” I said. “That was a good thing, too.”

“Sure,” said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.

“Have another port?”

“All right,” said Harvey.

“There comes Cohn,” I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.

“That moron,” said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.

“Hello, you bums,” he said.

“Hello, Robert,” Harvey said. “I was just telling Jake here that you’re
a moron.”

“What do you mean?”

“Tell us right off. Don’t think. What would you rather do if you could
do anything you wanted?”

Cohn started to consider.

“Don’t think. Bring it right out.”

“I don’t know,” Cohn said. “What’s it all about, anyway?”

“I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No
matter how silly it is.”

“I don’t know,” Cohn said. “I think I’d rather play football again with
what I know about handling myself, now.”

“I misjudged you,” Harvey said. “You’re not a moron. You’re only a case
of arrested development.”

“You’re awfully funny, Harvey,” Cohn said. “Some day somebody will push
your face in.”

Harvey Stone laughed. “You think so. They won’t, though. Because it
wouldn’t make any difference to me. I’m not a fighter.”

“It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.”

“No, it wouldn’t. That’s where you make your big mistake. Because you’re
not intelligent.”

“Cut it out about me.”

“Sure,” said Harvey. “It doesn’t make any difference to me. You don’t
mean anything to me.”

“Come on, Harvey,” I said. “Have another porto.”

“No,” he said. “I’m going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.”

He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street
through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.

“He always gets me sore,” Cohn said. “I can’t stand him.”

“I like him,” I said. “I’m fond of him. You don’t want to get sore at
him.”

“I know it,” Cohn said. “He just gets on my nerves.”

“Write this afternoon?”

“No. I couldn’t get it going. It’s harder to do than my first book. I’m
having a hard time handling it.”

The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America
early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only
with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone.
Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that
until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that
would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on
the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he
handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of
undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said
stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may
be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not
believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed
at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had
trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never
been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He
loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for
instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he
fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat
him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.

Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey
Stone had just crossed the street.

“Come on up to the Lilas,” I said.

“I have a date.”

“What time?”

“Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen.”

“There she is.”

Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a
very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and
smiled. We watched her cross the street.

“Hello,” she said, “I’m so glad you’re here, Jake. I’ve been wanting to
talk to you.”

“Hello, Frances,” said Cohn. He smiled.

“Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?” She went on, talking rapidly. “I’ve
had the darndest time. This one”—shaking her head at Cohn—“didn’t come
home for lunch.”

“I wasn’t supposed to.”

“Oh, I know. But you didn’t say anything about it to the cook. Then I
had a date myself, and Paula wasn’t at her office. I went to the Ritz
and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn’t have
enough money to lunch at the Ritz——”

“What did you do?”

“Oh, went out, of course.” She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful
manner. “I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I
ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?”

“Fine.”

“That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that
Brett one.”

“Don’t you like her?” Cohn asked.

“I think she’s perfectly charming. Don’t you?”

Cohn said nothing.

“Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the
Dome? You’ll stay here, won’t you, Robert? Come on, Jake.”

We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy
came up with the _Paris Times_, and I bought one and opened it.

“What’s the matter, Frances?”

“Oh, nothing,” she said, “except that he wants to leave me.”

“How do you mean?”

“Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my
mother and every one, and now he doesn’t want to do it.”

“What’s the matter?”

“He’s decided he hasn’t lived enough. I knew it would happen when he
went to New York.”

She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.

“I wouldn’t marry him if he doesn’t want to. Of course I wouldn’t. I
wouldn’t marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a
little late now, after we’ve waited three years, and I’ve just gotten my
divorce.”

I said nothing.

“We were going to celebrate so, and instead we’ve just had scenes. It’s
so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be
reasonable, but he says he just can’t do it.”

“It’s rotten luck.”

“I should say it is rotten luck. I’ve wasted two years and a half on him
now. And I don’t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two
years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the
old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy
about me. Now I don’t think I could get anybody.”

“Sure, you could marry anybody.”

“No, I don’t believe it. And I’m fond of him, too. And I’d like to have
children. I always thought we’d have children.”

She looked at me very brightly. “I never liked children much, but I
don’t want to think I’ll never have them. I always thought I’d have them
and then like them.”

“He’s got children.”

“Oh, yes. He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a rich
mother, and he’s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff;
nobody at all. It isn’t bad, either. And I haven’t got any money at all.
I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.”

She looked at me again very brightly.

“It isn’t right. It’s my own fault and it’s not, too. I ought to have
known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can’t marry.
Why can’t he marry? I’d be a good wife. I’m easy to get along with. I
leave him alone. It doesn’t do any good.”

“It’s a rotten shame.”

“Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there’s no use talking about it, is
there? Come on, let’s go back to the café.”

“And of course there isn’t anything I can do.”

“No. Just don’t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.” Now
for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. “He
wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out
so when a lot of little chickens like it. That’s what he wants.”

“Maybe they won’t like it. I don’t think he’s that way. Really.”

“You don’t know him like I do, Jake. That’s what he wants to do. I know
it. I know it. That’s why he doesn’t want to marry. He wants to have a
big triumph this fall all by himself.”

“Want to go back to the café?”

“Yes. Come on.”

We got up from the table—they had never brought us a drink—and started
across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from
behind the marble-topped table.

“Well, what are you smiling at?” Frances asked him. “Feel pretty happy?”

“I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.”

“Oh, what I’ve told Jake isn’t any secret. Everybody will know it soon
enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.”

“What was it? About your going to England?”

“Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I’m
going to England.”

“Isn’t that fine!”

“Yes, that’s the way it’s done in the very best families. Robert’s
sending me. He’s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I’m going
to visit friends. Won’t it be lovely? The friends don’t know about it,
yet.”

She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.

“You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren’t you, Robert?
But I made him give me two hundred. He’s really very generous. Aren’t
you, Robert?”

I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.
There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give
you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be
destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was
Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did
not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly
joking to what went on later.

“How can you say such things, Frances?” Cohn interrupted.

“Listen to him. I’m going to England. I’m going to visit friends. Ever
visit friends that didn’t want you? Oh, they’ll have to take me, all
right. ‘How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we’ve seen you.
And how is your dear mother?’ Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all
her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person
in the world that did. ‘And what about Robert?’ or else very careful
talking around Robert. ‘You must be most careful not to mention him, my
dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.’ Won’t it be
fun, Robert? Don’t you think it will be fun, Jake?”

She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very
satisfactory to her to have an audience for this.

“And where are you going to be, Robert? It’s my own fault, all right.
Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary
on the magazine I ought to have known you’d get rid of me the same way.
Jake doesn’t know about that. Should I tell him?”

“Shut up, Frances, for God’s sake.”

“Yes, I’ll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just
the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was
wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful,
too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to
Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn’t even
pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was
pretty fine, then. Didn’t you, Robert?

“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the
secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that
she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that
we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn’t that
literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.

“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren’t you,
Robert? That’s why he’s leaving me. He’s decided I don’t film well. You
see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing
on this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us. So now he’s
going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something
frightfully interesting.

“Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won’t mind, will
you? Don’t have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you
can’t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you
can’t remember what the other person’s said. You’ll never be able to
remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it’s
awfully hard. But remember, it’s for literature. We all ought to make
sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I’m going to England without a
protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don’t you
think so, Jake? But you’re not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You’re
thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at
Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert
doesn’t think he’s any good, though. Some of his French friends told
him. He doesn’t read French very well himself. He wasn’t a good writer
like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look
for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he
wouldn’t marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I’ve just thought of
something.” She put her gloved hand up to her lips. “I know the real
reason why Robert won’t marry me, Jake. It’s just come to me. They’ve
sent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn’t it mystic? Some day
they’ll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert?
I’ll tell you. It’s so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it.
Why, you see, Robert’s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he
doesn’t marry me, why, then he’s had one. She was his mistress for over
two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he’s always
promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don’t you
think that’s bright of me to figure that out? It’s true, too. Look at
him and see if it’s not. Where are you going, Jake?”

“I’ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.”

Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there?
Why did he keep on taking it like that?

As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the
window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into
his face each time she asked: “Isn’t it so, Robert?” Or maybe she did
not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I
did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I
went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and
saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side
street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave
the driver the address of my flat.




                                CHAPTER
                                   7


As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the
door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters
and a telegram.

“Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.”

“Did she leave a card?”

“No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night.
In the end I find she is very nice.”

“Was she with a friend of mine?”

“I don’t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very
large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps,
a little—” She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.
“I’ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her
not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to
what I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family.
It is a thing you can see.”

“They did not leave any word?”

“Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.”

“Send them up when they come.”

“Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An
eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu’une, quelqu’une!”

The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling
concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse,
but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great
pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were
of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the
accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall
into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was
no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely
underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither
well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter
asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could
come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.

I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.
The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the
_France_. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom,
undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the
door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.
It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of
roses.

“Hello, darling,” said Brett. “Aren’t you going to let us in?”

“Come on. I was just bathing.”

“Aren’t you the fortunate man. Bathing.”

“Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?”

“I don’t know whether you like flowers, sir,” the count said, “but I
took the liberty of just bringing these roses.”

“Here, give them to me.” Brett took them. “Get me some water in this,
Jake.” I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and
Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the
dining-room table.

“I say. We have had a day.”

“You don’t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?”

“No. Did we have one? I must have been blind.”

“You were quite drunk, my dear,” said the count.

“Wasn’t I, though? And the count’s been a brick, absolutely.”

“You’ve got hell’s own drag with the concierge now.”

“I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.”

“Don’t be a damned fool.”

“His,” she said, and nodded at the count.

“I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It
was very late.”

“He’s wonderful,” Brett said. “He remembers everything that’s happened.”

“So do you, my dear.”

“Fancy,” said Brett. “Who’d want to? I say, Jake, _do_ we get a drink?”

“You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.”

“Rather.”

While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and
then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt
tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand,
and sat on the bed.

“What’s the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?”

She kissed me coolly on the forehead.

“Oh, Brett, I love you so much.”

“Darling,” she said. Then: “Do you want me to send him away?”

“No. He’s nice.”

“I’ll send him away.”

“No, don’t.”

“Yes, I’ll send him away.”

“You can’t just like that.”

“Can’t I, though? You stay here. He’s mad about me, I tell you.”

She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a
bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and
sat on the bed.

“Poor old darling.” She stroked my head.

“What did you say to him?” I was lying with my face away from her. I did
not want to see her.

“Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.”

Then later: “Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?”

“It’s better.”

“Lie quiet. He’s gone to the other side of town.”

“Couldn’t we live together, Brett? Couldn’t we just live together?”

“I don’t think so. I’d just _tromper_ you with everybody. You couldn’t
stand it.”

“I stand it now.”

“That would be different. It’s my fault, Jake. It’s the way I’m made.”

“Couldn’t we go off in the country for a while?”

“It wouldn’t be any good. I’ll go if you like. But I couldn’t live
quietly in the country. Not with my own true love.”

“I know.”

“Isn’t it rotten? There isn’t any use my telling you I love you.”

“You know I love you.”

“Let’s not talk. Talking’s all bilge. I’m going away from you, and then
Michael’s coming back.”

“Why are you going away?”

“Better for you. Better for me.”

“When are you going?”

“Soon as I can.”

“Where?”

“San Sebastian.”

“Can’t we go together?”

“No. That would be a hell of an idea after we’d just talked it out.”

“We never agreed.”

“Oh, you know as well as I do. Don’t be obstinate, darling.”

“Oh, sure,” I said. “I know you’re right. I’m just low, and when I’m low
I talk like a fool.”

I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I
stood up.

“Don’t look like that, darling.”

“How do you want me to look?”

“Oh, don’t be a fool. I’m going away to-morrow.”

“To-morrow?”

“Yes. Didn’t I say so? I am.”

“Let’s have a drink, then. The count will be back.”

“Yes. He should be back. You know he’s extraordinary about buying
champagne. It means any amount to him.”

We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured
Brett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I
went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur
carrying a basket of champagne.

“Where should I have him put it, sir?” asked the count.

“In the kitchen,” Brett said.

“Put it in there, Henry,” the count motioned. “Now go down and get the
ice.” He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. “I
think you’ll find that’s very good wine,” he said. “I know we don’t get
much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this
from a friend of mine that’s in the business.”

“Oh, you always have some one in the trade,” Brett said.

“This fellow raises the grapes. He’s got thousands of acres of them.”

“What’s his name?” asked Brett. “Veuve Cliquot?”

“No,” said the count. “Mumms. He’s a baron.”

“Isn’t it wonderful,” said Brett. “We all have titles. Why haven’t you a
title, Jake?”

“I assure you, sir,” the count put his hand on my arm. “It never does a
man any good. Most of the time it costs you money.”

“Oh, I don’t know. It’s damned useful sometimes,” Brett said.

“I’ve never known it to do me any good.”

“You haven’t used it properly. I’ve had hell’s own amount of credit on
mine.”

“Do sit down, count,” I said. “Let me take that stick.”

The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She
was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me
notice it. “I say, Jake, I don’t want to ruin your rugs. Can’t you give
a chap an ash-tray?”

I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up
with a bucket full of salted ice. “Put two bottles in it, Henry,” the
count called.

“Anything else, sir?”

“No. Wait down in the car.” He turned to Brett and to me. “We’ll want to
ride out to the Bois for dinner?”

“If you like,” Brett said. “I couldn’t eat a thing.”

“I always like a good meal,” said the count.

“Should I bring the wine in, sir?” asked the chauffeur.

“Yes. Bring it in, Henry,” said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin
cigar-case and offered it to me. “Like to try a real American cigar?”

“Thanks,” I said. “I’ll finish the cigarette.”

He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of
his watch-chain.

“I like a cigar to really draw,” said the count “Half the cigars you
smoke don’t draw.”

He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. “And
when you’re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won’t have a title.”

“No. What a pity.”

“No,” said the count. “You don’t need a title. You got class all over
you.”

“Thanks. Awfully decent of you.”

“I’m not joking you,” the count blew a cloud of smoke. “You got the most
class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That’s all.”

“Nice of you,” said Brett. “Mummy would be pleased. Couldn’t you write
it out, and I’ll send it in a letter to her.”

“I’d tell her, too,” said the count. “I’m not joking you. I never joke
people. Joke people and you make enemies. That’s what I always say.”

“You’re right,” Brett said. “You’re terribly right. I always joke people
and I haven’t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.”

“You don’t joke him.”

“That’s it.”

“Do you, now?” asked the count. “Do you joke him?”

Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.

“No,” she said. “I wouldn’t joke him.”

“See,” said the count. “You don’t joke him.”

“This is a hell of a dull talk,” Brett said. “How about some of that
champagne?”

The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. “It
isn’t cold, yet. You’re always drinking, my dear. Why don’t you just
talk?”

“I’ve talked too ruddy much. I’ve talked myself all out to Jake.”

“I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you
never finish your sentences at all.”

“Leave ’em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.”

“It is a very interesting system,” the count reached down and gave the
bottles a twirl. “Still I would like to hear you talk some time.”

“Isn’t he a fool?” Brett asked.

“Now,” the count brought up a bottle. “I think this is cool.”

I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. “I like to
drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been
too hard to cool.” He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the
glasses.

“I say. You might open it,” Brett suggested.

“Yes, my dear. Now I’ll open it.”

It was amazing champagne.

“I say that is wine,” Brett held up her glass. “We ought to toast
something. ‘Here’s to royalty.’”

“This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don’t want to
mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.”

Brett’s glass was empty.

“You ought to write a book on wines, count,” I said.

“Mr. Barnes,” answered the count, “all I want out of wines is to enjoy
them.”

“Let’s enjoy a little more of this,” Brett pushed her glass forward. The
count poured very carefully. “There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly,
and then you can get drunk.”

“Drunk? Drunk?”

“My dear, you are charming when you are drunk.”

“Listen to the man.”

“Mr. Barnes,” the count poured my glass full. “She is the only lady I
have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was
sober.”

“You haven’t been around much, have you?”

“Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very
great deal.”

“Drink your wine,” said Brett. “We’ve all been around. I dare say Jake
here has seen as much as you have.”

“My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don’t think I don’t think
so, sir. I have seen a lot, too.”

“Of course you have, my dear,” Brett said. “I was only ragging.”

“I have been in seven wars and four revolutions,” the count said.

“Soldiering?” Brett asked.

“Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen
arrow wounds?”

“Let’s have a look at them.”

The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled
up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big
stomach muscles bulging under the light.

“You see them?”

Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. “See
on the back where they come out.” Above the small of the back were the
same two scars, raised as thick as a finger.

“I say. Those are something.”

“Clean through.”

The count was tucking in his shirt.

“Where did you get those?” I asked.

“In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.”

“What were you doing?” asked Brett. “Were you in the army?”

“I was on a business trip, my dear.”

“I told you he was one of us. Didn’t I?” Brett turned to me. “I love
you, count. You’re a darling.”

“You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn’t true.”

“Don’t be an ass.”

“You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I
can enjoy everything so well. Don’t you find it like that?”

“Yes. Absolutely.”

“I know,” said the count. “That is the secret. You must get to know the
values.”

“Doesn’t anything ever happen to your values?” Brett asked.

“No. Not any more.”

“Never fall in love?”

“Always,” said the count. “I am always in love.”

“What does that do to your values?”

“That, too, has got a place in my values.”

“You haven’t any values. You’re dead, that’s all.”

“No, my dear. You’re not right. I’m not dead at all.”

We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in
my kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner.
Food had an excellent place in the count’s values. So did wine. The
count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good
party.

“Where would you like to go?” asked the count after dinner. We were the
only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over
against the door. They wanted to go home.

“We might go up on the hill,” Brett said. “Haven’t we had a splendid
party?”

The count was beaming. He was very happy.

“You are very nice people,” he said. He was smoking a cigar again. “Why
don’t you get married, you two?”

“We want to lead our own lives,” I said.

“We have our careers,” Brett said. “Come on. Let’s get out of this.”

“Have another brandy,” the count said.

“Get it on the hill.”

“No. Have it here where it is quiet.”

“You and your quiet,” said Brett. “What is it men feel about quiet?”

“We like it,” said the count. “Like you like noise, my dear.”

“All right,” said Brett. “Let’s have one.”

“Sommelier!” the count called.

“Yes, sir.”

“What is the oldest brandy you have?”

“Eighteen eleven, sir.”

“Bring us a bottle.”

“I say. Don’t be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.”

“Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in
any other antiquities.”

“Got many antiquities?”

“I got a houseful.”

Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli’s it was crowded, smoky,
and noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was
so crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We
were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him.

“Hahre you?”

“Great.”

“Thaats good.”

He was all teeth and lips.

“He’s a great friend of mine,” Brett said. “Damn good drummer.”

The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat.
Then the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He
was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again.

“Let’s go over.”

Brett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced,
tight in the crowd.

“You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael’s the best dancer I know.”

“He’s splendid.”

“He’s got his points.”

“I like him,” I said. “I’m damned fond of him.”

“I’m going to marry him,” Brett said. “Funny. I haven’t thought about
him for a week.”

“Don’t you write him?”

“Not I. Never write letters.”

“I’ll bet he writes to you.”

“Rather. Damned good letters, too.”

“When are you going to get married?”

“How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael’s trying to
get his mother to put up for it.”

“Could I help you?”

“Don’t be an ass. Michael’s people have loads of money.”

The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up.

“Very nice,” he said. “You looked very, very nice.”

“Don’t you dance, count?” I asked.

“No. I’m too old.”

“Oh, come off it,” Brett said.

“My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you
dance.”

“Splendid,” Brett said. “I’ll dance again for you some time. I say. What
about your little friend, Zizi?”

“Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don’t want to have him
around.”

“He is rather hard.”

“You know I think that boy’s got a future. But personally I don’t want
him around.”

“Jake’s rather the same way.”

“He gives me the willys.”

“Well,” the count shrugged his shoulders. “About his future you can’t
ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.”

“Come on. Let’s dance,” Brett said.

We danced. It was crowded and close.

“Oh, darling,” Brett said, “I’m so miserable.”

I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened
before. “You were happy a minute ago.”

The drummer shouted: “You can’t two time—”

“It’s all gone.”

“What’s the matter?”

“I don’t know. I just feel terribly.”

“. . . . . .” the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks.

“Want to go?”

I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated,
something I had been through and that now I must go through again.

“. . . . . .” the drummer sang softly.

“Let’s go,” said Brett. “You don’t mind.”

“. . . . . .” the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.

“All right,” I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the
dressing-room.

“Brett wants to go,” I said to the count. He nodded. “Does she? That’s
fine. You take the car. I’m going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes.”

We shook hands.

“It was a wonderful time,” I said. “I wish you would let me get this.” I
took a note out of my pocket.

“Mr. Barnes, don’t be ridiculous,” the count said.

Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand
on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I
looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big
car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.

“No, don’t come up,” she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door
was unlatched.

“Really?”

“No. Please.”

“Good night, Brett,” I said. “I’m sorry you feel rotten.”

“Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won’t see you again.” We
kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. “Oh,
don’t!” Brett said.

She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me
around to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and
said: “Good night, sir,” and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened
and I went up-stairs and went to bed.

                                CHAPTER
                                   8


I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One
card came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said:
“Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT.”

Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England
and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a
couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to
the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach
him always, he wrote, through his bankers.

Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn’s troubles, I rather enjoyed
not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often
to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the
office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my
secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of
June. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went
off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful.
New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a
whole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good
prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very
happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to
make a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he
went off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave
for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He
wrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: “Jake,
Budapest is wonderful.” Then I got a wire: “Back on Monday.”

Monday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went
to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying
his bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags.

“Well,” I said, “I hear you had a wonderful trip.”

“Wonderful,” he said. “Budapest is absolutely wonderful.”

“How about Vienna?”

“Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was.”

“How do you mean?” I was getting glasses and a siphon.

“Tight, Jake. I was tight.”

“That’s strange. Better have a drink.”

Bill rubbed his forehead. “Remarkable thing,” he said. “Don’t know how
it happened. Suddenly it happened.”

“Last long?”

“Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days.”

“Where did you go?”

“Don’t remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.”

“Do anything else?”

“Not so sure. Possible.”

“Go on. Tell me about it.”

“Can’t remember. Tell you anything I could remember.”

“Go on. Take that drink and remember.”

“Might remember a little,” Bill said. “Remember something about a
prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember
the nigger perfectly.”

“Go on.”

“Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big.
All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger’d just
knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a
speech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local
white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody
commenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn’t
get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big
sporting evening.”

“What happened?”

“Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get
his money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall.
Wonder who translated? Was it me?”

“Probably it wasn’t you.”

“You’re right. Wasn’t me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him
the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.”

“How’d you come out?”

“Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger
promised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can’t
knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. ‘My God, Mister Gorton,’ said nigger, ‘I
didn’t do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay.
That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit
him.’”

“Did you get any money?”

“No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger’s clothes. Somebody took
his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not
so good, Jake. Not so good.”

“What became of the nigger?”

“Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to
write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger.
Hope I gave him the right address.”

“You probably did.”

“Well, anyway, let’s eat,” said Bill. “Unless you want me to tell you
some more travel stories.”

“Go on.”

“Let’s eat.”

We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm
June evening.

“Where will we go?”

“Want to eat on the island?”

“Sure.”

We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue
Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing
robes.

“I know who they are.” Bill eyed the monument. “Gentlemen who invented
pharmacy. Don’t try and fool me on Paris.”

We went on.

“Here’s a taxidermist’s,” Bill said. “Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed
dog?”

“Come on,” I said. “You’re pie-eyed.”

“Pretty nice stuffed dogs,” Bill said. “Certainly brighten up your
flat.”

“Come on.”

“Just one stuffed dog. I can take ’em or leave ’em alone. But listen,
Jake. Just one stuffed dog.”

“Come on.”

“Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple
exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.”

“We’ll get one on the way back.”

“All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought
stuffed dogs. Not my fault.”

We went on.

“How’d you feel that way about dogs so sudden?”

“Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed
animals.”

We stopped and had a drink.

“Certainly like to drink,” Bill said. “You ought to try it some times,
Jake.”

“You’re about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.”

“Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never
been daunted. Never been daunted in public.”

“Where were you drinking?”

“Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George’s
a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.”

“You’ll be daunted after about three more pernods.”

“Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I’ll go off by myself. I’m
like a cat that way.”

“When did you see Harvey Stone?”

“At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn’t eaten for
three days. Doesn’t eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.”

“He’s all right.”

“Splendid. Wish he wouldn’t keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me
nervous.”

“What’ll we do to-night?”

“Doesn’t make any difference. Only let’s not get daunted. Suppose they
got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we
wouldn’t have to go all the way down to the island to eat.”

“Nix,” I said. “We’re going to have a regular meal.”

“Just a suggestion,” said Bill. “Want to start now?”

“Come on.”

We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill
looked at it.

“See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for
Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I’m a
nature-writer.”

A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop.
The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett.

“Beautiful lady,” said Bill. “Going to kidnap us.”

“Hullo!” Brett said. “Hullo!”

“This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley.”

Brett smiled at Bill. “I say I’m just back. Haven’t bathed even. Michael
comes in to-night.”

“Good. Come on and eat with us, and we’ll all go to meet him.”

“Must clean myself.”

“Oh, rot! Come on.”

“Must bathe. He doesn’t get in till nine.”

“Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe.”

“Might do that. Now you’re not talking rot.”

We got in the taxi. The driver looked around.

“Stop at the nearest bistro,” I said.

“We might as well go to the Closerie,” Brett said. “I can’t drink these
rotten brandies.”

“Closerie des Lilas.”

Brett turned to Bill.

“Have you been in this pestilential city long?”

“Just got in to-day from Budapest.”

“How was Budapest?”

“Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful.”

“Ask him about Vienna.”

“Vienna,” said Bill, “is a strange city.”

“Very much like Paris,” Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of
her eyes.

“Exactly,” Bill said. “Very much like Paris at this moment.”

“You _have_ a good start.”

Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and
soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.

“How are you, Jake?”

“Great,” I said. “I’ve had a good time.”

Brett looked at me. “I was a fool to go away,” she said. “One’s an ass
to leave Paris.”

“Did you have a good time?”

“Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.”

“See anybody?”

“No, hardly anybody. I never went out.”

“Didn’t you swim?”

“No. Didn’t do a thing.”

“Sounds like Vienna,” Bill said.

Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.

“So that’s the way it was in Vienna.”

“It was like everything in Vienna.”

Brett smiled at him again.

“You’ve a nice friend, Jake.”

“He’s all right,” I said. “He’s a taxidermist.”

“That was in another country,” Bill said. “And besides all the animals
were dead.”

“One more,” Brett said, “and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi.”

“There’s a line of them. Right out in front.”

“Good.”

We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi.

“Mind you’re at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be
there.”

“We’ll be there,” Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved.

“Quite a girl,” Bill said. “She’s damned nice. Who’s Michael?”

“The man she’s going to marry.”

“Well, well,” Bill said. “That’s always just the stage I meet anybody.
What’ll I send them? Think they’d like a couple of stuffed race-horses?”

“We better eat.”

“Is she really Lady something or other?” Bill asked in the taxi on our
way down to the Ile Saint Louis.

“Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.”

“Well, well.”

We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte’s restaurant on the far side of the
island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait
for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women’s Club list as a
quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so
we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the
restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte
made a great fuss over seeing him.

“Doesn’t get us a table, though,” Bill said. “Grand woman, though.”

We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a
salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.

“You’ve got the world here all right,” Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She
raised her hand. “Oh, my God!”

“You’ll be rich.”

“I hope so.”

After the coffee and a _fine_ we got the bill, chalked up the same as
ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the “quaint” features, paid
it, shook hands, and went out.

“You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,” Madame Lecomte said.

“Too many compatriots.”

“Come at lunch-time. It’s not crowded then.”

“Good. I’ll be down soon.”

We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai
d’Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of
old houses that were being torn down.

“They’re going to cut a street through.”

“They would,” Bill said.

We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau
mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out
of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting
against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the
wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge
and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the
island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees
were shadows.

“It’s pretty grand,” Bill said. “God, I love to get back.”

We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to
the lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It
made no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed
us. They were walking with their arms around each other.

We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was
steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The
arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and
underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the
door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I
saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were
drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking
potato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some
onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in
one hand.

“Want to have a drink?”

“No,” said Bill. “I don’t need it.”

We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth
narrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses
jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue
du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid
north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val
de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the
Boulevard du Port Royal.

“What do you want to do?” I asked. “Go up to the café and see Brett and
Mike?”

“Why not?”

We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on
past the Lilas, Lavigne’s, and all the little cafés, Damoy’s, crossed
the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.

Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and
healthy-looking.

“Hel-lo, Jake,” he said. “Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?”

“You look very fit, Mike.”

“Oh, I am. I’m frightfully fit. I’ve done nothing but walk. Walk all day
long. One drink a day with my mother at tea.”

Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was
sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on.

“It’s good to see you, Jake,” Michael said. “I’m a little tight you
know. Amazing, isn’t it? Did you see my nose?”

There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.

“An old lady’s bags did that,” Mike said. “I reached up to help her with
them and they fell on me.”

Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and
wrinkled the corners of her eyes.

“An old lady,” said Mike. “Her bags _fell_ on me. Let’s go in and see
Brett. I say, she is a piece. You _are_ a lovely lady, Brett. Where did
you get that hat?”

“Chap bought it for me. Don’t you like it?”

“It’s a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat.”

“Oh, we’ve so much money now,” Brett said. “I say, haven’t you met Bill
yet? You _are_ a lovely host, Jake.”

She turned to Mike. “This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike
Campbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.”

“Aren’t I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London.
Chap who did me in.”

“What did he say?”

“Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you
_are_ a lovely piece. Don’t you think she’s beautiful?”

“Beautiful. With this nose?”

“It’s a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn’t she a lovely piece?”

“Couldn’t we have kept the man in Scotland?”

“I say, Brett, let’s turn in early.”

“Don’t be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar.”

“Isn’t she a lovely piece? Don’t you think so, Jake?”

“There’s a fight to-night,” Bill said. “Like to go?”

“Fight,” said Mike. “Who’s fighting?”

“Ledoux and somebody.”

“He’s very good, Ledoux,” Mike said. “I’d like to see it, rather”—he
was making an effort to pull himself together—“but I can’t go. I had a
date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat.”

Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from
under it. “You two run along to the fight. I’ll have to be taking Mr.
Campbell home directly.”

“I’m not tight,” Mike said. “Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you
are a lovely piece.”

“Go on to the fight,” Brett said. “Mr. Campbell’s getting difficult.
What are these outbursts of affection, Michael?”

“I say, you are a lovely piece.”

We said good night. “I’m sorry I can’t go,” Mike said. Brett laughed. I
looked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning
toward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the
corners of her eyes were smiling.

Outside on the pavement I said: “Do you want to go to the fight?”

“Sure,” said Bill. “If we don’t have to walk.”

“Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend,” I said in the taxi.

“Well,” said Bill. “You can’t blame him such a hell of a lot.”




                                CHAPTER
                                   9


The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a
good fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn,
written from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing,
playing some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he
was anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I
would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.

That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would
leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him
at Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The
same evening about seven o’clock I stopped in at the Select to see
Michael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo.
They were inside sitting at the bar.

“Hello, darling.” Brett put out her hand.

“Hello, Jake,” Mike said. “I understand I was tight last night.”

“Weren’t you, though,” Brett said. “Disgraceful business.”

“Look,” said Mike, “when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we
came down with you?”

“It would be grand.”

“You wouldn’t mind, really? I’ve been at Pamplona, you know. Brett’s mad
to go. You’re sure we wouldn’t just be a bloody nuisance?”

“Don’t talk like a fool.”

“I’m a little tight, you know. I wouldn’t ask you like this if I
weren’t. You’re sure you don’t mind?”

“Oh, shut up, Michael,” Brett said. “How can the man say he’d mind now?
I’ll ask him later.”

“But you don’t mind, do you?”

“Don’t ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go
down on the morning of the 25th.”

“By the way, where is Bill?” Brett asked.

“He’s out at Chantilly dining with some people.”

“He’s a good chap.”

“Splendid chap,” said Mike. “He is, you know.”

“You don’t remember him,” Brett said.

“I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we’ll come down the night of
the 25th. Brett can’t get up in the morning.”

“Indeed not!”

“If our money comes and you’re sure you don’t mind.”

“It will come, all right. I’ll see to that.”

“Tell me what tackle to send for.”

“Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies.”

“I won’t fish,” Brett put in.

“Get two rods, then, and Bill won’t have to buy one.”

“Right,” said Mike. “I’ll send a wire to the keeper.”

“Won’t it be splendid,” Brett said. “Spain! We _will_ have fun.”

“The 25th. When is that?”

“Saturday.”

“We _will_ have to get ready.”

“I say,” said Mike, “I’m going to the barber’s.”

“I must bathe,” said Brett. “Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a
good chap.”

“We _have_ got the loveliest hotel,” Mike said. “I think it’s a
brothel!”

“We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at
this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed
frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.”

“_I_ believe it’s a brothel,” Mike said. “And _I_ should know.”

“Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut.”

Mike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar.

“Have another?”

“Might.”

“I needed that,” Brett said.

We walked up the Rue Delambre.

“I haven’t seen you since I’ve been back,” Brett said.

“No.”

“How _are_ you, Jake?”

“Fine.”

Brett looked at me. “I say,” she said, “is Robert Cohn going on this
trip?”

“Yes. Why?”

“Don’t you think it will be a bit rough on him?”

“Why should it?”

“Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?”

“Congratulations,” I said.

We walked along.

“What did you say that for?”

“I don’t know. What would you like me to say?”

We walked along and turned a corner.

“He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull.”

“Does he?”

“I rather thought it would be good for him.”

“You might take up social service.”

“Don’t be nasty.”

“I won’t.”

“Didn’t you really know?”

“No,” I said. “I guess I didn’t think about it.”

“Do you think it will be too rough on him?”

“That’s up to him,” I said. “Tell him you’re coming. He can always not
come.”

“I’ll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it.”

I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June.

“Did you hear from Cohn?”

“Rather. He’s keen about it.”

“My God!”

“I thought it was rather odd myself.”

“Says he can’t wait to see me.”

“Does he think you’re coming alone?”

“No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all.”

“He’s wonderful.”

“Isn’t he?”

They expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona.
They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there.
We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on
Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the
mountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an
itinerary so they could follow us.

Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d’Orsay. It was a lovely
day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went
back into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked
the conductor for tickets for the first service.

“Nothing until the fifth.”

“What’s this?”

There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and
always plenty of places for both of them.

“They’re all reserved,” the dining-car conductor said. “There will be a
fifth service at three-thirty.”

“This is serious,” I said to Bill.

“Give him ten francs.”

“Here,” I said. “We want to eat in the first service.”

The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket.

“Thank you,” he said. “I would advise you gentlemen to get some
sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at
the office of the company.”

“You’ll go a long way, brother,” Bill said to him in English. “I suppose
if I’d given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the
train.”

“_Comment?_”

“Go to hell!” said Bill. “Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine.
You tell him, Jake.”

“And send it up to the next car.” I described where we were.

In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son.

“I suppose you’re Americans, aren’t you?” the man asked. “Having a good
trip?”

“Wonderful,” said Bill.

“That’s what you want to do. Travel while you’re young. Mother and I
always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while.”

“You could have come over ten years ago, if you’d wanted to,” the wife
said. “What you always said was: ‘See America first!’ I will say we’ve
seen a good deal, take it one way and another.”

“Say, there’s plenty of Americans on this train,” the husband said.
“They’ve got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They’ve been on a
pilgrimage to Rome, and now they’re going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.”

“So, that’s what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,” Bill said.

“What part of the States you boys from?”

“Kansas City,” I said. “He’s from Chicago.”

“You both going to Biarritz?”

“No. We’re going fishing in Spain.”

“Well, I never cared for it, myself. There’s plenty that do out where I
come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of
Montana. I’ve been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.”

“Mighty little fishing you did on them trips,” his wife said.

He winked at us.

“You know how the ladies are. If there’s a jug goes along, or a case of
beer, they think it’s hell and damnation.”

“That’s the way men are,” his wife said to us. She smoothed her
comfortable lap. “I voted against prohibition to please him, and because
I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It’s a
wonder they ever find any one to marry them.”

“Say,” said Bill, “do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have
cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?”

“How do you mean? They can’t do a thing like that.”

“You try and get seats.”

“Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another
breakfast.”

She stood up and straightened her dress.

“Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.”

They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after
they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and
pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our
friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor
with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.

“You’re going to work to-day,” I said.

He nodded his head. “They start now, at ten-thirty.”

“When do we eat?”

“Huh! When do I eat?”

He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches
and tipped him.

“I’ll get the plates,” he said, “or bring them with you.”

We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out
of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were
full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees,
and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.

At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got
back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his
son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.

“Is there good swimming in Biarritz?” asked Hubert.

“That boy’s just crazy till he can get in the water,” his mother said.
“It’s pretty hard on youngsters travelling.”

“There’s good swimming,” I said. “But it’s dangerous when it’s rough.”

“Did you get a meal?” Bill asked.

“We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they
must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said
something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.”

“They thought we were snappers, all right,” the man said. “It certainly
shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It’s a pity you boys ain’t
Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.”

“I am,” I said. “That’s what makes me so sore.”

Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather
difficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with
one of the returning streams of pilgrims.

“When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?”

“I don’t know anything about it. Haven’t you got tickets?”

“It’s enough to make a man join the Klan,” Bill said. The priest looked
back at him.

Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table
d’hôte meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white
jacket was purple under the arms.

“He must drink a lot of wine.”

“Or wear purple undershirts.”

“Let’s ask him.”

“No. He’s too tired.”

The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through
the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town.
Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There
were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them
like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had
dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It
was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings
with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got
dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the
window, and about nine o’clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife
and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to
change for Biarritz.

“Well, I hope you have lots of luck,” he said.

“Be careful about those bull-fights.”

“Maybe we’ll see you at Biarritz,” Hubert said.

We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark
station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses.
There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see
us at first. Then he started forward.

“Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?”

“Fine,” I said. “This is Bill Gorton.”

“How are you?”

“Come on,” said Robert. “I’ve got a cab.” He was a little near-sighted.
I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make
him out. He was shy, too.

“We’ll go up to my hotel. It’s all right. It’s quite nice.”

We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside
him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark
bridge and into the town.

“I’m awfully glad to meet you,” Robert said to Bill. “I’ve heard so much
about you from Jake and I’ve read your books. Did you get my line,
Jake?”

The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It
was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we
each had a good small room.




                                CHAPTER
                                   10


In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of
the town, and we all had breakfast in a café. Bayonne is a nice town. It
is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so
early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We
walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.

I was not at all sure Mike’s rods would come from Scotland in time, so
we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs
over a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had
to wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty
good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.

We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn
made some remark about it being a very good example of something or
other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim,
like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the
local Syndicat d’Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start
from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of
July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a
motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the
corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was
to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café
on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot,
but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant
sitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that
the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the
houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the
café. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the
bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went
up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with
ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and
waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the
parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed
him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just
come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.

Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big,
closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs,
and we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we
started off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely
gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in
the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We
passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the
road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the
Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and
villages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and
on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on
the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against
them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the
road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close
along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back
toward the sea. You couldn’t see the sea. It was too far away. You could
see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.

We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge,
and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short
guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in
kepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in
and looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of
the line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the
car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any
trout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it
did not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if
there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not
many.

I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn’t care for
it.

Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes
that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up
to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on
his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.

The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without
saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.

“What’s the matter with the old one?” I asked.

“He hasn’t got any passport.”

I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.

“What will he do?” I asked.

The guard spat in the dust.

“Oh, he’ll just wade across the stream.”

“Do you have much smuggling?”

“Oh,” he said, “they go through.”

The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the
inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the
white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had
been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road
winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There
were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of
beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit
of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow
up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in
the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest,
and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were
grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went
through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed
up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road
ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to
the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.

After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along
both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the
road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little
rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings
close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and
shifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned
around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head.
Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right
shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you
could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls
of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of
the other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every
way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched
out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.

We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road
slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then
levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside
the old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and
concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side
street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.

The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids
watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and
the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun
and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the
square. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good
rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and
went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for
lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.

There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the
second floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor
below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back
street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early
in the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the
down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in
Spain was always a shock with the hors d’œuvres, an egg course, two meat
courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink
plenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not
want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him,
and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate
of cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had
met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him
at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.

“Well,” I said, “Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night.”

“I’m not sure they’ll come,” Cohn said.

“Why not?” Bill said. “Of course they’ll come.”

“They’re always late,” I said.

“I rather think they’re not coming,” Robert Cohn said.

He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.

“I’ll bet you fifty pesetas they’re here to-night,” Bill said. He always
bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly.

“I’ll take it,” Cohn said. “Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas.”

“I’ll remember it myself,” Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to
smooth him down.

“It’s a sure thing they’ll come,” I said. “But maybe not to-night.”

“Want to call it off?” Cohn asked.

“No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like.”

“All right. I’ll take that.”

“That’s enough,” I said. “Or you’ll have to make a book and give me some
of it.”

“I’m satisfied,” Cohn said. He smiled. “You’ll probably win it back at
bridge, anyway.”

“You haven’t got it yet,” Bill said.

We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Iruña for
coffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.

“Say,” Bill said to me, “have I got any chance on that bet?”

“You’ve got a rotten chance. They’ve never been on time anywhere. If
their money doesn’t come it’s a cinch they won’t get in to-night.”

“I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He’s
all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and
Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here.”

I saw Cohn coming over across the square.

“Here he comes.”

“Well, let him not get superior and Jewish.”

“The barber shop’s closed,” Cohn said. “It’s not open till four.”

We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking
out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill
went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was
still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I
sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It
was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went
through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to
the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the
bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent
him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was
the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That
has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize
door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among
the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and
as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to
brush off my coat.

“You must have been in a motor-car,” he said.

The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray
with dust.

“From Bayonne.”

“Well, well,” he said. “I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the
dust was.” So I gave him two copper coins.

At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it.
The first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked
it now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up,
and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were
some wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for
everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and
myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and
lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was
praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the
bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that
we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might
pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed
that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I
would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count,
and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn’t seen
him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told
me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the
wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a
little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but
realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while,
and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only
wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was
out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers
and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in
the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some
buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.

At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had
a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair
afterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to
help him any. The train was due in at nine o’clock from San Sebastian,
and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty
minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from
the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with
him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave
his dinner. I said we would be right back.

We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn’s nervousness. I hoped
Brett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we
sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen
a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn—nor as eager. I was
enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a
wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.

After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side
of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We
went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of
the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started
coming out through the gates.

They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through
and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were
walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.

“I knew they wouldn’t come,” Robert said. We were going back to the
hotel.

“I thought they might,” I said.

Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine.

“Didn’t come, eh?”

“No.”

“Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?”
Bill asked. “I haven’t changed any money here yet.”

“Oh, forget about it,” Robert Cohn said. “Let’s bet on something else.
Can you bet on bull-fights?”

“You could,” Bill said, “but you don’t need to.”

“It would be like betting on the war,” I said. “You don’t need any
economic interest.”

“I’m very curious to see them,” Robert said.

Montoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. “It’s for
you.” He handed it to me.

It read: “Stopped night San Sebastian.”

“It’s from them,” I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should
have handed it over.

“They’ve stopped over in San Sebastian,” I said. “Send their regards to
you.”

Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know.
I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact
that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly
did hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that
little spell of superiority at lunch—that and when he went through all
that barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to
me, anyway.

“Well,” I said. “We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They
can follow us if they get in to-morrow night.”

There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train
and the one we had just met.

“That sounds like a good idea,” Cohn said.

“The sooner we get on the stream the better.”

“It’s all one to me when we start,” Bill said. “The sooner the better.”

We sat in the Iruña for a while and had coffee and then took a little
walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at
the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I
turned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I
believe, because I was asleep when they came in.

In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was
scheduled to leave at two o’clock. There was nothing earlier. I was
sitting over at the Iruña reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn
coming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of
the wicker chairs.

“This is a comfortable café,” he said. “Did you have a good night,
Jake?”

“I slept like a log.”

“I didn’t sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too.”

“Where were you?”

“Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café. The old man
there speaks German and English.”

“The Café Suizo.”

“That’s it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it’s a better café
than this one.”

“It’s not so good in the daytime,” I said. “Too hot. By the way, I got
the bus tickets.”

“I’m not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead.”

“I’ve got your ticket.”

“Give it to me. I’ll get the money back.”

“It’s five pesetas.”

Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me.

“I ought to stay,” he said. “You see I’m afraid there’s some sort of
misunderstanding.”

“Why,” I said. “They may not come here for three or four days now if
they start on parties at San Sebastian.”

“That’s just it,” said Robert. “I’m afraid they expected to meet me at
San Sebastian, and that’s why they stopped over.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett.”

“Why in hell didn’t you stay there and meet them then?” I started to
say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but
I do not believe it ever did.

He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able
to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between
him and Brett.

“Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch,” I said.

“I wish I could go. We’ve been looking forward to this fishing all
winter.” He was being sentimental about it. “But I ought to stay. I
really ought. As soon as they come I’ll bring them right up.”

“Let’s find Bill.”

“I want to go over to the barber-shop.”

“See you at lunch.”

I found Bill up in his room. He was shaving.

“Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night,” Bill said. “He’s a great
little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian.”

“The lying bastard!”

“Oh, no,” said Bill. “Don’t get sore. Don’t get sore at this stage of
the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?”

“Don’t rub it in.”

Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the
mirror while he lathered his face.

“Didn’t you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank
God, I’m a travelling man. Haven’t you got some more Jewish friends you
could bring along?” He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and
then started scraping again.

“You’ve got some fine ones yourself.”

“Oh, yes. I’ve got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn.
The funny thing is he’s nice, too. I like him. But he’s just so awful.”

“He can be damn nice.”

“I know it. That’s the terrible part.”

I laughed.

“Yes. Go on and laugh,” said Bill. “You weren’t out with him last night
until two o’clock.”

“Was he very bad?”

“Awful. What’s all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have
anything to do with him?”

He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side.

“Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.”

“What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?”

“She wanted to get out of town and she can’t go anywhere alone. She said
she thought it would be good for him.”

“What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn’t she go off with some of
her own people? Or you?”—he slurred that over—“or me? Why not me?” He
looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on
each cheek-bone. “It’s an honest face. It’s a face any woman would be
safe with.”

“She’d never seen it.”

“She should have. All women should see it. It’s a face that ought to be
thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a
copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their
daughters about this face. My son”—he pointed the razor at me—“go west
with this face and grow up with the country.”

He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some
alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down
his long upper lip.

“My God!” he said, “isn’t it an awful face?”

He looked in the glass.

“And as for this Robert Cohn,” Bill said, “he makes me sick, and he can
go to hell, and I’m damn glad he’s staying here so we won’t have him
fishing with us.”

“You’re damn right.”

“We’re going trout-fishing. We’re going trout-fishing in the Irati
River, and we’re going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the
country, and then take a swell bus ride.”

“Come on. Let’s go over to the Iruña and start,” I said.




                                CHAPTER
                                   11


It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our
bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus,
and others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside
Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a
couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was
crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top,
and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot.
Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one
wooden seat that ran across the top.

Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start. A
Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the
bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the
wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he
imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I
spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made
me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it
fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it.
The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not
getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man
waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at
lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long
drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one
took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it
away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They
were peasants going up into the hills.

Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert
Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As
soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt
nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast
and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust
powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through
the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The
Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the
wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.

“Pretty nice, eh?”

“These Basques are swell people,” Bill said.

The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather.
He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his
tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill
handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and
handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand.
He shoved the wine-bag up.

“Arriba! Arriba!” he said. “Lift it up.”

Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into
his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the
leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.

“No! No!” several Basques said. “Not like that.” One snatched the bottle
away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He
was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms’ length and
raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream
of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine
making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing
smoothly and regularly.

“Hey!” the owner of the bottle shouted. “Whose wine is that?”

The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his
eyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the
wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner
shook the wine-skin sadly.

We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the
driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside
the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming
country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The
grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a
wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose
under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into
the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only
patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the
water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give
room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the
other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and
the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of
mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero
driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we
passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky
and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.

We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a
sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and
fields of grapes touched the houses.

The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got
down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under
the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into
the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and
hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes
and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging
from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long
wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were
shelves stacked with supplies and goods.

We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I
gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the
copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.

Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they
bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on
the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went
out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus.
There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the
Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman
who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and
talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two
flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we
started off.

The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills
again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man
leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English:
“You’re Americans?”

“Sure.”

“I been there,” he said. “Forty years ago.”

He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white
beard.

“How was it?”

“What you say?”

“How was America?”

“Oh, I was in California. It was fine.”

“Why did you leave?”

“What you say?”

“Why did you come back here?”

“Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she
don’t like to travel. Where you from?”

“Kansas City.”

“I been there,” he said. “I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City,
Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.”

He named them carefully.

“How long were you over?”

“Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married.”

“Have a drink?”

“All right,” he said. “You can’t get this in America, eh?”

“There’s plenty if you can pay for it.”

“What you come over here for?”

“We’re going to the fiesta at Pamplona.”

“You like the bull-fights?”

“Sure. Don’t you?”

“Yes,” he said. “I guess I like them.”

Then after a little:

“Where you go now?”

“Up to Burguete to fish.”

“Well,” he said, “I hope you catch something.”

He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other
Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me
when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking
American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.

The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks
stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking
back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were
squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the
brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the
horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see
other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the
crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork
oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were
cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the
road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a
rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like
the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded
and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched
off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the
trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the
north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white
houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the
shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of
the monastery of Roncesvalles.

“There’s Roncevaux,” I said.

“Where?”

“Way off there where the mountain starts.”

“It’s cold up here,” Bill said.

“It’s high,” I said. “It must be twelve hundred metres.”

“It’s awful cold,” Bill said.

The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to
Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The
houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no
side-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus
stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the
rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps
came up.

“What’s in there?” he pointed to the rod-case.

I opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I
got them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on.

“Is that all right?” I asked.

“Yes. Of course.”

We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families
sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.

The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands
with us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again.
It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The
woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two
beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of
Nuestra Señora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the
shutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on
sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone
floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it
was so cold you could see your breath.

“My God!” said Bill. “It can’t be this cold to-morrow. I’m not going to
wade a stream in this weather.”

There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the
wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.

“I got to keep warm,” he said.

I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board
was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.

“Twelve pesetas.”

“Why, we only paid that in Pamplona.”

She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on
her apron.

“That’s too much,” I said. “We didn’t pay more than that at a big
hotel.”

“We’ve put in a bathroom.”

“Haven’t you got anything cheaper?”

“Not in the summer. Now is the big season.”

We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it’s only a few
days.

“Is the wine included?”

“Oh, yes.”

“Well,” I said. “It’s all right.”

I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was,
and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the
pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of
pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all
dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I
looked at them all. Bill was still playing. “How about a hot rum punch?”
he said. “This isn’t going to keep me warm permanently.”

I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it.
In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the
room. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and
listened to the wind.

“There isn’t too much rum in that.”

I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a
half-tumblerful into the pitcher.

“Direct action,” said Bill. “It beats legislation.”

The girl came in and laid the table for supper.

“It blows like hell up here,” Bill said.

The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We
had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of
wild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was
shy but nice about bringing it. The old woman looked in once and counted
the empty bottles.

After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm.
Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be
warm and in bed.




                                CHAPTER
                                   12


When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had
cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the
window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof
cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days
before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to
the roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below
and when I waved at him he bounded down.

Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the
hall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring down-stairs, so I
unbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning
and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died
down. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of
mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for
bait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On
the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and
loosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of
sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many.
Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins
with worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig.

When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I
asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was
awake and sitting on the edge of the bed.

“I saw you out of the window,” he said. “Didn’t want to interrupt you.
What were you doing? Burying your money?”

“You lazy bum!”

“Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every
morning.”

“Come on,” I said. “Get up.”

“What? Get up? I never get up.”

He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.

“Try and argue me into getting up.”

I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the
tackle-bag.

“Aren’t you interested?” Bill asked.

“I’m going down and eat.”

“Eat? Why didn’t you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for
fun. Eat? Fine. Now you’re reasonable. You go out and dig some more
worms and I’ll be right down.”

“Oh, go to hell!”

“Work for the good of all.” Bill stepped into his underclothes. “Show
irony and pity.”

I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the
rod-case.

“Hey! come back!”

I put my head in the door.

“Aren’t you going to show a little irony and pity?”

I thumbed my nose.

“That’s not irony.”

As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, “Irony and Pity. When you’re
feeling . . . Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them
Irony. When they’re feeling . . . Just a little irony. Just a little
pity . . .” He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was:
“The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal.” I was reading a week-old
Spanish paper.

“What’s all this irony and pity?”

“What? Don’t you know about Irony and Pity?”

“No. Who got it up?”

“Everybody. They’re mad about it in New York. It’s just like the
Fratellinis used to be.”

The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was
bread toasted and buttered.

“Ask her if she’s got any jam,” Bill said. “Be ironical with her.”

“Have you got any jam?”

“That’s not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish.”

The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought
in a glass dish of raspberry jam.

“Thank you.”

“Hey! that’s not the way,” Bill said. “Say something ironical. Make some
crack about Primo de Rivera.”

“I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they’ve gotten into in
the Riff.”

“Poor,” said Bill. “Very poor. You can’t do it. That’s all. You don’t
understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful.”

“Robert Cohn.”

“Not so bad. That’s better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic.”

He took a big gulp of coffee.

“Aw, hell!” I said. “It’s too early in the morning.”

“There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You’re only a
newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical
the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full
of pity.”

“Go on,” I said. “Who did you get this stuff from?”

“Everybody. Don’t you read? Don’t you ever see anybody? You know what
you are? You’re an expatriate. Why don’t you live in New York? Then
you’d know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and
tell you every year?”

“Take some more coffee,” I said.

“Good. Coffee is good for you. It’s the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are
here. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You
know what’s the trouble with you? You’re an expatriate. One of the worst
type. Haven’t you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country
ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers.”

He drank the coffee.

“You’re an expatriate. You’ve lost touch with the soil. You get
precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to
death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not
working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés.”

“It sounds like a swell life,” I said. “When do I work?”

“You don’t work. One group claims women support you. Another group
claims you’re impotent.”

“No,” I said. “I just had an accident.”

“Never mention that,” Bill said. “That’s the sort of thing that can’t be
spoken of. That’s what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry’s
bicycle.”

He had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he
had hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him
again.

“It wasn’t a bicycle,” I said. “He was riding horseback.”

“I heard it was a tricycle.”

“Well,” I said. “A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works
the same way.”

“But you don’t pedal it.”

“No,” I said, “I guess you don’t pedal it.”

“Let’s lay off that,” Bill said.

“All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle.”

“I think he’s a good writer, too,” Bill said. “And you’re a hell of a
good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?”

“I’m not a good guy.”

“Listen. You’re a hell of a good guy, and I’m fonder of you than anybody
on earth. I couldn’t tell you that in New York. It’d mean I was a
faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a
faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis.
Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed
by the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel’s Lady and
Judy O’Grady are Lesbians under their skin.”

He stopped.

“Want to hear some more?”

“Shoot,” I said.

“I don’t know any more. Tell you some more at lunch.”

“Old Bill,” I said.

“You bum!”

We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill
put it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my
back. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a
path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of
the first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The
fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep
grazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the
woods.

The path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and
there was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the
stream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the
rolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red
roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust
rising.

Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road
led down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the
stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we
went into the woods.

It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked
above the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road
between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came
through the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big,
and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no
undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big
gray trees well spaced as though it were a park.

“This is country,” Bill said.

The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept
on climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the
time we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the
top of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the
highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete.
There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a
little clearing in the trees.

Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the
ridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great
fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees
and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.

“We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go
through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,”
I pointed out to Bill.

“That’s a hell of a hike.”

“It’s too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.”

“Comfortably. That’s a nice word. We’ll have to go like hell to get
there and back and have any fishing at all.”

It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when
we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the
valley of the Rio de la Fabrica.

The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead
was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field
of buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the
hillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam
that crossed the river.

Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods,
put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.

“You’re sure this thing has trout in it?” Bill asked.

“It’s full of them.”

“I’m going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?”

“There’s some in there.”

“You going to fish bait?”

“Yeah. I’m going to fish the dam here.”

“Well, I’ll take the fly-book, then.” He tied on a fly. “Where’d I
better go? Up or down?”

“Down is the best. They’re plenty up above, too.”

Bill went down the bank.

“Take a worm can.”

“No, I don’t want one. If they won’t take a fly I’ll just flick it
around.”

Bill was down below watching the stream.

“Say,” he called up against the noise of the dam. “How about putting the
wine in that spring up the road?”

“All right,” I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream.
I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road
to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a
board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly
into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my
hand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped
nobody would find the wine.

I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and
landing-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head
of water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the
squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river
tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was
deep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the
falls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout
jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into
the water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and
dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the
dam.

I did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt
that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost
double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him
up and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against
the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into
my bag.

While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I
baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the
same way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same
size. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same
way, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard
from the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked
out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I
took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water
above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the
bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then
three more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in
the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the
tree.

It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the
bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to
read until Bill should come up for lunch.

It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat
against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The
book was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful
story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a
glacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four
years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true
love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.

“Get any?” he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one
hand, and he was sweating. I hadn’t heard him come up, because of the
noise from the dam.

“Six. What did you get?”

Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took
out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them
side by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy.

“How are yours?”

“Smaller.”

“Let’s see them.”

“They’re packed.”

“How big are they really?”

“They’re all about the size of your smallest.”

“You’re not holding out on me?”

“I wish I were.”

“Get them all on worms?”

“Yes.”

“You lazy bum!”

Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the
open bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been
wading the stream.

I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were
cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I
spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and
leaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag
plump with ferns.

“Let’s see that bottle,” he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the
bottle and drank. “Whew! That makes my eyes ache.”

“Let’s try it.”

The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.

“That’s not such filthy wine,” Bill said.

“The cold helps it,” I said.

We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch.

“Chicken.”

“There’s hard-boiled eggs.”

“Find any salt?”

“First the egg,” said Bill. “Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see
that.”

“He’s dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.”

“No. Not really?”

“Yes. Bryan’s dead.”

Bill laid down the egg he was peeling.

“Gentlemen,” he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of
newspaper. “I reverse the order. For Bryan’s sake. As a tribute to the
Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.”

“Wonder what day God created the chicken?”

“Oh,” said Bill, sucking the drumstick, “how should we know? We should
not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and
believe and give thanks.”

“Eat an egg.”

Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in
the other.

“Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air.
Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little,
brother?”

“After you, brother.”

Bill took a long drink.

“Utilize a little, brother,” he handed me the bottle. “Let us not doubt,
brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with
simian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say—I want you to
join with me in saying—What shall we say, brother?” He pointed the
drumstick at me and went on. “Let me tell you. We will say, and I for
one am proud to say—and I want you to say with me, on your knees,
brother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors.
Remember the woods were God’s first temples. Let us kneel and say:
‘Don’t eat that, Lady—that’s Mencken.’”

“Here,” I said. “Utilize a little of this.”

We uncorked the other bottle.

“What’s the matter?” I said. “Didn’t you like Bryan?”

“I loved Bryan,” said Bill. “We were like brothers.”

“Where did you know him?”

“He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together.”

“And Frankie Fritsch.”

“It’s a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham.”

“Well,” I said, “I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning.”

“It’s a lie,” Bill said. “I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself.”

“You’re cock-eyed,” I said.

“On wine?”

“Why not?”

“It’s the humidity,” Bill said. “They ought to take this damn humidity
away.”

“Have another shot.”

“Is this all we’ve got?”

“Only the two bottles.”

“Do you know what you are?” Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.

“No,” I said.

“You’re in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League.”

“I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler.”

“It’s a lie,” said Bill. “I went to Austin Business College with Wayne
B. Wheeler. He was class president.”

“Well,” I said, “the saloon must go.”

“You’re right there, old classmate,” Bill said. “The saloon must go, and
I will take it with me.”

“You’re cock-eyed.”

“On wine?”

“On wine.”

“Well, maybe I am.”

“Want to take a nap?”

“All right.”

We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees.

“You asleep?”

“No,” Bill said. “I was thinking.”

I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground.

“Say,” Bill said, “what about this Brett business?”

“What about it?”

“Were you ever in love with her?”

“Sure.”

“For how long?”

“Off and on for a hell of a long time.”

“Oh, hell!” Bill said. “I’m sorry, fella.”

“It’s all right,” I said. “I don’t give a damn any more.”

“Really?”

“Really. Only I’d a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.”

“You aren’t sore I asked you?”

“Why the hell should I be?”

“I’m going to sleep,” Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.

“Listen, Jake,” he said, “are you really a Catholic?”

“Technically.”

“What does that mean?”

“I don’t know.”

“All right, I’ll go to sleep now,” he said. “Don’t keep me awake by
talking so much.”

I went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It
was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and
went out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.

“What did you do? Wake up?” Bill asked. “Why didn’t you spend the
night?” I stretched and rubbed my eyes.

“I had a lovely dream,” Bill said. “I don’t remember what it was about,
but it was a lovely dream.”

“I don’t think I dreamt.”

“You ought to dream,” Bill said. “All our biggest business men have been
dreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller.
Look at Jo Davidson.”

I disjointed my rod and Bill’s and packed them in the rod-case. I put
the reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one
of the trout-bags in. I carried the other.

“Well,” said Bill, “have we got everything?”

“The worms.”

“Your worms. Put them in there.”

He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the
outside flap pockets.

“You got everything now?”

I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.

“Yes.”

We started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to
Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the
road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows
lighted, to the inn.

We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were
cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the
heat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a
cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the
bank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the
evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris,
who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the
inn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the
Irati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.




                                CHAPTER
                                   13


One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was
already at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He
looked up and smiled.

“Good morning,” he said. “Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they
gave it me with mine.”

The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup.
Harris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been
forwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:

    DEAR JAKE,

    We got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought
    her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours. We go to
    Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don’t know what
    hour. Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to
    rejoin you all on Wednesday. All our love and sorry to be late,
    but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by
    Tues. and is practically so now. I know her so well and try to
    look after her but it’s not so easy. Love to all the chaps,

                                                          MICHAEL.

“What day of the week is it?” I asked Harris.

“Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses
track of the days up here in the mountains.”

“Yes. We’ve been here nearly a week.”

“I hope you’re not thinking of leaving?”

“Yes. We’ll go in on the afternoon bus, I’m afraid.”

“What a rotten business. I had hoped we’d all have another go at the
Irati together.”

“We have to go _into_ Pamplona. We’re meeting people there.”

“What rotten luck for me. We’ve had a jolly time here at Burguete.”

“Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there’s
going to be a damned fine fiesta.”

“I’d like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I’d best stop on here,
though. I’ve not much more time to fish.”

“You want those big ones in the Irati.”

“I say, I do, you know. They’re enormous trout there.”

“I’d like to try them once more.”

“Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap.”

“We really have to get into town,” I said.

“What a pity.”

After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench
out in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the
road from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a
telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.

“Por ustedes?”

I looked at it. The address was: “Barnes, Burguete.”

“Yes. It’s for us.”

She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of
coppers. The telegram was in Spanish: “Vengo Jueves Cohn.”

I handed it to Bill.

“What does the word Cohn mean?” he asked.

“What a lousy telegram!” I said. “He could send ten words for the same
price. ‘I come Thursday.’ That gives you a lot of dope, doesn’t it?”

“It gives you all the dope that’s of interest to Cohn.”

“We’re going in, anyway,” I said. “There’s no use trying to move Brett
and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?”

“We might as well,” said Bill. “There’s no need for us to be snooty.”

We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank.

“What will we say?” Bill asked.

“‘Arriving to-night.’ That’s enough.”

We paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and
the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the
monastery.

“It’s a remarkable place,” Harris said, when we came out. “But you know
I’m not much on those sort of places.”

“Me either,” Bill said.

“It’s a remarkable place, though,” Harris said. “I wouldn’t not have
seen it. I’d been intending coming up each day.”

“It isn’t the same as fishing, though, is it?” Bill asked. He liked
Harris.

“I say not.”

We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery.

“Isn’t that a pub across the way?” Harris asked. “Or do my eyes deceive
me?”

“It has the look of a pub,” Bill said.

“It looks to me like a pub,” I said.

“I say,” said Harris, “let’s utilize it.” He had taken up utilizing from
Bill.

We had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay. He talked
Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.

“I say. You don’t know what it’s meant to me to have you chaps up here.”

“We’ve had a grand time, Harris.”

Harris was a little tight.

“I say. Really you don’t know how much it means. I’ve not had much fun
since the war.”

“We’ll fish together again, some time. Don’t you forget it, Harris.”

“We must. We _have_ had such a jolly good time.”

“How about another bottle around?”

“Jolly good idea,” said Harris.

“This is mine,” said Bill. “Or we don’t drink it.”

“I wish you’d let me pay for it. It _does_ give me pleasure, you know.”

“This is going to give me pleasure,” Bill said.

The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same
glasses. Harris lifted his glass.

“I say. You know this does utilize well.”

Bill slapped him on the back.

“Good old Harris.”

“I say. You know my name isn’t really Harris. It’s Wilson-Harris. All
one name. With a hyphen, you know.”

“Good old Wilson-Harris,” Bill said. “We call you Harris because we’re
so fond of you.”

“I say, Barnes. You don’t know what this all means to me.”

“Come on and utilize another glass,” I said.

“Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can’t know. That’s all.”

“Drink up, Harris.”

We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us.
We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us
his card, with his address in London and his club and his business
address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I
opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them
himself. He tied all his own flies.

“I say, Harris—” I began.

“No, no!” he said. He was climbing down from the bus. “They’re not
first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it
might remind you of what a good time we had.”

The bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As
we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.

“Say, wasn’t that Harris nice?” Bill said.

“I think he really did have a good time.”

“Harris? You bet he did.”

“I wish he’d come into Pamplona.”

“He wanted to fish.”

“Yes. You couldn’t tell how English would mix with each other, anyway.”

“I suppose not.”

We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front
of the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing
electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came
up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the
people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We
went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with
us, smiling in his embarrassed way.

“Your friends are here,” he said.

“Mr. Campbell?”

“Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.”

He smiled as though there were something I would hear about.

“When did they get in?”

“Yesterday. I’ve saved you the rooms you had.”

“That’s fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?”

“Yes. All the rooms we looked at.”

“Where are our friends now?”

“I think they went to the pelota.”

“And how about the bulls?”

Montoya smiled. “To-night,” he said. “To-night at seven o’clock they
bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go
down?”

“Oh, yes. They’ve never seen a desencajonada.”

Montoya put his hand on my shoulder.

“I’ll see you there.”

He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very
special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very
deep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were
something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something
that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not
understand.

“Your friend, is he aficionado, too?” Montoya smiled at Bill.

“Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.”

“Yes?” Montoya politely disbelieved. “But he’s not aficionado like you.”

He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.

“Yes,” I said. “He’s a real aficionado.”

“But he’s not aficionado like you are.”

Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the
bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya’s hotel; that
is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed
once, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year.
In Montoya’s room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated
to Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters
Montoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters
who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They
often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean
anything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the
waste-basket. He did not want them around.

We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the
Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It
was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come
in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a
few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those
who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was
full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very
polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an
American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not
have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he
could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there
was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was
a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little
on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed
putting the hand on the shoulder, or a “Buen hombre.” But nearly always
there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch
you to make it certain.

Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He
could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all
sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At
once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they
were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling
open of the horses in bull-fighting.

Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and
changing in his room.

“Well,” he said, “talk a lot of Spanish?”

“He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night.”

“Let’s find the gang and go down.”

“All right. They’ll probably be at the café.”

“Have you got tickets?”

“Yes. I got them for all the unloadings.”

“What’s it like?” He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to
see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.

“It’s pretty good,” I said. “They let the bulls out of the cages one at
a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them
from fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run
around like old maids trying to quiet them down.”

“Do they ever gore the steers?”

“Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them.”

“Can’t the steers do anything?”

“No. They’re trying to make friends.”

“What do they have them in for?”

“To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the
stone walls, or goring each other.”

“Must be swell being a steer.”

We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square
toward the Café Iruña. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses
standing in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and
SOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta.

Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña
extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for
Brett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert
Cohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was
bare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved.
Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.

“Hello, you chaps!” she called.

Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into
shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.

“Where the hell have you been?” I asked.

“I brought them up here,” Cohn said.

“What rot,” Brett said. “We’d have gotten here earlier if you hadn’t
come.”

“You’d never have gotten here.”

“What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill.”

“Did you get good fishing?” Mike asked. “We wanted to join you.”

“It wasn’t bad. We missed you.”

“I wanted to come,” Cohn said, “but I thought I ought to bring them.”

“You bring us. What rot.”

“Was it really good?” Mike asked. “Did you take many?”

“Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there.”

“Named Harris,” Bill said. “Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war,
too.”

“Fortunate fellow,” Mike said. “What times we had. How I wish those dear
days were back.”

“Don’t be an ass.”

“Were you in the war, Mike?” Cohn asked.

“Was I not.”

“He was a very distinguished soldier,” Brett said. “Tell them about the
time your horse bolted down Piccadilly.”

“I’ll not. I’ve told that four times.”

“You never told me,” Robert Cohn said.

“I’ll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.”

“Tell them about your medals.”

“I’ll not. That story reflects great discredit on me.”

“What story’s that?”

“Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit
on me.”

“Go on. Tell it, Brett.”

“Should I?”

“I’ll tell it myself.”

“What medals have you got, Mike?”

“I haven’t got any medals.”

“You must have some.”

“I suppose I’ve the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time
there was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be
there, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no
medals, and I stopped at my tailor’s and he was impressed by the
invitation, and I thought that’s a good piece of business, and I said to
him: ‘You’ve got to fix me up with some medals.’ He said: ‘What medals,
sir?’ And I said: ‘Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.’ So he
said: ‘What medals _have_ you, sir?’ And I said: ‘How should I know?’
Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? ‘Just give
me a good lot. Pick them out yourself.’ So he got me some medals, you
know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket
and forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they’d
shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn’t come and the King didn’t come,
and no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off
their medals, and I had mine in my pocket.”

He stopped for us to laugh.

“Is that all?”

“That’s all. Perhaps I didn’t tell it right.”

“You didn’t,” said Brett. “But no matter.”

We were all laughing.

“Ah, yes,” said Mike. “I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I
couldn’t stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in
my pocket. What’s this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut
them all off their backing—you know, they put them on a strip—and gave
them all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I
was hell’s own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club.
Dashing fellow.”

“Tell the rest,” Brett said.

“Don’t you think that was funny?” Mike asked. We were all laughing. “It
was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals
back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had
left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell’s own store
by them.” Mike paused. “Rotten luck for the tailor,” he said.

“You don’t mean it,” Bill said. “I should think it would have been grand
for the tailor.”

“Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now,” Mike said. “I
used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he
wouldn’t send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt.
It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.”

“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked.

“Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”

“What brought it on?”

“Friends,” said Mike. “I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had
creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.”

“Tell them about in the court,” Brett said.

“I don’t remember,” Mike said. “I was just a little tight.”

“Tight!” Brett exclaimed. “You were blind!”

“Extraordinary thing,” Mike said. “Met my former partner the other day.
Offered to buy me a drink.”

“Tell them about your learned counsel,” Brett said.

“I will not,” Mike said. “My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this
is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or
not?”

“Let’s go down.”

We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I
started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her
on the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento
with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down
past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were
many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down
the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips
rising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we
turned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in
the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.

“That’s where we’ll go when funds get low,” Brett said.

The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we
passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the
window and stared. They were staring at Brett.

At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that
went in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low,
stone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with
apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the
face of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people
were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls
that separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across
the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with
the bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had
come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been
unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out
of their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name
and the brand of the bull-breeder.

We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the
corral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the
ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.

“Look up there,” I said.

Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls
and ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications
made three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in
the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had
climbed into the trees.

“They must think something is going to happen,” Brett said.

“They want to see the bulls.”

Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They
waved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing
against us when other people crowded them.

“Why don’t they start?” Robert Cohn asked.

A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against
the gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars
into position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to
pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the
other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying
their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood
together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull
would enter.

“They don’t look happy,” Brett said.

The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the
corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.

I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark.
Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to
explode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his
horns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of
horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the
bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in
the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his
neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the
crowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall,
their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.

The bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the
boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he
reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man
had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick,
searching drives with the right horn.

“My God, isn’t he beautiful?” Brett said. We were looking right down on
him.

“Look how he knows how to use his horns,” I said. “He’s got a left and a
right just like a boxer.”

“Not really?”

“You watch.”

“It goes too fast.”

“Wait. There’ll be another one in a minute.”

They had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a
man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and
while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull
came out into the corral.

He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the
planks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the
men shouted: “Hah! Hah! Toro!” and waved their arms; the two steers
turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the
steers.

“Don’t look,” I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.

“Fine,” I said. “If it doesn’t buck you.”

“I saw it,” she said. “I saw him shift from his left to his right horn.”

“Damn good!”

The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay
the way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other
steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging,
watching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked
him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the
crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him
and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The
next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to
the other bull.

When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer,
stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the
newcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him
down, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been
unloaded the herd were all together.

The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against
the stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt
to join the herd.

We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the
bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all
quiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to
the café. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on
the way for several drinks.

We were sitting in the café.

“That’s an extraordinary business,” Brett said.

“Will those last ones fight as well as the first?” Robert Cohn asked.
“They seemed to quiet down awfully fast.”

“They all know each other,” I said. “They’re only dangerous when they’re
alone, or only two or three of them together.”

“What do you mean, dangerous?” Bill said. “They all looked dangerous to
me.”

“They only want to kill when they’re alone. Of course, if you went in
there you’d probably detach one of them from the herd, and he’d be
dangerous.”

“That’s too complicated,” Bill said. “Don’t you ever detach me from the
herd, Mike.”

“I say,” Mike said, “they _were_ fine bulls, weren’t they? Did you see
their horns?”

“Did I not,” said Brett. “I had no idea what they were like.”

“Did you see the one hit that steer?” Mike asked. “That was
extraordinary.”

“It’s no life being a steer,” Robert Cohn said.

“Don’t you think so?” Mike said. “I would have thought you’d loved being
a steer, Robert.”

“What do you mean, Mike?”

“They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they’re always
hanging about so.”

We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on
talking.

“I should think you’d love it. You’d never have to say a word. Come on,
Robert. Do say something. Don’t just sit there.”

“I said something, Mike. Don’t you remember? About the steers.”

“Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can’t you see we’re all
having a good time here?”

“Come off it, Michael. You’re drunk,” Brett said.

“I’m not drunk. I’m quite serious. _Is_ Robert Cohn going to follow
Brett around like a steer all the time?”

“Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.”

“Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls?
Aren’t the bulls lovely? Don’t you like them, Bill? Why don’t you say
something, Robert? Don’t sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What
if Brett did sleep with you? She’s slept with lots of better people than
you.”

“Shut up,” Cohn said. He stood up. “Shut up, Mike.”

“Oh, don’t stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That
won’t make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow
Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don’t you know you’re not wanted?
I know when I’m not wanted. Why don’t you know when you’re not wanted?
You came down to San Sebastian where you weren’t wanted, and followed
Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that’s right?”

“Shut up. You’re drunk.”

“Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren’t you drunk? Why don’t you ever get drunk,
Robert? You know you didn’t have a good time at San Sebastian because
none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can’t
blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn’t do it. You
can’t blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?”

“Go to hell, Mike.”

“I can’t blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around?
Haven’t you any manners? How do you think it makes _me_ feel?”

“You’re a splendid one to talk about manners,” Brett said. “You’ve such
lovely manners.”

“Come on, Robert,” Bill said.

“What do you follow her around for?”

Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn.

“Don’t go,” Mike said. “Robert Cohn’s going to buy a drink.”

Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn’s face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I
sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted.

“I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,” she interrupted.
“I’m not saying he’s not right, you know.” She turned to me.

The emotion left Mike’s voice. We were all friends together.

“I’m not so damn drunk as I sounded,” he said.

“I know you’re not,” Brett said.

“We’re none of us sober,” I said.

“I didn’t say anything I didn’t mean.”

“But you put it so badly,” Brett laughed.

“He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well
wasn’t wanted. He hung around Brett and just _looked_ at her. It made me
damned well sick.”

“He did behave very badly,” Brett said.

“Mark you. Brett’s had affairs with men before. She tells me all about
everything. She gave me this chap Cohn’s letters to read. I wouldn’t
read them.”

“Damned noble of you.”

“No, listen, Jake. Brett’s gone off with men. But they weren’t ever
Jews, and they didn’t come and hang about afterward.”

“Damned good chaps,” Brett said. “It’s all rot to talk about it. Michael
and I understand each other.”

“She gave me Robert Cohn’s letters. I wouldn’t read them.”

“You wouldn’t read any letters, darling. You wouldn’t read mine.”

“I can’t read letters,” Mike said. “Funny, isn’t it?”

“You can’t read anything.”

“No. You’re wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I’m at home.”

“You’ll be writing next,” Brett said. “Come on, Michael. Do buck up.
You’ve got to go through with this thing now. He’s here. Don’t spoil the
fiesta.”

“Well, let him behave, then.”

“He’ll behave. I’ll tell him.”

“You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.”

“Yes,” I said, “it would be nice for me to tell him.”

“Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you
know.”

“Oh, no. I can’t.”

“Go on. We’re all friends. Aren’t we all friends, Jake?”

“I can’t tell him. It’s too ridiculous.”

“I’ll tell him.”

“You won’t, Michael. Don’t be an ass.”

“He calls her Circe,” Mike said. “He claims she turns men into swine.
Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.”

“He’d be good, you know,” Brett said. “He writes a good letter.”

“I know,” I said. “He wrote me from San Sebastian.”

“That was nothing,” Brett said. “He can write a damned amusing letter.”

“She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.”

“I damned well was, too.”

“Come on,” I said, “we must go in and eat.”

“How should I meet Cohn?” Mike said.

“Just act as though nothing had happened.”

“It’s quite all right with me,” Mike said. “I’m not embarrassed.”

“If he says anything, just say you were tight.”

“Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight.”

“Come on,” Brett said. “Are these poisonous things paid for? I must
bathe before dinner.”

We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were
the lights from the cafés under the arcades. We walked across the gravel
under the trees to the hotel.

They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya.

“Well, how did you like the bulls?” he asked.

“Good. They were nice bulls.”

“They’re all right”—Montoya shook his head—“but they’re not too good.”

“What didn’t you like about them?”

“I don’t know. They just didn’t give me the feeling that they were so
good.”

“I know what you mean.”

“They’re all right.”

“Yes. They’re all right.”

“How did your friends like them?”

“Fine.”

“Good,” Montoya said.

I went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking
out at the square. I stood beside him.

“Where’s Cohn?”

“Up-stairs in his room.”

“How does he feel?”

“Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He’s terrible when he’s tight.”

“He wasn’t so tight.”

“The hell he wasn’t. I know what we had before we came to the café.”

“He sobered up afterward.”

“Good. He was terrible. I don’t like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was
a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any
business to talk like Mike.”

“How’d you like the bulls?”

“Grand. It’s grand the way they bring them out.”

“To-morrow come the Miuras.”

“When does the fiesta start?”

“Day after to-morrow.”

“We’ve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is
terrible.”

“We’d better get cleaned up for supper.”

“Yes. That will be a pleasant meal.”

“Won’t it?”

As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black,
sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as
though nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down.
He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but
he cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to
make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so
lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it.
They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was
Michael. They were good together.

It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much
wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could
not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and
was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.




                                CHAPTER
                                   14


I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on
a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk,
and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and
started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the
same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in “A
Sportsman’s Sketches.” I had read it before, but it seemed quite new.
The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head
seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes
because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that
feeling would pass.

I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night
outside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the
room next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour
before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them
laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not
necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the
wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why
because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is
light. The hell there isn’t!

I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the
electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women,
anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.

Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you
had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been
having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it.
I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the
presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the
swell things you could count on.

I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays
and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values.
You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for
something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my
way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either
you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances,
or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth and
knowing when you had it. You could get your money’s worth. The world was
a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years,
I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies
I’ve had.

Perhaps that wasn’t true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did
learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to
know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you
learned from that what it was all about.

I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a
bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never
drunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to
see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because
afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that
made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a
large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What
rot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you
got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The
English spoken language—the upper classes, anyway—must have fewer
words than the Eskimo. Of course I didn’t know anything about the
Eskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn’t
know anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with
inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though.
I liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper
classes.

I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that
now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too
much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem
as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was
another good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward
daylight I went to sleep.

The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows.
The town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts
that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from
the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their
way to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each
timber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the
town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them
stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big
gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being
swept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced
weakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the
smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old
women sweeping out the boxes.

Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the
entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the
crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning
of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the
horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees.
The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth
advertised =ANIS DEL TORO=. The cloth sign hung against the
planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town
there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the
terrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload
peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the
buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags
full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray
motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and
the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the
streets.

In the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all
the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the
fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the
square while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.

During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers
and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went
along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings
studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and
Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was
a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times,
once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I
told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting
as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know.
We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had
followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went
for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.

It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains.
It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the
plateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt
healthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about
anything on a day like that.

That was the last day before the fiesta.




                                CHAPTER
                                   15


At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no
other way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the
country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice
them. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The
peasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking,
getting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the
plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting
in values gradually. They could not start in paying café prices. They
got their money’s worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite
value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it
would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.

Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been
in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning.
Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the
cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.
They were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o’clock mass.
San Fermin is also a religious festival.

I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café
on the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were
sitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white
wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and
severe folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for
action. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read
without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as
soon as I sat down.

“What are you drinking?” I asked Bill and Robert.

“Sherry,” Cohn said.

“Jerez,” I said to the waiter.

Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the
fiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of
smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the
plaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I
watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright
sunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of
smoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so
many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the
waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get
through the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from
all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the
drums coming. They were playing the _riau-riau_ music, the pipes shrill
and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.
When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when
the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums
tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd
you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.

In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd
of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He
came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past
the café and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he
went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at
him.

“He must be the village idiot,” Bill said. “My God! look at that!”

Down the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all
men. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers.
They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen’s blue smocks, and
red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two
poles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down
surrounded by the crowd.

“Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!” was painted on the banner.

“Where are the foreigners?” Robert Cohn asked.

“We’re the foreigners,” Bill said.

All the time rockets were going up. The café tables were all full now.
The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés.

“Where’s Brett and Mike?” Bill asked.

“I’ll go and get them,” Cohn said.

“Bring them here.”

The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days.
The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things
that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything
became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have
any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during
the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was
quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the
same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven
days.

That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was
translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the
dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the
crowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced
the _riau-riau_ dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up
and down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the
closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were
the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King
and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the _riau-riau_.

They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the
dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with
the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the
dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started
inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the
church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no
hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the
chapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping
their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers
formed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths
of white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms
and put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all
chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They
wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the
sharp _riau-riau!_ they rushed us into a wine-shop.

We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was
dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back
of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the
wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.

“I want a leather wine-bottle,” Bill said.

“There’s a place down the street,” I said. “I’ll go get a couple.”

The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the
high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the
wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one
insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song.
Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill’s back.

I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went
down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The
crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered,
and I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both
sides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and
led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.

Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was
stencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He
took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on
it

“See! It doesn’t leak.”

“I want another one, too. A big one.”

He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof.
He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on
the bota holding on to a chair.

“What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?”

“No. Drink out of them.”

He slapped me on the back.

“Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price.”

The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile
stopped.

“It’s true,” he said. “Eight pesetas is cheap.”

I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop. It was
darker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill,
and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl
filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held
five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some
one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the
wine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay
then bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said
he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the
big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the
back of his throat.

“All right,” he said, and handed back the bag.

In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by
the dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else’s shoulders, and
they were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in
their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and
vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar
with pieces of bread.

“Hello, Jake. Hello!” Mike called. “Come here. I want you to meet my
friends. We’re all having an hors-d’œuvre.”

I was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names
to Mike and sent for a fork for me.

“Stop eating their dinner, Michael,” Brett shouted from the
wine-barrels.

“I don’t want to eat up your meal,” I said when some one handed me a
fork.

“Eat,” he said. “What do you think it’s here for?”

I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.
Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm’s length.

Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession
going by.

“Isn’t that the procession?” Mike asked.

“Nada,” some one said. “It’s nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle.”

“Where did they find you?” I asked Mike.

“Some one brought me here,” Mike said. “They said you were here.”

“Where’s Cohn?”

“He’s passed out,” Brett called. “They’ve put him away somewhere.”

“Where is he?”

“I don’t know.”

“How should we know,” Bill said. “I think he’s dead.”

“He’s not dead,” Mike said. “I know he’s not dead. He’s just passed out
on Anis del Mono.”

As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought
out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me.

“No,” I said. “No, thanks!”

“Yes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!”

I took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could
feel it warming in my stomach.

“Where the hell is Cohn?”

“I don’t know,” Mike said. “I’ll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?” he
asked in Spanish.

“You want to see him?”

“Yes,” I said.

“Not me,” said Mike. “This gent.”

The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.

“Come on.”

In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It
was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat
and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his
chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.

“Let him sleep,” the man whispered. “He’s all right.”

Two hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with
the wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he
came in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.

“I must have been sleeping,” he said.

“Oh, not at all,” Brett said.

“You were only dead,” Bill said.

“Aren’t we going to go and have some supper?” Cohn asked.

“Do you want to eat?”

“Yes. Why not? I’m hungry.”

“Eat those garlics, Robert,” Mike said. “I say. Do eat those garlics.”

Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right.

“Do let’s go and eat,” Brett said. “I must get a bath.”

“Come on,” Bill said. “Let’s translate Brett to the hotel.”

We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and
went out. Outside it was dark.

“What time is it do you suppose?” Cohn asked.

“It’s to-morrow,” Mike said. “You’ve been asleep two days.”

“No,” said Cohn, “what time is it?”

“It’s ten o’clock.”

“What a lot we’ve drunk.”

“You mean what a lot _we’ve_ drunk. You went to sleep.”

Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up
in the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the
square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.

It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices
being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After
the dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would
stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six
o’clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around
four o’clock. The others stayed up.

My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs
and slept on one of the beds in Cohn’s room. The fiesta was going on
outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When
I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the
release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would
race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping
heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn’s and
went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the
balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the
street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along
and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men
running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind
them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing
their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One
man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right
on and did not notice him. They were all running together.

After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It
kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had
gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back
in the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony
in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring.
Back in bed, I went to sleep.

Cohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and
closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just
across the street were looking in.

“Did you see the show?” I asked.

“Yes. We were all there.”

“Anybody get hurt?”

“One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight
people.”

“How did Brett like it?”

“It was all so sudden there wasn’t any time for it to bother anybody.”

“I wish I’d been up.”

“We didn’t know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.”

“Where did you stay up?”

“We danced at some club.”

“I got sleepy,” I said.

“My gosh! I’m sleepy now,” Cohn said. “Doesn’t this thing ever stop?”

“Not for a week.”

Bill opened the door and put his head in.

“Where were you, Jake?”

“I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?”

“Grand.”

“Where you going?”

“To sleep.”

No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade.
The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we
went over to the Iruña. It had filled up, and as the time for the
bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There
was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The
café did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how
crowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.

I had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras,
the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with
wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best
sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill
and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to
a waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how
to look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of
bull-fights.

“I’m not worried about how I’ll stand it. I’m only afraid I may be
bored,” Cohn said.

“You think so?”

“Don’t look at the horses, after the bull hits them,” I said to Brett.
“Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but
then don’t look again until the horse is dead if it’s been hit.”

“I’m a little nervy about it,” Brett said. “I’m worried whether I’ll be
able to go through with it all right.”

“You’ll be all right. There’s nothing but that horse part that will
bother you, and they’re only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just
don’t watch when it’s bad.”

“She’ll be all right,” Mike said. “I’ll look after her.”

“I don’t think you’ll be bored,” Bill said.

“I’m going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin,” I
said. “See you back here. Don’t get cock-eyed.”

“I’ll come along,” Bill said. Brett smiled at us.

We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.

“That Cohn gets me,” Bill said. “He’s got this Jewish superiority so
strong that he thinks the only emotion he’ll get out of the fight will
be being bored.”

“We’ll watch him with the glasses,” I said.

“Oh, to hell with him!”

“He spends a lot of time there.”

“I want him to stay there.”

In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.

“Come on,” said Montoya. “Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?”

“Fine,” said Bill. “Let’s go see him.”

We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.

“He’s in room number eight,” Montoya explained. “He’s getting dressed
for the bull-fight.”

Montoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a
little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were
two beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on.
The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes.
His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing
winding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore
a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up
and stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and
dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great
aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero
listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking
boy I have ever seen.

“You go to the bull-fight,” he said in English.

“You know English,” I said, feeling like an idiot.

“No,” he answered, and smiled.

One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us
if we spoke French. “Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there
anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?”

We thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was
nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three
hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We
wished him “Mucha suerte,” shook hands, and went out. He was standing,
straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with
the hangers-on as we shut the door.

“He’s a fine boy, don’t you think so?” Montoya asked.

“He’s a good-looking kid,” I said.

“He looks like a torero,” Montoya said. “He has the type.”

“He’s a fine boy.”

“We’ll see how he is in the ring,” Montoya said.

We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my
room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went
down-stairs.

It was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro
Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had
killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This
was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the
other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But
there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was
much.

Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and
Cohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look
upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front
of them.

“Let me take the glasses,” Bill said.

“Does Cohn look bored?” I asked.

“That kike!”

Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in
the crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with
the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that
disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and
the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta
was going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and
everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The
dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the
feet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and
down. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café. The waiter
saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched
the crowd in the square and the dancers.

“What do you suppose that dance is?” Bill asked.

“It’s a sort of jota.”

“They’re not all the same,” Bill said. “They dance differently to all
the different tunes.”

“It’s swell dancing.”

In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were
dancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and
concentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled
shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels
touched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and
the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.

“Here come the gentry,” Bill said.

They were crossing the street

“Hello, men,” I said.

“Hello, gents!” said Brett. “You saved us seats? How nice.”

“I say,” Mike said, “that Romero what’shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?”

“Oh, isn’t he lovely,” Brett said. “And those green trousers.”

“Brett never took her eyes off them.”

“I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow.”

“How did it go?”

“Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!”

“How about the horses?”

“I couldn’t help looking at them.”

“She couldn’t take her eyes off them,” Mike said. “She’s an
extraordinary wench.”

“They do have some rather awful things happen to them,” Brett said. “I
couldn’t look away, though.”

“Did you feel all right?”

“I didn’t feel badly at all.”

“Robert Cohn did,” Mike put in. “You were quite green, Robert.”

“The first horse did bother me,” Cohn said.

“You weren’t bored, were you?” asked Bill.

Cohn laughed.

“No. I wasn’t bored. I wish you’d forgive me that.”

“It’s all right,” Bill said, “so long as you weren’t bored.”

“He didn’t look bored,” Mike said. “I thought he was going to be sick.”

“I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.”

“I thought he was going to be sick. You weren’t bored, were you,
Robert?”

“Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.”

“He was, you know. He was positively green.”

“Oh, shove it along, Michael.”

“You mustn’t ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert,” Mike
said. “It might make such a mess.”

“Oh, shove it along, Michael,” Brett said.

“He said Brett was a sadist,” Mike said. “Brett’s not a sadist. She’s
just a lovely, healthy wench.”

“Are you a sadist, Brett?” I asked.

“Hope not.”

“He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy
stomach.”

“Won’t be healthy long.”

Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought
the absinthe glasses.

“Did you really like it?” Bill asked Cohn.

“No, I can’t say I liked it. I think it’s a wonderful show.”

“Gad, yes! What a spectacle!” Brett said.

“I wish they didn’t have the horse part,” Cohn said.

“They’re not important,” Bill said. “After a while you never notice
anything disgusting.”

“It is a bit strong just at the start,” Brett said. “There’s a dreadful
moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.”

“The bulls were fine,” Cohn said.

“They were very good,” Mike said.

“I want to sit down below, next time.” Brett drank from her glass of
absinthe.

“She wants to see the bull-fighters close by,” Mike said.

“They are something,” Brett said. “That Romero lad is just a child.”

“He’s a damned good-looking boy,” I said. “When we were up in his room I
never saw a better-looking kid.”

“How old do you suppose he is?”

“Nineteen or twenty.”

“Just imagine it.”

The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first.
Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up
above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other
bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled
technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they
did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all
about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls
charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the
point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it
became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of
a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took
the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him
with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the
bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his
bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but
smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull,
and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make
it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked
Romero’s cape-work and why she did not like the others.

Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and
natural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their
elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns
had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was
faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero’s bull-fighting
gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his
movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close
each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how
something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it
were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito
all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this
appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while
the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding
of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he
dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he
prepared him for the killing.

“I’ve never seen him do an awkward thing,” Brett said.

“You won’t until he gets frightened,” I said.

“He’ll never be frightened,” Mike said. “He knows too damned much.”

“He knew everything when he started. The others can’t ever learn what he
was born with.”

“And God, what looks,” Brett said.

“I believe, you know, that she’s falling in love with this bull-fighter
chap,” Mike said.

“I wouldn’t be surprised.”

“Be a good chap, Jake. Don’t tell her anything more about him. Tell her
how they beat their old mothers.”

“Tell me what drunks they are.”

“Oh, frightful,” Mike said. “Drunk all day and spend all their time
beating their poor old mothers.”

“He looks that way,” Brett said.

“Doesn’t he?” I said.

They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked,
the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke
into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a
swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.

“This next is the last one.”

“Not really,” Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero
waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his
chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.

After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.

“These bull-fights are hell on one,” Brett said. “I’m limp as a rag.”

“Oh, you’ll get a drink,” Mike said.

The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very
bad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all
day and all night the fiesta kept on.




                                CHAPTER
                                   16


In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from
the sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was
dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were
changed. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad
weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.

The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners
were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between
the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the
arcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and
dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only
driven under cover.

The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting
out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers
and singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes
danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp,
and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed
horses, their costumes wet, the horses’ coats wet in the rain. The crowd
was in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their
tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their
belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs
to dry. It was raining hard outside.

I left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved
for dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.

“Come in,” I called.

Montoya walked in.

“How are you?” he said.

“Fine,” I said.

“No bulls to-day.”

“No,” I said, “nothing but rain.”

“Where are your friends?”

“Over at the Iruña.”

Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile.

“Look,” he said. “Do you know the American ambassador?”

“Yes,” I said. “Everybody knows the American ambassador.”

“He’s here in town, now.”

“Yes,” I said. “Everybody’s seen them.”

“I’ve seen them, too,” Montoya said. He didn’t say anything. I went on
shaving.

“Sit down,” I said. “Let me send for a drink.”

“No, I have to go.”

I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with
cold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.

“Look,” he said. “I’ve just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel
that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee
to-night after dinner.”

“Well,” I said, “it can’t hurt Marcial any.”

“Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this
morning with Marquez. I don’t think they’ll be back to-night.”

Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something.

“Don’t give Romero the message,” I said.

“You think so?”

“Absolutely.”

Montoya was very pleased.

“I wanted to ask you because you were an American,” he said.

“That’s what I’d do.”

“Look,” said Montoya. “People take a boy like that. They don’t know what
he’s worth. They don’t know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter
him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they’re
through.”

“Like Algabeno,” I said.

“Yes, like Algabeno.”

“They’re a fine lot,” I said. “There’s one American woman down here now
that collects bull-fighters.”

“I know. They only want the young ones.”

“Yes,” I said. “The old ones get fat.”

“Or crazy like Gallo.”

“Well,” I said, “it’s easy. All you have to do is not give him the
message.”

“He’s such a fine boy,” said Montoya. “He ought to stay with his own
people. He shouldn’t mix in that stuff.”

“Won’t you have a drink?” I asked.

“No,” said Montoya, “I have to go.” He went out.

I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the
arcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the
Iruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the
square and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs
dining-room.

They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill
was buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and
each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.

“This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished,” Mike said. “I
say, Bill is an ass.”

The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.

“Limpia botas?” he said to Bill.

“No,” said Bill. “For this Señor.”

The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike’s
free shoe that shone already in the electric light.

“Bill’s a yell of laughter,” Mike said.

I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little
uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At
the next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me
to come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost
touching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man
with a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was
very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I
reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm.
Romero laughed.

“Drink here,” he said in English.

He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased
with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure
of, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for
_Corrida de toros_, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious
of. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the _lidia_ of a _toro_.
The Spanish word _corrida_ means in English the running of bulls—the
French translation is _Course de taureaux_. The critic put that in.
There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.

Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was
born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting
in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it
three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of
_Malagueño_ expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His
older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in
this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked
for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I
told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to
explain after I had made the mistake.

“Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?”

“Yes,” I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid
in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.

“The first or the second time?”

“The first.”

“I was very bad,” he said. “The second time I was better. You remember?”
He turned to the critic.

He was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something
altogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly
about him.

“I like it very much that you like my work,” he said. “But you haven’t
seen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to
you.”

When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic
nor I would think he was boasting.

“I am anxious to see it,” the critic said. “I would like to be
convinced.”

“He doesn’t like my work much.” Romero turned to me. He was serious.

The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had
been incomplete.

“Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.”

“Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?” the critic asked me.

“Yes. I saw them unloaded.”

Pedro Romero leaned forward.

“What did you think of them?”

“Very nice,” I said. “About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns.
Haven’t you seen them?”

“Oh, yes,” said Romero.

“They won’t weigh twenty-six arrobas,” said the critic.

“No,” said Romero.

“They’ve got bananas for horns,” the critic said.

“You call them bananas?” asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled.
“_You_ wouldn’t call them bananas?”

“No,” I said. “They’re horns all right.”

“They’re very short,” said Pedro Romero. “Very, very short. Still, they
aren’t bananas.”

“I say, Jake,” Brett called from the next table, “you _have_ deserted
us.”

“Just temporarily,” I said. “We’re talking bulls.”

“You _are_ superior.”

“Tell him that bulls have no balls,” Mike shouted. He was drunk.

Romero looked at me inquiringly.

“Drunk,” I said. “Borracho! Muy borracho!”

“You might introduce your friends,” Brett said. She had not stopped
looking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee
with us. They both stood up. Romero’s face was very brown. He had very
nice manners.

I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was
not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to
have coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for
everybody. There was a lot of drunken talking.

“Tell him I think writing is lousy,” Bill said. “Go on, tell him. Tell
him I’m ashamed of being a writer.”

Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.

“Go on. Tell him!” Bill said.

Romero looked up smiling.

“This gentleman,” I said, “is a writer.”

Romero was impressed. “This other one, too,” I said, pointing at Cohn.

“He looks like Villalta,” Romero said, looking at Bill. “Rafael, doesn’t
he look like Villalta?”

“I can’t see it,” the critic said.

“Really,” Romero said in Spanish. “He looks a lot like Villalta. What
does the drunken one do?”

“Nothing.”

“Is that why he drinks?”

“No. He’s waiting to marry this lady.”

“Tell him bulls have no balls!” Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other
end of the table.

“What does he say?”

“He’s drunk.”

“Jake,” Mike called. “Tell him bulls have no balls!”

“You understand?” I said.

“Yes.”

I was sure he didn’t, so it was all right.

“Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants.”

“Pipe down, Mike.”

“Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants.”

“Pipe down.”

During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett
was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and
laughing.

Bill was filling the glasses.

“Tell him Brett wants to come into——”

“Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ’s sake!”

Romero looked up smiling. “Pipe down! I know that,” he said.

Just then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he
saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting
laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of
drunks. He did not even nod.

Montoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast.
“Let’s all drink to—” he began. “Pedro Romero,” I said. Everybody stood
up. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it
down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear
that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off
all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the
critic went out together.

“My God! he’s a lovely boy,” Brett said. “And how I would love to see
him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.”

“I started to tell him,” Mike began. “And Jake kept interrupting me. Why
do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?”

“Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you.”

“No, I’d like to get this settled.” He turned away from me. “Do you
think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among
us? People who are out to have a good time? For God’s sake don’t be so
noisy, Cohn!”

“Oh, cut it out, Mike,” Cohn said.

“Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party?
Why don’t you say something?”

“I said all I had to say the other night, Mike.”

“I’m not one of you literary chaps.” Mike stood shakily and leaned
against the table. “I’m not clever. But I do know when I’m not wanted.
Why don’t you see when you’re not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for
God’s sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don’t you think I’m right?”

He looked at us.

“Sure,” I said. “Let’s all go over to the Iruña.”

“No. Don’t you think I’m right? I love that woman.”

“Oh, don’t start that again. Do shove it along, Michael,” Brett said.

“Don’t you think I’m right, Jake?”

Cohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got
when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The
childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.

“Jake,” Mike said. He was almost crying. “You know I’m right. Listen,
you!” He turned to Cohn: “Go away! Go away now!”

“But I won’t go, Mike,” said Cohn.

“Then I’ll make you!” Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn
stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow,
his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready
to do battle for his lady love.

I grabbed Mike. “Come on to the café,” I said. “You can’t hit him here
in the hotel.”

“Good!” said Mike. “Good idea!”

We started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw
Cohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring
another glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at
nothing.

Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to
get through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was
playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the
fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A
balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind
or blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The
magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the
crowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.

Brett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and
watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little
platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above
the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The
wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito’s face was sweaty in
the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and
charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the
people. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened,
caught fire, and fell.

“They’re razzing Don Manuel,” Bill said.

“How do you know he’s Don Manuel?” Brett said.

“His name’s on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of
esta ciudad.”

“Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A collection of globos illuminados.
That’s what the paper said.”

The wind blew the band music away.

“I say, I wish one would go up,” Brett said. “That Don Manuel chap is
furious.”

“He’s probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out
‘Hail to San Fermin,’” Bill said.

“Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A bunch of bloody globos illuminados.”

“Come on,” said Brett. “We can’t stand here.”

“Her ladyship wants a drink,” Mike said.

“How you know things,” Brett said.

Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in.
We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on.

“Come on, let’s get out of here,” Bill said.

Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English
and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables.
Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had
acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill’s from Biarritz. She was
staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a
headache and had gone to bed.

“Here’s the pub,” Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar
where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all
sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not
full. There was nothing going on.

“This is a hell of a place,” Bill said.

“It’s too early.”

“Let’s take the bottle and come back later,” Bill said. “I don’t want to
sit here on a night like this.”

“Let’s go and look at the English,” Mike said. “I love to look at the
English.”

“They’re awful,” Bill said. “Where did they all come from?”

“They come from Biarritz,” Mike said, “They come to see the last day of
the quaint little Spanish fiesta.”

“I’ll festa them,” Bill said.

“You’re an extraordinarily beautiful girl.” Mike turned to Bill’s
friend. “When did you come here?”

“Come off it, Michael.”

“I say, she _is_ a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been
looking all this while? You’re a lovely thing. _Have_ we met? Come along
with me and Bill. We’re going to festa the English.”

“I’ll festa them,” Bill said, “What the hell are they doing at this
fiesta?”

“Come on,” Mike said. “Just us three. We’re going to festa the bloody
English. I hope you’re not English? I’m Scotch. I hate the English. I’m
going to festa them. Come on, Bill.”

Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the
café. Rockets were going up in the square.

“I’m going to sit here,” Brett said.

“I’ll stay with you,” Cohn said.

“Oh, don’t!” Brett said. “For God’s sake, go off somewhere. Can’t you
see Jake and I want to talk?”

“I didn’t,” Cohn said. “I thought I’d sit here because I felt a little
tight.”

“What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you’re tight, go
to bed. Go on to bed.”

“Was I rude enough to him?” Brett asked. Cohn was gone. “My God! I’m so
sick of him!”

“He doesn’t add much to the gayety.”

“He depresses me so.”

“He’s behaved very badly.”

“Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well.”

“He’s probably waiting just outside the door now.”

“Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can’t believe it
didn’t mean anything.”

“I know.”

“Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I’m so sick of the whole thing.
And Michael. Michael’s been lovely, too.”

“It’s been damned hard on Mike.”

“Yes. But he didn’t need to be a swine.”

“Everybody behaves badly,” I said. “Give them the proper chance.”

“You wouldn’t behave badly.” Brett looked at me.

“I’d be as big an ass as Cohn,” I said.

“Darling, don’t let’s talk a lot of rot.”

“All right. Talk about anything you like.”

“Don’t be difficult. You’re the only person I’ve got, and I feel rather
awful to-night.”

“You’ve got Mike.”

“Yes, Mike. Hasn’t he been pretty?”

“Well,” I said, “it’s been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and
seeing him with you.”

“Don’t I know it, darling? Please don’t make me feel any worse than I
do.”

Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away
from me and looking ahead at the wall.

“Want to go for a walk?”

“Yes. Come on.”

I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender.

“Let’s have one more drink of that,” Brett said. “My nerves are rotten.”

We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy.

“Come on,” said Brett.

As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.

“He _was_ there,” Brett said.

“He can’t be away from you.”

“Poor devil!”

“I’m not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.”

“I hate him, too,” she shivered. “I hate his damned suffering.”

We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the
lights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along
it to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with
light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden
bursts of music.

“Want to go in?”

“No.”

We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the
fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down.
Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind
was high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark
pits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the
cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.

“Don’t feel bad,” I said.

“I feel like hell,” Brett said. “Don’t let’s talk.”

We looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the
moonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the
mountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort.
Below to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black
and smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out.
Brett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered.

“It’s cold.”

“Want to walk back?”

“Through the park.”

We climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark
under the trees.

“Do you still love me, Jake?”

“Yes,” I said.

“Because I’m a goner,” Brett said.

“How?”

“I’m a goner. I’m mad about the Romero boy. I’m in love with him, I
think.”

“I wouldn’t be if I were you.”

“I can’t help it. I’m a goner. It’s tearing me all up inside.”

“Don’t do it.”

“I can’t help it. I’ve never been able to help anything.”

“You ought to stop it.”

“How can I stop it? I can’t stop things. Feel that?”

Her hand was trembling.

“I’m like that all through.”

“You oughtn’t to do it.”

“I can’t help it. I’m a goner now, anyway. Don’t you see the
difference?”

“No.”

“I’ve got to do something. I’ve got to do something I really want to do.
I’ve lost my self-respect.”

“You don’t have to do that.”

“Oh, darling, don’t be difficult. What do you think it’s meant to have
that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he’s acted?”

“Sure.”

“I can’t just stay tight all the time.”

“No.”

“Oh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through
this.”

“Sure.”

“I don’t say it’s right. It is right though for me. God knows, I’ve
never felt such a bitch.”

“What do you want me to do?”

“Come on,” Brett said. “Let’s go and find him.”

Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under
the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the
street that led into town.

Pedro Romero was in the café. He was at a table with other bull-fighters
and bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they
looked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down
the room.

“Ask him to come over and have a drink.”

“Not yet. He’ll come over.”

“I can’t look at him.”

“He’s nice to look at,” I said.

“I’ve always done just what I wanted.”

“I know.”

“I do feel such a bitch.”

“Well,” I said.

“My God!” said Brett, “the things a woman goes through.”

“Yes?”

“Oh, I do feel such a bitch.”

I looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to
the other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table.
I stood up and we shook hands.

“Won’t you have a drink?”

“You must have a drink with me,” he said. He seated himself, asking
Brett’s permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners.
But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face.

“You like cigars?” I asked.

“Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars.”

It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I
noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a
triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt
there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave
him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did
not want to make any mistake.

“You fight to-morrow?” I said.

“Yes,” he said. “Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?”

“No,” I said. “Badly?”

He shook his head.

“Nothing. Here,” he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the
fingers apart.

“Oh!” he said in English, “you tell fortunes?”

“Sometimes. Do you mind?”

“No. I like it.” He spread his hand flat on the table. “Tell me I live
for always, and be a millionaire.”

He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. “Look,” he said,
“do you see any bulls in my hand?”

He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.

“There are thousands of bulls,” Brett said. She was not at all nervous
now. She looked lovely.

“Good,” Romero laughed. “At a thousand duros apiece,” he said to me in
Spanish. “Tell me some more.”

“It’s a good hand,” Brett said. “I think he’ll live a long time.”

“Say it to me. Not to your friend.”

“I said you’d live a long time.”

“I know it,” Romero said. “I’m never going to die.”

I tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his
head.

“No. Don’t do that. The bulls are my best friends.”

I translated to Brett.

“You kill your friends?” she asked.

“Always,” he said in English, and laughed. “So they don’t kill me.” He
looked at her across the table.

“You know English well.”

“Yes,” he said. “Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody
know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English.”

“Why?” asked Brett.

“It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.”

“Why not?”

“They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that.”

“What are bull-fighters like?”

He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle
of his cigar and the expression of his face.

“Like at the table,” he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly
the expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. “No. I
must forget English.”

“Don’t forget it, yet,” Brett said.

“No?”

“No.”

“All right.”

He laughed again.

“I would like a hat like that,” Brett said.

“Good. I’ll get you one.”

“Right. See that you do.”

“I will. I’ll get you one to-night.”

I stood up. Romero rose, too.

“Sit down,” I said. “I must go and find our friends and bring them
here.”

He looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It
was understood all right.

“Sit down,” Brett said to him. “You must teach me Spanish.”

He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The
hard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not
pleasant. When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later,
Brett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty
cognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked
up the glasses and mopped off the table.




                                CHAPTER
                                   17


Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the
girl’s name.

“We’ve been thrown out,” Edna said.

“By the police,” said Mike. “There’s some people in there that don’t
like me.”

“I’ve kept them out of four fights,” Edna said. “You’ve got to help me.”

Bill’s face was red.

“Come back in, Edna,” he said. “Go on in there and dance with Mike.”

“It’s silly,” Edna said. “There’ll just be another row.”

“Damned Biarritz swine,” Bill said.

“Come on,” Mike said. “After all, it’s a pub. They can’t occupy a whole
pub.”

“Good old Mike,” Bill said. “Damned English swine come here and insult
Mike and try and spoil the fiesta.”

“They’re so bloody,” Mike said. “I hate the English.”

“They can’t insult Mike,” Bill said. “Mike is a swell fellow. They can’t
insult Mike. I won’t stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?” His
voice broke.

“Who cares?” Mike said. “I don’t care. Jake doesn’t care. Do _you_
care?”

“No,” Edna said. “Are you a bankrupt?”

“Of course I am. You don’t care, do you, Bill?”

Bill put his arm around Mike’s shoulder.

“I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I’d show those bastards.”

“They’re just English,” Mike said. “It never makes any difference what
the English say.”

“The dirty swine,” Bill said. “I’m going to clean them out.”

“Bill,” Edna looked at me. “Please don’t go in again, Bill. They’re so
stupid.”

“That’s it,” said Mike. “They’re stupid. I knew that was what it was.”

“They can’t say things like that about Mike,” Bill said.

“Do you know them?” I asked Mike.

“No. I never saw them. They say they know me.”

“I won’t stand it,” Bill said.

“Come on. Let’s go over to the Suizo,” I said.

“They’re a bunch of Edna’s friends from Biarritz,” Bill said.

“They’re simply stupid,” Edna said.

“One of them’s Charley Blackman, from Chicago,” Bill said.

“I was never in Chicago,” Mike said.

Edna started to laugh and could not stop.

“Take me away from here,” she said, “you bankrupts.”

“What kind of a row was it?” I asked Edna. We were walking across the
square to the Suizo. Bill was gone.

“I don’t know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep
Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at
Cannes. What’s the matter with Mike?”

“Probably he owes them money” I said. “That’s what people usually get
bitter about.”

In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of
people waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground
with blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the
wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The
night was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line
were sleeping.

At the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert
Cohn came up.

“Where’s Brett?” he asked.

“I don’t know.”

“She was with you.”

“She must have gone to bed.”

“She’s not.”

“I don’t know where she is.”

His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up.

“Tell me where she is.”

“Sit down,” I said. “I don’t know where she is.”

“The hell you don’t!”

“You can shut your face.”

“Tell me where Brett is.”

“I’ll not tell you a damn thing.”

“You know where she is.”

“If I did I wouldn’t tell you.”

“Oh, go to hell, Cohn,” Mike called from the table. “Brett’s gone off
with the bull-fighter chap. They’re on their honeymoon.”

“You shut up.”

“Oh, go to hell!” Mike said languidly.

“Is that where she is?” Cohn turned to me.

“Go to hell!”

“She was with you. Is that where she is?”

“Go to hell!”

“I’ll make you tell me”—he stepped forward—“you damned pimp.”

I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light.
He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet
he hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up
and felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try
and hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my
head. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair.
Mike was pulling at my ears.

“I say, you were cold,” Mike said.

“Where the hell were you?”

“Oh, I was around.”

“You didn’t want to mix in it?”

“He knocked Mike down, too,” Edna said.

“He didn’t knock me out,” Mike said. “I just lay there.”

“Does this happen every night at your fiestas?” Edna asked. “Wasn’t that
Mr. Cohn?”

“I’m all right,” I said. “My head’s a little wobbly.”

There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around.

“Vaya!” said Mike. “Get away. Go on.”

The waiters moved the people away.

“It was quite a thing to watch,” Edna said. “He must be a boxer.”

“He is.”

“I wish Bill had been here,” Edna said. “I’d like to have seen Bill
knocked down, too. I’ve always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He’s so
big.”

“I was hoping he would knock down a waiter,” Mike said, “and get
arrested. I’d like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail.”

“No,” I said.

“Oh, no,” said Edna. “You don’t mean that.”

“I do, though,” Mike said. “I’m not one of these chaps likes being
knocked about. I never play games, even.”

Mike took a drink.

“I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having
a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?”

“All right.”

“You’re nice,” Edna said to Mike. “Are you really a bankrupt?”

“I’m a tremendous bankrupt,” Mike said. “I owe money to everybody. Don’t
you owe any money?”

“Tons.”

“I owe everybody money,” Mike said. “I borrowed a hundred pesetas from
Montoya to-night.”

“The hell you did,” I said.

“I’ll pay it back,” Mike said. “I always pay everything back.”

“That’s why you’re a bankrupt, isn’t it?” Edna said.

I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed
like some bad play.

“I’m going over to the hotel,” I said. Then I heard them talking about
me.

“Is he all right?” Edna asked.

“We’d better walk with him.”

“I’m all right,” I said. “Don’t come. I’ll see you all later.”

I walked away from the café. They were sitting at the table. I looked
back at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one
of the tables with his head in his hands.

Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and
changed. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the
flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I
felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was
carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the
street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it
was all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road,
and I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I
went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed
to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great
distance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was
like that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in
the hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling
that I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill
came out and met me in the hall.

“Say,” he said, “go up and see Cohn. He’s been in a jam, and he’s asking
for you.”

“The hell with him.”

“Go on. Go on up and see him.”

I did not want to climb another flight of stairs.

“What are you looking at me that way for?”

“I’m not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He’s in bad shape.”

“You were drunk a little while ago,” I said.

“I’m drunk now,” Bill said. “But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see
you.”

“All right,” I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I
went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the
hall to Cohn’s room. The door was shut and I knocked.

“Who is it?”

“Barnes.”

“Come in, Jake.”

I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no
light in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.

“Hello, Jake.”

“Don’t call me Jake.”

I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it
was a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.

“Where’s the bathroom?” I asked.

Cohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying. He had on a
white polo shirt, the kind he’d worn at Princeton.

“I’m sorry, Jake. Please forgive me.”

“Forgive you, hell.”

“Please forgive me, Jake.”

I did not say anything. I stood there by the door.

“I was crazy. You must see how it was.”

“Oh, that’s all right.”

“I couldn’t stand it about Brett.”

“You called me a pimp.”

I did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water.

“I know. Please don’t remember it. I was crazy.”

“That’s all right.”

He was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on
the bed in the dark. His polo shirt.

“I’m going away in the morning.”

He was crying without making any noise.

“I just couldn’t stand it about Brett. I’ve been through hell, Jake.
It’s been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as
though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn’t stand it. We lived
together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can’t stand it any
more.”

He lay there on the bed.

“Well,” I said, “I’m going to take a bath.”

“You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.”

“Well,” I said, “so long.”

“I guess it isn’t any use,” he said. “I guess it isn’t any damn use.”

“What?”

“Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake.”

“Sure,” I said. “It’s all right.”

“I felt so terribly. I’ve been through such hell, Jake. Now everything’s
gone. Everything.”

“Well,” I said, “so long. I’ve got to go.”

He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.

“So long, Jake,” he said. “You’ll shake hands, won’t you?”

“Sure. Why not?”

We shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well.

“Well,” I said, “see you in the morning.”

“I’m going away in the morning.”

“Oh, yes,” I said.

I went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room.

“Are you all right, Jake?” he asked.

“Oh, yes,” I said. “I’m all right.”

I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a
deep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat
down on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had
taken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them
down-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into
bed.

                 *        *        *        *        *

I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the
street. I remembered I had promised to take Bill’s friend Edna to see
the bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went
down-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing
the square, hurrying toward the bull-ring. Across the square were the
two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting
for the tickets to go on sale at seven o’clock. I hurried across the
street to the café. The waiter told me that my friends had been there
and gone.

“How many were they?”

“Two gentlemen and a lady.”

That was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid
last night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take
her. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the
bull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache.
Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early
morning.

The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was
muddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and
the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with
people. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in
time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the
fence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the
two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They
walked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come
running. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed
him over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a
great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the
boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long
running pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then
another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He
wanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out,
collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the
fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd
and the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the
bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into
the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy,
muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running
crowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man’s arms were by
his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted
him and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front,
but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the
gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the
ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were
pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.

The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People
climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd
was so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each
shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the
degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was
happening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the
bulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started
back toward the town.

Back in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some
buttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off
the tables. One came over and took my order.

“Anything happen at the encierro?”

“I didn’t see it all. One man was badly cogido.”

“Where?”

“Here.” I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my
chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The
waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his
cloth.

“Badly cogido,” he said. “All for sport. All for pleasure.”

He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots.
He poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two
streams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head.

“Badly cogido through the back,” he said. He put the pots down on the
table and sat down in the chair at the table. “A big horn wound. All for
fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?”

“I don’t know.”

“That’s it. All for fun. Fun, you understand.”

“You’re not an aficionado?”

“Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals.” He stood up and put his
hand on the small of his back. “Right through the back. A cornada right
through the back. For fun—you understand.”

He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men
were going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were
grave-looking. One shook his head. “Muerto!” he called.

The waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some
errand. The waiter came over to my table.

“You hear? Muerto. Dead. He’s dead. With a horn through him. All for
morning fun. Es muy flamenco.”

“It’s bad.”

“Not for me,” the waiter said. “No fun in that for me.”

Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named
Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper
we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and
two children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he
was married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the
body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin,
and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the
dancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and
there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin
walked the wife and two children. . . . Behind them marched all the
members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella,
Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin
was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two
children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class
railway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly,
going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields
of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.

The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118
of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by
Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut
by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it
to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left
both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti
cigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that
stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.

                 *        *        *        *        *

Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the
door. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I
came in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been
to the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I
followed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and
lay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the
sunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have
been half past three o’clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had
waked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb
and fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time
he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved
him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one
knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

It was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed.

“Some encierro,” Bill said. “Some encierro.”

“I say, weren’t you there?” Mike asked. “Ring for some beer, Bill.”

“What a morning!” Bill said. He mopped off his face. “My God! what a
morning! And here’s old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag.”

“What happened inside?”

“Good God!” Bill said, “what happened, Mike?”

“There were these bulls coming in,” Mike said. “Just ahead of them was
the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them
down.”

“And the bulls all came in right over them,” Bill said.

“I heard them yell.”

“That was Edna,” Bill said.

“Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts.”

“One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over.”

“They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary,” Mike said.

“What a morning!” Bill said. “The damn police kept arresting chaps that
wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls.”

“The steers took them in, in the end,” Mike said.

“It took about an hour.”

“It was really about a quarter of an hour,” Mike objected.

“Oh, go to hell,” Bill said. “You’ve been in the war. It was two hours
and a half for me.”

“Where’s that beer?” Mike asked.

“What did you do with the lovely Edna?”

“We took her home just now. She’s gone to bed.”

“How did she like it?”

“Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning.”

“She was impressed,” Mike said.

“She wanted us to go down in the ring, too,” Bill said. “She likes
action.”

“I said it wouldn’t be fair to my creditors,” Mike said.

“What a morning,” Bill said. “And what a night!”

“How’s your jaw, Jake?” Mike asked.

“Sore,” I said.

Bill laughed.

“Why didn’t you hit him with a chair?”

“You can talk,” Mike said. “He’d have knocked you out, too. I never saw
him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite
suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a
table.”

“Where did he go afterward?” I asked.

“Here she is,” Mike said. “Here’s the beautiful lady with the beer.”

The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on
the table.

“Now bring up three more bottles,” Mike said.

“Where did Cohn go after he hit me?” I asked Bill.

“Don’t you know about that?” Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured
the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.

“Really?” Bill asked.

“Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the
bull-fighter’s room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody
bull-fighter.”

“No.”

“Yes.”

“What a night!” Bill said.

“He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to
take Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine.
Damned touching scene.”

He took a long drink of the beer.

“He is an ass.”

“What happened?”

“Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather
good.”

“I’ll bet she was,” Bill said.

“Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the
bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.”

“I know. He shook hands with me.”

“Did he? Well, they weren’t having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow
was rather good. He didn’t say much, but he kept getting up and getting
knocked down again. Cohn couldn’t knock him out. It must have been
damned funny.”

“Where did you hear all this?”

“Brett. I saw her this morning.”

“What happened finally?”

“It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He’d been
knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more.
Brett held him and wouldn’t let him get up. He was weak, but Brett
couldn’t hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn’t hit him
again. Said he couldn’t do it. Said it would be wicked. So the
bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back
against the wall.

“‘So you won’t hit me?’

“‘No,’ said Cohn. ‘I’d be ashamed to.’

“So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the
face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn’t get up, Brett said.
Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn
helped him he’d kill him, and he’d kill him anyway this morning if Cohn
wasn’t out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he
wanted to shake hands. I’ve told you that before.”

“Tell the rest,” Bill said.

“It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting
to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn’t having
any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved
her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned
down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you
know. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face
again.”

“That’s quite a kid,” Bill said.

“He ruined Cohn,” Mike said. “You know I don’t think Cohn will ever want
to knock people about again.”

“When did you see Brett?”

“This morning. She came in to get some things. She’s looking after this
Romero lad.”

He poured out another bottle of beer.

“Brett’s rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That’s how
we came to go off together. She was looking after me.”

“I know,” I said.

“I’m rather drunk,” Mike said. “I think I’ll _stay_ rather drunk. This
is all awfully amusing, but it’s not too pleasant. It’s not too pleasant
for me.”

He drank off the beer.

“I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews
and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble.” He leaned
forward. “I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours?
She’ll bring you another one.”

“Please,” I said. “I wasn’t drinking it, anyway.”

Mike started to open the bottle. “Would you mind opening it?” I pressed
up the wire fastener and poured it for him.

“You know,” Mike went on, “Brett was rather good. She’s always rather
good. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all
those sort of people, and do you know what she said: ‘Yes. I’ve had such
a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!’”

He took a drink.

“That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a
sailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn’t sleep in
a bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really
bad, he used to tell her he’d kill her. Always slept with a loaded
service revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he’d gone to
sleep. She hasn’t had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame,
too. She enjoys things so.”

He stood up. His hand was shaky.

“I’m going in the room. Try and get a little sleep.”

He smiled.

“We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I’m going to start now
and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you
frightfully nervy.”

“We’ll see you at noon at the Iruña,” Bill said.

Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.

He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door.

“Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador,” Mike
told her.

“Si, Señorito.”

“I’m going to bed,” Bill said. “Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row
about him last night.”

“Where? At that Milano place?”

“Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of
Cannes, once. He was damned nasty.”

“I know the story.”

“I didn’t. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike.”

“That’s what makes it bad.”

“They oughtn’t to have any right. I wish to hell they didn’t have any
right. I’m going to bed.”

“Was anybody killed in the ring?”

“I don’t think so. Just badly hurt.”

“A man was killed outside in the runway.”

“Was there?” said Bill.




                                CHAPTER
                                   18


At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps
and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big
motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking
around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing
cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it.
They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the
fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the
fiesta.

The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars
made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers
were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport
clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in
black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you
did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there
was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were
going. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on
each other’s shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.

“Here comes Brett,” Bill said.

I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking,
her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and
she found it pleasant and amusing.

“Hello, you chaps!” she said. “I say, I _have_ a thirst.”

“Get another big beer,” Bill said to the waiter.

“Shrimps?”

“Is Cohn gone?” Brett asked.

“Yes,” Bill said. “He hired a car.”

The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook.
She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.

“Good beer.”

“Very good,” I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had
slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be
under control.

“I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake,” Brett said.

“No. Knocked me out. That was all.”

“I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero,” Brett said. “He hurt him most badly.”

“How is he?”

“He’ll be all right. He won’t go out of the room.”

“Does he look badly?”

“Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you
chaps for a minute.”

“Is he going to fight?”

“Rather. I’m going with you, if you don’t mind.”

“How’s your boy friend?” Mike asked. He had not listened to anything
that Brett had said.

“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he
turned out badly.”

Brett stood up.

“I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.”

“How’s your boy friend?”

“Damned well,” Brett said. “Watch him this afternoon.”

“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody
bull-fighter.”

“Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.”

“Tell him all about your bull-fighter,” Mike said. “Oh, to hell with
your bull-fighter!” He tipped the table so that all the beers and the
dish of shrimps went over in a crash.

“Come on,” Brett said. “Let’s get out of this.”

In the crowd crossing the square I said: “How is it?”

“I’m not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come
in and dress him. They’re very angry about me, he says.”

Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was
bright.

“I feel altogether changed,” Brett said. “You’ve no idea, Jake.”

“Anything you want me to do?”

“No, just go to the fight with me.”

“We’ll see you at lunch?”

“No. I’m eating with him.”

We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were
carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.

“Want to take a turn out to the park?” Brett asked. “I don’t want to go
up yet. I fancy he’s sleeping.”

We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through
the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of
booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate.
We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed
people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.

“Don’t let’s go there,” Brett said. “I don’t want staring at just now.”

We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the
clouds from the sea.

“I hope the wind goes down,” Brett said. “It’s very bad for him.”

“So do I.”

“He says the bulls are all right.”

“They’re good.”

“Is that San Fermin’s?”

Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.

“Yes. Where the show started on Sunday.”

“Let’s go in. Do you mind? I’d rather like to pray a little for him or
something.”

We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It
was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes
adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long
wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw
she was looking straight ahead.

“Come on,” she whispered throatily. “Let’s get out of here. Makes me
damned nervous.”

Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the
tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success.

“Don’t know why I get so nervy in church,” Brett said. “Never does me
any good.”

We walked along.

“I’m damned bad for a religious atmosphere,” Brett said. “I’ve the wrong
type of face.

“You know,” Brett said, “I’m not worried about him at all. I just feel
happy about him.”

“Good.”

“I wish the wind would drop, though.”

“It’s liable to go down by five o’clock.”

“Let’s hope.”

“You might pray,” I laughed.

“Never does me any good. I’ve never gotten anything I prayed for. Have
you?”

“Oh, yes.”

“Oh, rot,” said Brett. “Maybe it works for some people, though. You
don’t look very religious, Jake.”

“I’m pretty religious.”

“Oh, rot,” said Brett. “Don’t start proselyting to-day. To-day’s going
to be bad enough as it is.”

It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way
since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the
hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with
people eating.

“Do look after Mike,” Brett said. “Don’t let him get too bad.”

“Your frients haff gone up-stairs,” the German maître d’hôtel said in
English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:

“Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?”

“No, _ma’am_.”

“Good,” said Brett.

“Save us a table for three,” I said to the German. He smiled his dirty
little pink-and-white smile.

“Iss madam eating here?”

“No,” Brett said.

“Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff.”

“Don’t talk to him,” Brett said. “Mike must have been in bad shape,” she
said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did
not smile.

“I’ll see you at the café,” Brett said. “Thank you, so much, Jake.”

We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down
the hall and into Romero’s room. She did not knock. She simply opened
the door, went in, and closed it behind her.

I stood in front of the door of Mike’s room and knocked. There was no
answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great
disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There
were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a
death mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me.

“Hello, Jake,” he said very slowly. “I’m getting a lit tle sleep. I’ve
want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time.”

“Let me cover you over.”

“No. I’m quite warm.”

“Don’t go. I have n’t got ten to sleep yet.”

“You’ll sleep, Mike. Don’t worry, boy.”

“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “But her Jew has gone away.”

He turned his head and looked at me.

“Damned good thing, what?”

“Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.”

“I’m just start ing. I’m go ing to get a lit tle sleep.”

He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly.
Bill was in my room reading the paper.

“See Mike?”

“Yes.”

“Let’s go and eat.”

“I won’t eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned
snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.”

“He was snotty to us, too.”

“Let’s go out and eat in the town.”

We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a
covered tray.

“There goes Brett’s lunch,” Bill said.

“And the kid’s,” I said.

Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up.
His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.

“I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,” he said.

“Go sit at it,” Bill said. We went on out across the street.

We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all
men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and
singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much.
Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the
boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked
in the room and that Mike was asleep.

When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the
crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us
was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of
the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front,
beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow.
It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and
firm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the
callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting
capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and
packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather
sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as
the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the
dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to
spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched
it all. She was absorbed in the professional details.

“He’s his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,” she said. “Why
do they call them muletas?”

“I don’t know.”

“I wonder if they ever launder them.”

“I don’t think so. It might spoil the color.”

“The blood must stiffen them,” Bill said.

“Funny,” Brett said. “How one doesn’t mind the blood.”

Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged
everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full.
There was not an empty seat except in the President’s box. When he came
in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway
that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms
furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in
across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.

“Here, would you like to look?”

I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in
the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them
were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway
and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was
wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I
could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly
marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette
guardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan
and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he
nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were
all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the
grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The
music started. Brett looked through the glasses.

“Here, take them,” she said.

Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened
up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads
back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind
them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the
capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the
picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains
of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their
hats on, before the President’s box, and then came over to the barrera
below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed
it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the
sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero’s lips were puffed, both
eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The
sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and
handed up the cape.

“Spread it out in front of you,” I said.

Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold.
The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man
beside me leaned over toward Brett.

“He doesn’t want you to spread it,” he said. “You should fold it and
keep it in your lap.”

Brett folded the heavy cape.

Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had
sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and
smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over
the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it
and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then
scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.

“What’s that for?” Brett asked.

“To give it weight in the wind.”

“His face looks bad,” Bill said.

“He feels very badly,” Brett said. “He should be in bed.”

The first bull was Belmonte’s. Belmonte was very good. But because he
got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to
buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than
very good. Belmonte’s great attraction is working close to the bull. In
bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of
the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he
is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull
he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the
terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.
People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic
sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago
they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he
was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls.
When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been,
and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because
no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to
have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.

Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not
be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element
that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and
the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick
with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded
and cheated, and Belmonte’s jaw came further out in contempt, and his
face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain
increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was
utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great
afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults,
and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables,
thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs.
His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that
toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something
particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced
grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment
color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and
cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same
wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the
barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into
the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms,
not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he
looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a
little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back
into the ring.

Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the
moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him.
Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He
paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all
about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it
was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with
Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he
knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by
the false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he
would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been
spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully,
what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The
crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American
ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not
enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte
was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the
bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things
were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of
the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he
had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for
their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking
over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had
two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the
greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was
always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did
not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make
bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.

Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he
loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he
could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon.
Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for
himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if
it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him,
and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss
to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.

His first “quite” was directly below us. The three matadors take the
bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the
first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were
standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his
eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in
the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the
horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he
watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel
point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head.
He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught
the bull’s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not
the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the
horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of
muscle on the bull’s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he
pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull’s
shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.

The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at
the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him
out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped
and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The
bull’s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of
the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape
swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just
ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other
again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero’s cape filled
again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so
close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted
ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow
and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep.
He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that
turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand
on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going
away.

In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After
the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the
vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant
bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the
bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with
a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order
him replaced.

“Why don’t they change him?” Brett asked.

“They’ve paid for him. They don’t want to lose their money.”

“It’s hardly fair to Romero.”

“Watch how he handles a bull that can’t see the color.”

“It’s the sort of thing I don’t like to see.”

It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was
doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or
the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent
with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and
would start for it, and then shift the bull’s charge to the flannel and
finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not
like it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that
little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull’s charge from his
own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte’s imitation of himself
or Marcial’s imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row
behind us.

“What’s he afraid of the bull for? The bull’s so dumb he only goes after
the cloth.”

“He’s just a young bull-fighter. He hasn’t learned it yet.”

“But I thought he was fine with the cape before.”

“Probably he’s nervous now.”

Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the
same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly,
offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching
dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again
and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came,
giving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost
imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the
Biarritz bull-fight experts.

“He’s going to kill now,” I said to Brett. “The bull’s still strong. He
wouldn’t wear himself out.”

Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew
the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and
sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero’s
left hand dropped the muleta over the bull’s muzzle to blind him, his
left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and
for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the
bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had
gone in between the bull’s shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There
was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one
hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve,
the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight
between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.

“There he goes,” Bill said.

Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he
spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward
and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.

They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta
in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President’s box,
bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the
sword and muleta.

“Bad one,” said the sword-handler.

“He made me sweat,” said Romero. He wiped off his face. The
sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt
him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.

Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero’s last
bull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man
in the morning running.

During Romero’s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable.
Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly
delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.
The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been
smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing
that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a
good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged
easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.

When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the
crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did
not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in
bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow,
templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There
was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a
sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.

The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed
directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last
bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull,
drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the
blade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of
his feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta
held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a
step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between
the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that
disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The
bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from
side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero’s older
brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the
bull’s neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove
the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid.
Romero’s brother, holding the bull’s horn in one hand, the knife in the
other, looked up at the President’s box. Handkerchiefs were waving all
over the bull-ring. The President looked down from the box and waved his
handkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull
and trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the
sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the
arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance
around the bull.

Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the
President. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the
crowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear
to Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him.
Brett held down the cape.

“You liked it?” Romero called.

Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett
had the ear in her hand.

“Don’t get bloody,” Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him.
Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and
the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were
all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He
fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them,
toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people’s shoulders.
But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were
spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all
running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody’s shoulder. He
looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the
gate with him.

We all three went back to the hotel. Brett went up-stairs. Bill and I
sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and
drank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes
with his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate.
Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o’clock train
for Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and
ate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk.
He only answered questions.

Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight
very hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people
at his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.

“Come on over to the café,” Bill said. “I want an absinthe.”

It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy
again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were
making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with
beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with
long bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music
and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.

“Where’s Edna?” I asked Bill.

“I don’t know.”

We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta.
The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in
the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.

“I feel sorry about Cohn,” Bill said. “He had an awful time.”

“Oh, to hell with Cohn,” I said.

“Where do you suppose he went?”

“Up to Paris.”

“What do you suppose he’ll do?”

“Oh, to hell with him.”

“What do you suppose he’ll do?”

“Pick up with his old girl, probably.”

“Who was his old girl?”

“Somebody named Frances.”

We had another absinthe.

“When do you go back?” I asked.

“To-morrow.”

After a little while Bill said: “Well, it was a swell fiesta.”

“Yes,” I said; “something doing all the time.”

“You wouldn’t believe it. It’s like a wonderful nightmare.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’d believe anything. Including nightmares.”

“What’s the matter? Feel low?”

“Low as hell.”

“Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor.”

“I feel like hell,” I said.

“Drink that,” said Bill. “Drink it slow.”

It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel
drunk but I did not feel any better.

“How do you feel?”

“I feel like hell.”

“Have another?”

“It won’t do any good.”

“Try it. You can’t tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey,
waiter! Another absinthe for this señor!”

I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it
drip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon
in the brownish, cloudy mixture.

“How is it?”

“Fine.”

“Don’t drink it fast that way. It will make you sick.”

I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.

“I feel tight.”

“You ought to.”

“That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?”

“Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.”

“Well, I’m tight. Is that what you want?”

“Sit down.”

“I won’t sit down,” I said. “I’m going over to the hotel.”

I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At
the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett’s door was open. I put my head in the
room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.

“Jake,” he said. “Come in, Jake.”

I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some
fixed point.

“Brett, you know. She’s gone off with the bull-fighter chap.”

“No.”

“Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o’clock
train.”

“Did they?”

“Bad thing to do,” Mike said. “She shouldn’t have done it.”

“No.”

“Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.”

“I’m drunk,” I said. “I’m going in and lie down.”

“Are you blind? I was blind myself.”

“Yes,” I said, “I’m blind.”

“Well, bung-o,” Mike said. “Get some sleep, old Jake.”

I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed
went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it
stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean
anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with
them. I pretended to be asleep.

“He’s asleep. Better let him alone.”

“He’s blind as a tick,” Mike said. They went out.

I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the
square. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and
bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I
looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the
dining-room.

“Here he is!” said Bill. “Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn’t pass out.”

“Hello, you old drunk,” Mike said.

“I got hungry and woke up.”

“Eat some soup,” Bill said.

The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six
people were missing.




                                BOOK III




                                CHAPTER
                                   19


In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about
nine o’clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was
empty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were
picking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafés were just opening and
the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and
arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the
arcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.

I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The
waiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the
unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were
still up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron
came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down
the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing
away the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.

I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come
walking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a
coffee.

“Well,” he said, “it’s all over.”

“Yes,” I said. “When do you go?”

“I don’t know. We better get a car, I think. Aren’t you going back to
Paris?”

“No. I can stay away another week. I think I’ll go to San Sebastian.”

“I want to get back.”

“What’s Mike going to do?”

“He’s going to Saint Jean de Luz.”

“Let’s get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up
from there to-night.”

“Good. Let’s go after lunch.”

“All right. I’ll get the car.”

We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the
maids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and
strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the
front seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through
the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from
Pamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of
Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and
out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet,
green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill’s baggage
at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at
seven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in
front.

“What shall we do about the car?” Bill asked.

“Oh, bother the car,” Mike said. “Let’s just keep the car with us.”

“All right,” Bill said. “Where shall we go?”

“Let’s go to Biarritz and have a drink.”

“Old Mike the spender,” Bill said.

We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We
went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.

“That drink’s mine,” Mike said.

“Let’s roll for it.”

So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out
first roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc
note. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and
Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room
off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar.
We had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill
and Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the
second. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He
handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there
were three kings, an ace, and a queen.

“It’s yours, Mike,” Bill said. “Old Mike, the gambler.”

“I’m so sorry,” Mike said. “I can’t get it.”

“What’s the matter?”

“I’ve no money,” Mike said. “I’m stony. I’ve just twenty francs. Here,
take twenty francs.”

Bill’s face sort of changed.

“I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too.”

“I’ll cash you a check,” Bill said.

“That’s damned nice of you, but you see I can’t write checks.”

“What are you going to do for money?”

“Oh, some will come through. I’ve two weeks allowance should be here. I
can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean.”

“What do you want to do about the car?” Bill asked me. “Do you want to
keep it on?”

“It doesn’t make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic.”

“Come on, let’s have another drink,” Mike said.

“Fine. This one is on me,” Bill said. “Has Brett any money?” He turned
to Mike.

“I shouldn’t think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.”

“She hasn’t any money with her?” I asked.

“I shouldn’t think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred
quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.”

“I suppose they get it at the source,” said Bill.

“Quite. They’re not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They’re
Scotsmen, I believe.”

“Hasn’t she any at all with her?” I asked.

“I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left.”

“Well,” Bill said, “we might as well have another drink.”

“Damned good idea,” Mike said. “One never gets anywhere by discussing
finances.”

“No,” said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost
and paid. We went out to the car.

“Anywhere you’d like to go, Mike?” Bill asked.

“Let’s take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let’s drive about a
little.”

“Fine. I’d like to see the coast. Let’s drive down toward Hendaye.”

“I haven’t any credit along the coast.”

“You can’t ever tell,” said Bill.

We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands,
the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue
with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We
drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down
the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the
mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill
looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the
glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out
into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch
of meadow, then the sea.

At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the
car and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the
side of the car.

“Good-bye, you chaps,” Mike said. “It was a damned fine fiesta.”

“So long, Mike,” Bill said.

“I’ll see you around,” I said.

“Don’t worry about money,” Mike said. “You can pay for the car, Jake,
and I’ll send you my share.”

“So long, Mike.”

“So long, you chaps. You’ve been damned nice.”

We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road
watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried
Bill’s bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the
tracks.

“So long, fella,” Bill said.

“So long, kid!”

“It was swell. I’ve had a swell time.”

“Will you be in Paris?”

“No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!”

“So long, old kid!”

He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the
bags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The
window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty.
I went outside to the car.

“How much do we owe you?” I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had
been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.

“Two hundred pesetas.”

“How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way
back?”

“Fifty pesetas.”

“Don’t kid me.”

“Thirty-five pesetas.”

“It’s not worth it,” I said. “Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri.”

At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered
with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last
thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the
car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the
road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the
same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That
seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in
the town.

At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York _Herald_ and sat
in a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a
safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill,
except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with
fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does
not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and
swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the
promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with
their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be
band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit
in the Marinas and listen.

“How does one eat inside?” I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a
restaurant.

“Well. Very well. One eats very well.”

“Good.”

I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed
very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for
company. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly
and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine
was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a
Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a
liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the
Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil
and smelled like Italian _strega_. I told him to take the flowers of the
Pyrenees away and bring me a _vieux marc_. The _marc_ was good. I had a
second _marc_ after the coffee.

The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees,
so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a
country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell
whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear
financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one
makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason.
If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I
spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable
qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again
some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his
table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis.
I was back in France.

Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make
more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the
station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not
think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French
friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there
again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be
loyal.

At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave
France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going
back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like
a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport,
opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate,
climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was
at San Sebastian.

Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The
trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel
as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on
certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where
I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened
out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond
the roofs.

I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of
the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big
armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in
the bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to
summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an
hour by coming to San Sebastian.

As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police
bulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms,
and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all
mail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I
would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking
them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six
days. Then I went in and had lunch.

After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When
I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with
a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the
Concha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm,
and the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my
suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm
under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the
beach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form
the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although
the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like
undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke
smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller
came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the
chill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot
planks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the
top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay
face downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he
said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun
until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming
down to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark.
The raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled
up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay
on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off
my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.

I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up
one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas. There was an orchestra
playing inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the
fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved
ice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for
a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.

Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out
along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was
a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping
that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was
a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers.
They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their
meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were
two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre
chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in
slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes
at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them.
The next morning at five o’clock the race resumed with the last lap, San
Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned
and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except
among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did
not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The
money could be arranged.

The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack
of boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His
neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders
joked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork.

“Listen,” he said, “to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars
that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.”

One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned
red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.

I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big
bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and
would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at
Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than
in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said.
Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de
France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and
organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know
France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with
bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed
the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and
more _sportif_ every year. It would be the most _sportif_ country in the
world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew
France. _La France Sportive._ He knew road-racing. We had a cognac.
After all, though, it wasn’t bad to get back to Paris. There is only one
Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most _sportif_
in the world. Did I know the _Chope de Negre_? Did I not. I would see
him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another _fine_
together. We certainly would. They started at six o’clock less a quarter
in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to.
Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a
call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take
the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until
the next morning.

In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars
had been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed
and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything
was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and
in peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish
children were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree
talking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and
there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.

I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach
and went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers,
but having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and
floated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the
swells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big
roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have
a wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I
turned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt
as though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long
swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat,
dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked
around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the
promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered
names. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill
with a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the
other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high
headland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid
of cramp.

I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very
small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the
raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come
up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and
swam slowly and steadily in to shore.

After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to
the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of _L’Auto_
around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and
sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French
sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a
blue envelope in his hand.

“A telegram for you, sir.”

I poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it
open, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris:

                  COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID
                  AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.

I tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming
along the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and
looked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was
just behind him.

“Here’s another telegram for you, sir.”

“Thank you,” I said.

I opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.

                  COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID
                  AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.

The concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably.

“What time is there a train for Madrid?”

“It left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the
Sud Express at ten to-night.”

“Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?”

“Just as you wish,” he said. “I will have it put on the bill.”

“Do that.”

Well, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I
had expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the
doorway.

“Bring me a telegram form, please.”

He brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:

                   LADY ASHLEY HOTEL MONTANA MADRID
                   ARRIVING SUD EXPRESS TOMORROW LOVE
                   JAKE.

That seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man.
Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back.
And sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch.

I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had
breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country
between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray
and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw
Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a
little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.

The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish
there. They don’t go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line
of hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we
climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished
church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high,
hot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta
del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San
Jeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The
windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped
at the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The
taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could
not make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a
cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I
rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.

“Is Lady Ashley here?” I asked.

She looked at me dully.

“Is an Englishwoman here?”

She turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the
door. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face.
She was short and commanding.

“Muy buenos,” I said. “Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to
see this English lady.”

“Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her
if she wishes to see you.”

“She wishes to see me.”

“The chica will ask her.”

“It is very hot.”

“It is very hot in the summer in Madrid.”

“And how cold in winter.”

“Yes, it is very cold in winter.”

Did I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana?

Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags
were brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be
stolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas,
yes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly
selectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the
upbringal of my bags.

The maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male
English now, at once.

“Good,” I said. “You see. It is as I said.”

“Clearly.”

I followed the maid’s back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she
knocked on a door.

“Hello,” said Brett. “Is it you, Jake?”

“It’s me.”

“Come in. Come in.”

I opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She
had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room
was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had
servants.

“Darling!” Brett said.

I went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and
while she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She
was trembling in my arms. She felt very small.

“Darling! I’ve had such a hell of a time.”

“Tell me about it.”

“Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go.”

“Why didn’t you keep him?”

“I don’t know. It isn’t the sort of thing one does. I don’t think I hurt
him any.”

“You were probably damn good for him.”

“He shouldn’t be living with any one. I realized that right away.”

“No.”

“Oh, hell!” she said, “let’s not talk about it. Let’s never talk about
it.”

“All right.”

“It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for
a while, you know.”

“No.”

“Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the café, I guess. He wanted me to
grow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I’d look so like hell.”

“It’s funny.”

“He said it would make me more womanly. I’d look a fright.”

“What happened?”

“Oh, he got over that. He wasn’t ashamed of me long.”

“What was it about being in trouble?”

“I didn’t know whether I could make him go, and I didn’t have a sou to
go away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I
told him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn’t take his
money, you know.”

“No.”

“Oh, let’s not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do
give me a cigarette.”

I lit the cigarette.

“He learned his English as a waiter in Gib.”

“Yes.”

“He wanted to marry me, finally.”

“Really?”

“Of course. I can’t even marry Mike.”

“Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley.”

“No. It wasn’t that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn’t go away
from him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from
him. After I’d gotten more womanly, of course.”

“You ought to feel set up.”

“I do. I’m all right again. He’s wiped out that damned Cohn.”

“Good.”

“You know I’d have lived with him if I hadn’t seen it was bad for him.
We got along damned well.”

“Outside of your personal appearance.”

“Oh, he’d have gotten used to that.”

She put out the cigarette.

“I’m thirty-four, you know. I’m not going to be one of these bitches
that ruins children.”

“No.”

“I’m not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel
rather set up.”

“Good.”

She looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I
saw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She
wouldn’t look up. I put my arms around her.

“Don’t let’s ever talk about it. Please don’t let’s ever talk about it.”

“Dear Brett.”

“I’m going back to Mike.” I could feel her crying as I held her close.
“He’s so damned nice and he’s so awful. He’s my sort of thing.”

She would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking.

“I won’t be one of those bitches,” she said. “But, oh, Jake, please
let’s never talk about it.”

We left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me
pay the bill. The bill had been paid.

“Oh, well. Let it go,” Brett said. “It doesn’t matter now.”

We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for
berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the
hotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman
shook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker.

“It’s funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big
hotel,” I said.

“Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more.”

“No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice.”

“It’s odd.”

“Bartenders have always been fine.”

“You know,” Brett said, “it’s quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn’t it
amazing?”

We touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They
were coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of
Madrid.

“I like an olive in a Martini,” I said to the barman.

“Right you are, sir. There you are.”

“Thanks.”

“I should have asked, you know.”

The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our
conversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the
wood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after
that first sip.

“It’s good. Isn’t it a nice bar?”

“They’re all nice bars.”

“You know I didn’t believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in
school in Paris, then. Think of that.”

“Anything you want me to think about it?”

“Don’t be an ass. _Would_ you buy a lady a drink?”

“We’ll have two more Martinis.”

“As they were before, sir?”

“They were very good.” Brett smiled at him.

“Thank you, ma’am.”

“Well, bung-o,” Brett said.

“Bung-o!”

“You know,” Brett said, “he’d only been with two women before. He never
cared about anything but bull-fighting.”

“He’s got plenty of time.”

“I don’t know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.”

“Well, it was you.”

“Yes. It was me.”

“I thought you weren’t going to ever talk about it.”

“How can I help it?”

“You’ll lose it if you talk about it.”

“I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.”

“You should.”

“You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.”

“Yes.”

“It’s sort of what we have instead of God.”

“Some people have God,” I said. “Quite a lot.”

“He never worked very well with me.”

“Should we have another Martini?”

The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh
glasses.

“Where will we have lunch?” I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could
feel the heat outside through the window.

“Here?” asked Brett.

“It’s rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin’s?” I
asked the barman.

“Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?”

“Thank you.”

We lunched up-stairs at Botin’s. It is one of the best restaurants in
the world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank _rioja_ _alta_.
Brett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and
drank three bottles of _rioja alta_.

“How do you feel, Jake?” Brett asked. “My God! what a meal you’ve
eaten.”

“I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?”

“Lord, no.”

Brett was smoking.

“You like to eat, don’t you?” she said.

“Yes.” I said. “I like to do a lot of things.”

“What do you like to do?”

“Oh,” I said, “I like to do a lot of things. Don’t you want a dessert?”

“You asked me that once,” Brett said.

“Yes,” I said. “So I did. Let’s have another bottle of _rioja alta_.”

“It’s very good.”

“You haven’t drunk much of it,” I said.

“I have. You haven’t seen.”

“Let’s get two bottles,” I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in
my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched
glasses.

“Bung-o!” Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put
her hand on my arm.

“Don’t get drunk, Jake,” she said. “You don’t have to.”

“How do you know?”

“Don’t,” she said. “You’ll be all right.”

“I’m not getting drunk,” I said. “I’m just drinking a little wine. I
like to drink wine.”

“Don’t get drunk,” she said. “Jake, don’t get drunk.”

“Want to go for a ride?” I said. “Want to ride through the town?”

“Right,” Brett said. “I haven’t seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.”

“I’ll finish this,” I said.

Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the
street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street
was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked.
A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped
him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The
driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me.
We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested
against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses
looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.

“Oh, Jake,” Brett said, “we could have had such a damned good time
together.”

Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his
baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.

“Yes,” I said. “Isn’t it pretty to think so?”

Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of _Eden_, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top
Of _Oreb_, or of _Sinai_, didst inspire
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth
Rose out of _Chaos_: Or if _Sion_ Hill
Delight thee more, and _Siloa’s_ Brook that flow’d
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th’ _Aonian_ Mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
Before all Temples th’ upright heart and pure,
Instruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark
Illumine, what is low raise and support;
That to the highth of this great Argument
I may assert th’ Eternal Providence,
And justifie the wayes of God to men.

Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause
Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,
Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off
From their Creator, and transgress his Will
For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?
Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt?
Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride
Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,
He trusted to have equal’d the most High,
If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God
Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud
With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power
Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie
With hideous ruine and combustion down
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,
Who durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe
Confounded though immortal: But his doom
Reserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witness’d huge affliction and dismay
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:
At once as far as Angels kenn he views
The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
As one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
Serv’d only to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all; but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d
In utter darkness, and their portion set
As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n
As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.
O how unlike the place from whence they fell!
There the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side
One next himself in power, and next in crime,
Long after known in _Palestine_, and nam’d
_Beelzebub_.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,
And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence thus began.

If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light
Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest
From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict do I repent or change,
Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind
And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,
That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,
And to the fierce contention brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,
And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?
That Glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,
Since through experience of this great event
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.

So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:
And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.

O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;
And put to proof his high Supremacy,
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
Too well I see and rue the dire event,
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host
In horrible destruction laid thus low,
As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state
Here swallow’d up in endless misery.
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now
Of force believe Almighty, since no less
Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
Or do him mightier service as his thralls
By right of Warr, what e’re his business be
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
What can it then avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being
To undergo eternal punishment?
Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.

Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,
To do ought good never will be our task,
But ever to do ill our sole delight,
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist.  If then his Providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
Our labour must be to pervert that end,
And out of good still to find means of evil;
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
His inmost counsels from their destind aim.
But see the angry Victor hath recall’d
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice
Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,
Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,
The seat of desolation, voyd of light,
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,
And reassembling our afflicted Powers,
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,
How overcome this dire Calamity,
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,
If not what resolution from despare.

Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes
That sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,
_Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warr’d on _Jove_,
_Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den
By ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast
_Leviathan_, which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:
Him haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam
The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence
Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
Left him at large to his own dark designs,
That with reiterated crimes he might
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
Evil to others, and enrag’d might see
How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn
On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames
Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld
In billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land
He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;
And such appear’d in hue, as when the force
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill
Torn from _Pelorus_, or the shatter’d side
Of thundring _Aetna_, whose combustible
And fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,
Sublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,
And leave a singed bottom all involv’d
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole
Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,
Both glorying to have scap’t the _Stygian_ flood
As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.

Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat
That we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom
For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
What shall be right: fardest from him is best
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings
A mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.
The mind is its own place, and in it self
Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.
What matter where, if I be still the same,
And what I should be, all but less then hee
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least
We shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Th’ associates and copartners of our loss
Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?

So _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_
Thus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,
Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge
Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults
Their surest signal, they will soon resume
New courage and revive, though now they lye
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,
No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.

He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
Behind him cast; the broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
Through Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views
At Ev’ning from the top of _Fesole_,
Or in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands,
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine
Hewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,
He walkt with to support uneasie steps
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
Nathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks
In _Vallombrosa_, where th’ _Etrurian_ shades
High overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge
Afloat, when with fierce Winds _Orion_ arm’d
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew
_Busiris_ and his _Memphian_ Chivalrie,
VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d
The Sojourners of _Goshen_, who beheld
From the safe shore their floating Carkases
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
Under amazement of their hideous change.
He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep
Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,
If such astonishment as this can sieze
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place
After the toyl of Battel to repose
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood
With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon
His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern
Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.

They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd
Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod
Of _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day
Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud
Of _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind,
That ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung
Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of _Nile_:
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell
’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Thir course, in even ballance down they light
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
A multitude, like which the populous North
Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass
_Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
Beneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands.
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now
Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
Nor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,
By falsities and lyes the greatest part
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator, and th’ invisible
Glory of him, that made them, to transform
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
And Devils to adore for Deities:
Then were they known to men by various Names,
And various Idols through the Heathen World.
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,
Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d
Among the Nations round, and durst abide
_Jehovah_ thundring out of _Sion_, thron’d
Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d
Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,
Abominations; and with cursed things
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,
And with their darkness durst affront his light.
First _Moloch_, horrid King besmear’d with blood
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud
Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire
To his grim Idol.  Him the _Ammonite_
Worshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain,
In _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream
Of utmost _Arnon_.  Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
Of _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build
His Temple right against the Temple of God
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
The pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence
And black _Gehenna_ call’d, the Type of Hell.
Next _Chemos_, th’ obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons,
From _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild
Of Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_
And _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond
The flowry Dale of _Sibma_ clad with Vines,
And _Eleale_ to th’ _Asphaltick_ Pool.
_Peor_ his other Name, when he entic’d
_Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove
Of _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate;
Till good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell.
With these came they, who from the bordring flood
Of old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts
_Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names
Of _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male,
These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,
Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,
Can execute their aerie purposes,
And works of love or enmity fulfill.
For those the Race of _Israel_ oft forsook
Their living strength, and unfrequented left
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low
Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear
Of despicable foes.  With these in troop
Came _Astoreth_, whom the _Phoenicians_ call’d
_Astarte_, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon
_Sidonian_ Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,
In _Sion_ also not unsung, where stood
Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell
To Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind,
Whose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allur’d
The _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
While smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood
Of _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale
Infected _Sions_ daughters with like heat,
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch
_Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led
His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries
Of alienated _Judah_.  Next came one
Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark
Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,
Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:
_Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high
Rear’d in _Azotus_, dreaded through the Coast
Of _Palestine_, in _Gath_ and _Ascalon_,
And _Accaron_ and _Gaza’s_ frontier bounds.
Him follow’d _Rimmon_, whose delightful Seat
Was fair _Damscus_, on the fertil Banks
Of _Abbana_ and _Pharphar_, lucid streams.
He also against the house of God was bold:
A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,
_Ahaz_ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew
Gods Altar to disparage and displace
For one of _Syrian_ mode, whereon to burn
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods
Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d
A crew who under Names of old Renown,
_Osiris_, _Isis_, _Orus_ and their Train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d
Fanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek
Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms
Rather then human.  Nor did _Israel_ scape
Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d
The Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King
Doubl’d that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_,
Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,
_Jehovah_, who in one Night when he pass’d
From _Egypt_ marching, equal’d with one stroke
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.
_Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
Turns Atheist, as did _Ely’s_ Sons, who fill’d
With lust and violence the house of God.
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,
And injury and outrage: And when Night
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
Of _Belial_, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the Streets of _Sodom_, and that night
In _Gibeah_, when hospitable Dores
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.
These were the prime in order and in might;
The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,
Th’ _Ionian_ Gods, of _Javans_ Issue held
Gods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth
Thir boasted Parents; _Titan_ Heav’ns first born
With his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d
By younger _Saturn_, he from mightier _Jove_
His own and _Rhea’s_ Son like measure found;
So _Jove_ usurping reign’d: these first in _Creet_
And _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top
Of cold _Olympus_ rul’d the middle Air
Thir highest Heav’n; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff,
Or in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds
Of _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old
Fled over _Adria_ to th’ _Hesperian_ Fields,
And ore the _Celtic_ roam’d the utmost Isles.
All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d
Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d
_Azazel_ as his right, a Cherube tall:
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld
Th’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:
At which the universal Host upsent
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
Frighted the Reign of _Chaos_ and old Night.
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move
In perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d
To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage
Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they
Breathing united force with fixed thought
Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d
Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now
Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise
Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief
Had to impose: He through the armed Files
Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,
Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength
Glories: For never since created man,
Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these
Could merit more then that small infantry
Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood
Of _Phlegra_ with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d
That fought at _Theb’s_ and _Ilium_, on each side
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds
In Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son
Begirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights;
And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel
Jousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_,
_Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_,
Or whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore
When _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell
By _Fontarabbia_.  Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d
Thir dread Commander: he above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost
All her Original brightness, nor appear’d
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess
Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds
On half the Nations, and with fear of change
Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon
Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d
For ever now to have their lot in pain,
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t
Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,
Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire
Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,
With singed top their stately growth though bare
Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d
To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend
From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round
With all his Peers: attention held them mute.
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last
Words interwove with sighs found out their way.

O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers
Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife
Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,
As this place testifies, and this dire change
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth
Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,
How such united force of Gods, how such
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile
Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend
Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.
For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,
If counsels different, or danger shun’d
By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns
Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,
Consent or custome, and his Regal State
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own
So as not either to provoke, or dread
New warr, provok’t; our better part remains
To work in close design, by fraud or guile
What force effected not: that he no less
At length from us may find, who overcomes
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long
Intended to create, and therein plant
A generation, whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse
Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,
For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr
Open or understood must be resolv’d.

He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s
Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.

There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top
Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,
The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed
A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,
Or cast a Rampart.  _Mammon_ led them on,
_Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell
From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks & thoughts
Were always downward bent, admiring more
The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,
Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d
In vision beatific: by him first
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,
Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands
Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth
For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew
Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound
And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best
Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those
Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell
Of _Babel_, and the works of _Memphian_ Kings,
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,
And Strength and Art are easily outdone
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour
What in an age they with incessant toyle
And hands innumerable scarce perform
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,
Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:
A third as soon had form’d within the ground
A various mould, and from the boyling cells
By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,
As in an Organ from one blast of wind
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,
Built like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,
The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not _Babilon_,
Nor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence
Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine
_Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat
Thir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove
In wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores
Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide
Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth
And level pavement: from the arched roof
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed
With Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light
As from a sky.  The hasty multitude
Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise
And some the Architect: his hand was known
In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,
Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.
Nor was his name unheard or unador’d
In ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land
Men call’d him _Mulciber_; and how he fell
From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry _Jove_
Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,
On _Lemnos_ th’ _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate,
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now
To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in hell.
Mean while the winged Haralds by command
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held
At _Pandaemonium_, the high Capital
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d
From every and Band squared Regiment
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall
(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold
Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair
Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)
Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,
New rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer
Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd
Swarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race
Beyond the _Indian_ Mount, or Faerie Elves,
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side
Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,
Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
Reduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,
Though without number still amidst the Hall
Of that infernal Court.  But far within
And in thir own dimensions like themselves
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
In close recess and secret conclave sat
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,
Frequent and full.  After short silence then
And summons read, the great consult began.

      THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK II.

High on a Throne of Royal State, which far
Outshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_,
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
Showrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl & Gold,
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais’d
To that bad eminence; and from despair
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
Vain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught
His proud imaginations thus displaid.

Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,
For since no deep within her gulf can hold
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,
I give not Heav’n for lost.  From this descent
Celestial vertues rising, will appear
More glorious and more dread then from no fall,
And trust themselves to fear no second fate:
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n
Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss
Thus farr at least recover’d, hath much more
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne
Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state
In Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw
Envy from each inferior; but who here
Will envy whom the highest place exposes
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share
Of endless pain? where there is then no good
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there
From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind
Will covet more.  With this advantage then
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,
More then can be in Heav’n, we now return
To claim our just inheritance of old,
Surer to prosper then prosperity
Could have assur’d us; and by what best way,
Whether of open Warr or covert guile,
We now debate; who can advise, may speak.

He ceas’d, and next him _Moloc_, Scepter’d King
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
That fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair:
His trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d
Equal in strength, and rather then be less
Car’d not to be at all; with that care lost
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse
He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.

My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here
Heav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns
By our delay? no, let us rather choose
Arm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once
O’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way,
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self
Mixt with _Tartarean_ Sulphur, and strange fire,
His own invented Torments.  But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe.
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,
That in our proper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat: descent and fall
To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear
Insulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,
With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sunk thus low?  Th’ ascent is easie then;
Th’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find
To our destruction: if there be in Hell
Fear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse
Then to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;
Where pain of unextinguishable fire
Must exercise us without hope of end
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge
Inexorably, and the torturing houre
Calls us to Penance?  More destroy’d then thus
We should be quite abolisht and expire.
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d,
Will either quite consume us, and reduce
To nothing this essential, happier farr
Then miserable to have eternal being:
Or if our substance be indeed Divine,
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.

He ended frowning, and his look denounc’d
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous
To less then Gods.  On th’ other side up rose
_Belial_, in act more graceful and humane;
A fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd
For dignity compos’d and high exploit:
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear
The better reason, to perplex and dash
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the eare,
And with perswasive accent thus began.

I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,
As not behind in hate; if what was urg’d
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole success:
When he who most excels in fact of Arms,
In what he counsels and in what excels
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution, as the scope
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d
With Armed watch, that render all access
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,
Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise
With blackest Insurrection, to confound
Heav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie
All incorruptible would on his Throne
Sit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould
Incapable of stain would soon expel
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire
Victorious.  Thus repuls’d, our final hope
Is flat despair: we must exasperate
Th’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,
And that must end us, that must be our cure,
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost
In the wide womb of uncreated night,
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
Can give it, or will ever? how he can
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,
Belike through impotence, or unaware,
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,
Reserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe;
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?
What when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook
With Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay
Chain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.
What if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires
Awak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again
His red right hand to plague us? what if all
Her stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;
There to converse with everlasting groans,
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.
Warr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
Views all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth
All these our motions vain, sees and derides;
Not more Almighty to resist our might
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n
Thus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here
Chains & these Torments? better these then worse
By my advice; since fate inevitable
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,
The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust
That so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,
If we were wise, against so great a foe
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold
And vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear
What yet they know must follow, to endure
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d
Not mind us not offending, satisfi’d
With what is punish’t; whence these raging fires
Will slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames.
Our purer essence then will overcome
Thir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,
Or chang’d at length, and to the place conformd
In temper and in nature, will receive
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,
Besides what hope the never-ending flight
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,
If we procure not to our selves more woe.

Thus _Belial_ with words cloath’d in reasons garb
Counsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,
Not peace: and after him thus _Mammon_ spake.

Either to disinthrone the King of Heav’n
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild
To fickle Chance, and _Chaos_ judge the strife:
The former vain to hope argues as vain
The latter: for what place can be for us
Within Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream
We overpower?  Suppose he should relent
And publish Grace to all, on promise made
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble, and receive
Strict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne
With warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing
Forc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,
Our servile offerings.  This must be our task
In Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom
Eternity so spent in worship paid
To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue
By force impossible, by leave obtain’d
Unacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek
Our own good from our selves, and from our own
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,
Free, and to none accountable, preferring
Hard liberty before the easie yoke
Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse
We can create, and in what place so e’re
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain
Through labour and endurance.  This deep world
Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d,
And with the Majesty of darkness round
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar
Must’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light
Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise
Magnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires
As soft as now severe, our temper chang’d
Into their temper; which must needs remove
The sensible of pain.  All things invite
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State
Of order, how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils, with regard
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite
All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.

He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld
Th’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long
Had rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay
After the Tempest: Such applause was heard
As _Mammon_ ended, and his Sentence pleas’d,
Advising peace: for such another Field
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear
Of Thunder and the Sword of _Michael_
Wrought still within them; and no less desire
To found this nether Empire, which might rise
By pollicy, and long process of time,
In emulation opposite to Heav’n.
Which when _Beelzebub_ perceiv’d, then whom,
_Satan_ except, none higher sat, with grave
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven
Deliberation sat and publick care;
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood
With _Atlantean_ shoulders fit to bear
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look
Drew audience and attention still as Night
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.

Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n,
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call’d
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,
And know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt
From Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine
In strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d,
Under th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d
His captive multitude: For he, be sure,
In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part
By our revolt, but over Hell extend
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n.
What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?
Warr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none
Voutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n
To us enslav’d, but custody severe,
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment
Inflicted? and what peace can we return,
But to our power hostility and hate,
Untam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow,
Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce
In doing what we most in suffering feel?
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need
With dangerous expedition to invade
Heav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,
Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find
Some easier enterprize?  There is a place
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n
Err not) another World, the happy seat
Of som new Race call’d _Man_, about this time
To be created like to us, though less
In power and excellence, but favour’d more
Of him who rules above; so was his will
Pronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,
That shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,
Or substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,
And where thir weakness, how attempted best,
By force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,
And Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength, this place may lye expos’d
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps
Som advantagious act may be achiev’d
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire
To waste his whole Creation, or possess
All as our own, and drive as we were driven,
The punie habitants, or if not drive,
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works.  This would surpass
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons
Hurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse
Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,
Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain Empires.  Thus _Beelzebub_
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d
By _Satan_, and in part propos’d: for whence,
But from the Author of all ill could Spring
So deep a malice, to confound the race
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve, done all to spite
The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves
His glory to augment.  The bold design
Pleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy
Sparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.

Well have ye judg’d, well ended long debate,
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,
Great things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Re-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires
Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send
In search of this new world, whom shall we find
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet
The dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight
Upborn with indefatigable wings
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick
Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need
All circumspection, and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,
The weight of all and our last hope relies.

This said, he sat; and expectation held
His look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d
To second, or oppose, or undertake
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each
In others count’nance red his own dismay
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime
Of those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found
So hardie as to proffer or accept
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last
_Satan_, whom now transcendent glory rais’d
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.

O Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones,
With reason hath deep silence and demurr
Seis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,
Outrageous to devour, immures us round
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant
Barr’d over us prohibit all egress.
These past, if any pass, the void profound
Of unessential Night receives him next
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being
Threatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.
If thence he scape into what ever world,
Or unknown Region, what remains him less
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,
And this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d
With splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d
And judg’d of public moment, in the shape
Of difficulty or danger could deterre
Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,
Refusing to accept as great a share
Of hazard as of honour, due alike
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due
Of hazard more, as he above the rest
High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,
Terror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,
While here shall be our home, what best may ease
The present misery, and render Hell
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize
None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose
The Monarch, and prevented all reply,
Prudent, least from his resolution rais’d
Others among the chief might offer now
(Certain to be refus’d) what erst they feard;
And so refus’d might in opinion stand
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute
Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they
Dreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;
Thir rising all at once was as the sound
Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend
With awful reverence prone; and as a God
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:
Nor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d,
That for the general safety he despis’d
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,
Or close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal.
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread
Heav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element
Scowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet
Extend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.
O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn’d
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree
Of Creatures rational, though under hope
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:
As if (which might induce us to accord)
Man had not hellish foes anow besides,
That day and night for his destruction waite.

The _Stygian_ Councel thus dissolv’d; and forth
In order came the grand infernal Peers,
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd
Alone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less
Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,
And God-like imitated State; him round
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie
By Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell
With deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim.
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers
Disband, and wandring, each his several way
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime
Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,
As at th’ Olympian Games or _Pythian_ fields;
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears
Wag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van
Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms
From either end of Heav’n the welkin burns.
Others with vast _Typhoean_ rage more fell
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.
As when _Alcides_ from _Oealia_ Crown’d
With conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore
Through pain up by the roots _Thessalian_ Pines,
And _Lichas_ from the top of _Oeta_ threw
Into th’ _Euboic_ Sea.  Others more milde,
Retreated in a silent valley, sing
With notes Angelical to many a Harp
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
Thir song was partial, but the harmony
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)
Others apart sat on a Hill retir’d,
In thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.
Of good and evil much they argu’d then,
Of happiness and final misery,
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
Fallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,
On bold adventure to discover wide
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;
Abhorred _Styx_ the flood of deadly hate,
Sad _Acheron_ of sorrow, black and deep;
_Cocytus_, nam’d of lamentation loud
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce _Phlegeton_
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,
_Lethe_ the River of Oblivion roules
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
A gulf profound as that _Serbonian_ Bog
Betwixt _Damiata_ and mount _Casius_ old,
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air
Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire.
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d,
At certain revolutions all the damn’d
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.
They ferry over this _Lethean_ Sound
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
All in one moment, and so neer the brink;
But fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt
_Medusa_ with _Gorgonian_ terror guards
The Ford, and of it self the water flies
All taste of living wight, as once it fled
The lip of _Tantalus_.  Thus roving on
In confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast
View’d first thir lamentable lot, and found
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile
They pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,
O’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,
A Universe of death, which God by curse
Created evil, for evil only good,
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
Abominable, inutterable, and worse
Then Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,
_Gorgons_ and _Hydra’s_, and _Chimera’s_ dire.

Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,
_Satan_ with thoughts inflam’d of highest design,
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight; som times
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares
Up to the fiery concave touring high.
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d
Hangs in the Clouds, by _Aequinoctial_ Winds
Close sailing from _Bengala_, or the Iles
Of _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood
Through the wide _Ethiopian_ to the Cape
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem’d
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,
Impenitrable, impal’d with circling fire,
Yet unconsum’d.  Before the Gates there sat
On either side a formidable shape;
The one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair,
But ended foul in many a scaly fould
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d
With mortal sting: about her middle round
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d
With wide _Cerberean_ mouths full loud, and rung
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,
If aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb,
And kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d
Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these
Vex’d _Scylla_ bathing in the Sea that parts
_Calabria_ from the hoarce _Trinacrian_ shore:
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d
In secret, riding through the Air she comes
Lur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance
With _Lapland_ Witches, while the labouring Moon
Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,
If shape it might be call’d that shape had none
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,
Or substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,
For each seem’d either; black it stood as Night,
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.
_Satan_ was now at hand, and from his seat
The Monster moving onward came as fast,
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.
Th’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,
Admir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except,
Created thing naught vallu’d he nor shun’d;
And with disdainful look thus first began.

Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,
That dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,
That be assur’d, without leave askt of thee:
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav’n.

To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d,
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,
Who first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then
Unbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons
Conjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou
And they outcast from God, are here condemn’d
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?
And reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,
Hell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn,
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,
Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.

So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold
More dreadful and deform: on th’ other side
Incenc’t with indignation _Satan_ stood
Unterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,
That fires the length of _Ophiucus_ huge
In th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head
Level’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands
No second stroke intend, and such a frown
Each cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds
With Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on
Over the _Caspian_, then stand front to front
Hov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;
For never but once more was either like
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
Had been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,
Ris’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.

O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,
Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son,
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart
Against thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom;
For him who sits above and laughs the while
At thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute
What e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.

She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
Forbore, then these to her _Satan_ return’d:

So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends; till first I know of thee,
What thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why
In this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st
Me Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son?
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable then him and thee.

T’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair
In Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin’d
In bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth, till on the left side op’ning wide,
Likest to thee in shape and count’nance bright,
Then shining heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis’d
All th’ Host of Heav’n; back they recoild affraid
At first, and call’d me _Sin_, and for a Sign
Portentous held me; but familiar grown,
I pleas’d, and with attractive graces won
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing
Becam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st
With me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d
A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,
And fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell
Driv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down
Into this Deep, and in the general fall
I also; at which time this powerful Key
Into my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass
Without my op’ning.  Pensive here I sat
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew
Transform’d: but he my inbred enemie
Forth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out _Death_;
Hell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d
From all her Caves, and back resounded _Death_.
I fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems,
Inflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far,
Me overtook his mother all dismaid,
And in embraces forcible and foule
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
To me, for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth
Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,
That rest or intermission none I find.
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim _Death_ my Son and foe, who sets them on,
And me his Parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey, but that he knows
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,
Though temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.

She finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.
Dear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know
I come no enemie, but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain,
Both him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d
Fell with us from on high: from them I go
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread
Th’ unfounded deep, & through the void immense
To search with wandring quest a place foretold
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now
Created vast and round, a place of bliss
In the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d,
Least Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught
Then this more secret now design’d, I haste
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.
He ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear
His famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe
Destin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.

The key of this infernal Pit by due,
And by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
These Adamantine Gates; against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,
Fearless to be o’rematcht by living might.
But what ow I to his commands above
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of _Tartarus_ profound,
To sit in hateful Office here confin’d,
Inhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born,
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,
With terrors and with clamors compasst round
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou
My being gav’st me; whom should I obey
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss, among
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.

Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,
Which but her self not all the _Stygian_ powers
Could once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns
Th’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease
Unfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound
Th’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
Of _Erebus_.  She op’nd, but to shut
Excel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood,
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark
Illimitable Ocean without bound,
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night
And _Chaos_, Ancestors of Nature, hold
Eternal _Anarchie_, amidst the noise
Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag
Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,
Light-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
Swarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands
Of _Barca_ or _Cyrene’s_ torrid soil,
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise
Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,
Hee rules a moment; _Chaos_ Umpire sits,
And by decision more imbroiles the fray
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter
_Chance_ governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt
Confus’dly, and which thus must ever fight,
Unless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more Worlds,
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while,
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith
He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal’d
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
Great things with small) then when _Bellona_ storms,
With all her battering Engines bent to rase
Som Capital City, or less then if this frame
Of Heav’n were falling, and these Elements
In mutinie had from her Axle torn
The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets
A vast vacuitie: all unawares
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft: that furie stay’d,
Quencht in a Boggie _Syrtris_, neither Sea,
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,
Pursues the _Arimaspian_, who by stelth
Had from his wakeful custody purloind
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:
At length a universal hubbub wilde
Of stunning sounds and voices all confus’d
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,
Undaunted to meet there what ever power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne
Of _Chaos_, and his dark Pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood
_Orcus_ and _Ades_, and the dreaded name
Of _Demogorgon_; Rumor next and Chance,
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.

T’ whom _Satan_ turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,
_Chaos_ and _Ancient Night_, I come no Spie,
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint
Wandring this darksome desart, as my way
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds
Confine with Heav’n; or if som other place
From your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King
Possesses lately, thither to arrive
I travel this profound, direct my course;
Directed, no mean recompence it brings
To your behoof, if I that Region lost,
All usurpation thence expell’d, reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
(Which is my present journey) and once more
Erect the Standerd there of _Ancient Night_;
Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.

Thus _Satan_; and him thus the Anarch old
With faultring speech and visage incompos’d
Answer’d.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art,
That mighty leading Angel, who of late
Made head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown.
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands
Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,
That little which is left so to defend
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World
Hung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain
To that side Heav’n from whence your Legions fell:
If that way be your walk, you have not farr;
So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.

He ceas’d; and _Satan_ staid not to reply,
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,
With fresh alacritie and force renew’d
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round
Environ’d wins his way; harder beset
And more endanger’d, then when _Argo_ pass’d
Through _Bosporus_ betwixt the justling Rocks:
Or when _Ulysses_ on the Larbord shunnd
_Charybdis_, and by th’ other whirlpool steard.
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Mov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee;
But hee once past, soon after when man fell,
Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain
Following his track, such was the will of Heav’n,
Pav’d after him a broad and beat’n way
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf
Tamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length
From Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
With easie intercourse pass to and fro
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
God and good Angels guard by special grace.
But now at last the sacred influence
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins
Her fardest verge, and _Chaos_ to retire
As from her outmost works a brok’n foe
With tumult less and with less hostile din,
That _Satan_ with less toil, and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold
Farr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide
In circuit, undetermind square or round,
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.

      THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK III.

Hail holy light, ofspring of Heav’n first-born,
Or of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam
May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
Escap’t the _Stygian_ Pool, though long detain’d
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes then to th’ _Orphean_ Lyre
I sung of _Chaos_ and _Eternal Night_,
Taught by the heav’nly Muse to venture down
The dark descent, and up to reascend,
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou
Revisit’st not these eyes, that rowle in vain
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,
Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
Thee _Sion_ and the flowrie Brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget
Those other two equal’d with me in Fate,
So were I equal’d with them in renown,
Blind _Thamyris_ and blind _Maeonides_,
And _Tiresias_ and _Phineus_ Prophets old.
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year
Seasons return, but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev’n or Morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark
Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men
Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair
Presented with a Universal blanc
Of Natures works to mee expung’d and ras’d,
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.
So much the rather thou Celestial light
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight.

Now had the Almighty Father from above,
From the pure Empyrean where he sits
High Thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye,
His own works and their works at once to view:
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv’d
Beatitude past utterance; on his right
The radiant image of his Glory sat,
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t,
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love
In blissful solitude; he then survey’d
Hell and the Gulf between, and _Satan_ there
Coasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet
On the bare outside of this World, that seem’d
Firm land imbosom’d without Firmament,
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.
Him God beholding from his prospect high,
Wherein past, present, future he beholds,
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.

Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds
Prescrib’d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems
On desperat revenge, that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head.  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not farr off Heav’n, in the Precincts of light,
Directly towards the new created World,
And Man there plac’t, with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy, or worse,
By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;
For man will heark’n to his glozing lyes,
And easily transgress the sole Command,
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee
All he could have; I made him just and right,
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
Such I created all th’ Ethereal Powers
And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild;
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,
Not what they would? what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid,
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,
Made passive both, had servd necessitie,
Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,
So were created, nor can justly accuse
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;
As if Predestination over-rul’d
Thir will, dispos’d by absolute Decree
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,
Which had no less prov’d certain unforeknown.
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so
I formd them free, and free they must remain,
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain’d
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain’d thir fall.
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,
Self-tempted, self-deprav’d: Man falls deceiv’d
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,
Through Heav’n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.

Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d
All Heav’n, and in the blessed Spirits elect
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d:
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon
Substantially express’d, and in his face
Divine compassion visibly appeerd,
Love without end, and without measure Grace,
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.

O Father, gracious was that word which clos’d
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;
For which both Heav’n and Earth shall high extoll
Thy praises, with th’ innumerable sound
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne
Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.
For should Man finally be lost, should Man
Thy creature late so lov’d, thy youngest Son
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd
With his own folly? that be from thee farr,
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge
Of all things made, and judgest onely right.
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,
Or proud return though to his heavier doom,
Yet with revenge accomplish’t and to Hell
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be questiond and blaspheam’d without defence.

To whom the great Creatour thus reply’d.
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,
All hast thou spok’n as my thoughts are, all
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will,
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall’d
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal foe,
By me upheld, that he may know how frail
His fall’n condition is, and to me ow
All his deliv’rance, and to none but me.
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
Elect above the rest; so is my will:
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes
Th’ incensed Deitie, while offerd grace
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,
What may suffice, and soft’n stonie hearts
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,
Though but endevord with sincere intent,
Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
And I will place within them as a guide
My Umpire _Conscience_, whom if they will hear,
Light after light well us’d they shall attain,
And to the end persisting, safe arrive.
This my long sufferance and my day of grace
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
But hard be hard’nd, blind be blinded more,
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;
And none but such from mercy I exclude.
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns
Against the high Supremacie of Heav’n,
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,
To expiate his Treason hath naught left,
But to destruction sacred and devote,
He with his whole posteritie must die,
Die hee or Justice must; unless for him
Som other able, and as willing, pay
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
Say Heav’nly Powers, where shall we find such love,
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem
Mans mortal crime, and just th’ unjust to save,
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?

He ask’d, but all the Heav’nly Quire stood mute,
And silence was in Heav’n: on mans behalf
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,
Much less that durst upon his own head draw
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have bin lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,
His dearest mediation thus renewd.

Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
The speediest of thy winged messengers,
To visit all thy creatures, and to all
Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought,
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;
Attonement for himself or offering meet,
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee
Freely put off, and for him lastly die
Well pleas’d, on me let Death wreck all his rage;
Under his gloomie power I shall not long
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,
Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule
For ever with corruption there to dwell;
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue
My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm’d.
I through the ample Air in Triumph high
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show
The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight
Pleas’d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,
While by thee rais’d I ruin all my Foes,
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:
Then with the multitude of my redeemd
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud
Of anger shall remain, but peace assur’d,
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more
Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.

His words here ended, but his meek aspect
Silent yet spake, and breath’d immortal love
To mortal men, above which only shon
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
Glad to be offer’d, he attends the will
Of his great Father.  Admiration seis’d
All Heav’n, what this might mean, & whither tend
Wondring; but soon th’ Almighty thus reply’d:

O thou in Heav’n and Earth the only peace
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou
My sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear,
To me are all my works, nor Man the least
Though last created, that for him I spare
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;
And be thy self Man among men on Earth,
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,
By wondrous birth: Be thou in _Adams_ room
The Head of all mankind, though _Adams_ Son.
As in him perish all men, so in thee
As from a second root shall be restor’d,
As many as are restor’d, without thee none.
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee
Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg’d and die,
And dying rise, and rising with him raise
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.
So Heav’nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate
So easily destroy’d, and still destroyes
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
Mans Nature, less’n or degrade thine owne.
Because thou hast, though Thron’d in highest bliss
Equal to God, and equally enjoying
God-like fruition, quitted all to save
A World from utter loss, and hast been found
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,
Found worthiest to be so by being Good,
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,
Anointed universal King; all Power
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;
When thou attended gloriously from Heav’n
Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes
The living, and forthwith the cited dead
Of all past Ages to the general Doom
Shall hast’n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.
Then all thy Saints assembl’d, thou shalt judge
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring
New Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell
And after all thir tribulations long
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,
For regal Scepter then no more shall need,
God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,
Adore him, who to compass all this dies,
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.

No sooner had th’ Almighty ceas’t, but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav’n rung
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna’s fill’d
Th’ eternal Regions: lowly reverent
Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence
To Heav’n remov’d where first it grew, there grows,
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn
Rowls o’re _Elisian_ Flours her Amber stream;
With these that never fade the Spirits Elect
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath’d with beams,
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon
Impurpl’d with Celestial Roses smil’d.
Then Crown’d again thir gold’n Harps they took,
Harps ever tun’d, that glittering by their side
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet
Of charming symphonie they introduce
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine
Melodious part, such concord is in Heav’n.

Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit’st
Thron’d inaccessible, but when thou shad’st
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,
Yet dazle Heav’n, that brightest Seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
In whose conspicuous count’nance, without cloud
Made visible, th’ Almighty Father shines,
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,
Transfus’d on thee his ample Spirit rests.
Hee Heav’n of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created, and by thee threw down
Th’ aspiring Dominations: thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
Heav’ns everlasting Frame, while o’re the necks
Thou drov’st of warring Angels disarraid.
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime
Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall’n,
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son
Perceive thee purpos’d not to doom frail Man
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin’d,
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife
Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern’d,
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat
Second to thee, offerd himself to die
For mans offence.  O unexampl’d love,
Love no where to be found less then Divine!
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
Shall be the copious matter of my Song
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.

Thus they in Heav’n, above the starry Sphear,
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
Of this round World, whose first convex divides
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos’d
From _Chaos_ and th’ inroad of Darkness old,
_Satan_ alighted walks: a Globe farr off
It seem’d, now seems a boundless Continent
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
Starless expos’d, and ever-threatning storms
Of _Chaos_ blustring round, inclement skie;
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav’n
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:
Here walk’d the Fiend at large in spacious field.
As when a Vultur on _Imaus_ bred,
Whose snowie ridge the roving _Tartar_ bounds,
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
Of _Ganges_ or _Hydaspes, Indian_ streams;
But in his way lights on the barren plaines
Of _Sericana_, where _Chineses_ drive
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend
Walk’d up and down alone bent on his prey,
Alone, for other Creature in this place
Living or liveless to be found was none,
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin
With vanity had filld the works of men:
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,
Or happiness in this or th’ other life;
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;
All th’ unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,
Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
Till final dissolution, wander here,
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt th’ Angelical and Human kinde:
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
First from the ancient World those Giants came
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:
The builders next of _Babel_ on the Plain
Of _Sennaar_, and still with vain designe
New _Babels_, had they wherewithall, would build:
Others came single; hee who to be deemd
A God, leap’d fondly into _Aetna_ flames,
_Empedocles_, and hee who to enjoy
_Plato’s Elysium_, leap’d into the Sea,
_Cleombrotus_, and many more too long,
Embryo’s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray’d so farr to seek
In _Golgotha_ him dead, who lives in Heav’n;
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of _Dominic_,
Or in _Franciscan_ think to pass disguis’d;
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov’d;
And now Saint _Peter_ at Heav’ns Wicket seems
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
Of Heav’ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe
A violent cross wind from either Coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
Into the devious Air; then might ye see
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft
Fly o’re the backside of the World farr off
Into a _Limbo_ large and broad, since calld
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
Long after, now unpeopl’d, and untrod;
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass’d,
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste
His travell’d steps; farr distant hee descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
The Stairs were such as whereon _Jacob_ saw
Angels ascending and descending, bands
Of Guardians bright, when he from _Esau_ fled
To _Padan-Aram_ in the field of _Luz_,
Dreaming by night under the open Skie,
And waking cri’d, This is the Gate of Heav’n.
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav’n somtimes
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow’d
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon
Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv’d,
Wafted by Angels, or flew o’re the Lake
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.
Direct against which op’nd from beneath,
Just o’re the blissful seat of Paradise,
A passage down to th’ Earth, a passage wide,
Wider by farr then that of after-times
Over Mount _Sion_, and, though that were large,
Over the _Promis’d Land_ to God so dear,
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
On high behests his Angels to and fro
Pass’d frequent, and his eye with choice regard
From _Paneas_ the fount of _Jordans_ flood
To _Beersaba_, where the _Holy Land_
Borders on _Aegypt_ and the _Arabian_ shoare;
So wide the op’ning seemd, where bounds were set
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.
_Satan_ from hence now on the lower stair
That scal’d by steps of Gold to Heav’n Gate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some forein land
First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.
Such wonder seis’d, though after Heaven seen,
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis’d
At sight of all this World beheld so faire.
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood
So high above the circling Canopie
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point
Of _Libra_ to the fleecie Starr that bears
_Andromeda_ farr off _Atlantick_ Seas
Beyond th’ _Horizon_; then from Pole to Pole
He views in bredth, and without longer pause
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,
Like those _Hesperian_ Gardens fam’d of old,
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there
He stayd not to enquire: above them all
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven
Allur’d his eye: Thither his course he bends
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute
Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp
Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms
The Univers, and to each inward part
With gentle penetration, though unseen,
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:
So wondrously was set his Station bright.
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the Sun’s lucent Orbe
Through his glaz’d Optic Tube yet never saw.
The place he found beyond expression bright,
Compar’d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;
Not all parts like, but all alike informd
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon
In _Aarons_ Brest-plate, and a stone besides
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,
That stone, or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde
Volatil _Hermes_, and call up unbound
In various shapes old _Proteus_ from the Sea,
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth _Elixir_ pure, and Rivers run
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch
Th’ Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazl’d, farr and wide his eye commands,
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon
Culminate from th’ _Aequator_, as they now
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,
No where so cleer, sharp’nd his visual ray
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,
The same whom _John_ saw also in the Sun:
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar
Circl’d his Head, nor less his Locks behind
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy’d
Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandring flight
To Paradise the happie seat of Man,
His journies end and our beginning woe.
But first he casts to change his proper shape,
Which else might work him danger or delay:
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
Youth smil’d Celestial, and to every Limb
Sutable grace diffus’d, so well he feignd;
Under a Coronet his flowing haire
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl’d with Gold,
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,
Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known
Th’ Arch-Angel _Uriel_, one of the seav’n
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes
That run through all the Heav’ns, or down to th’ Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
O’re Sea and Land: him _Satan_ thus accostes;

_Uriel_, for thou of those seav’n Spirits that stand
In sight of God’s high Throne, gloriously bright,
The first art wont his great authentic will
Interpreter through highest Heav’n to bring,
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;
And here art likeliest by supream decree
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye
To visit oft this new Creation round;
Unspeakable desire to see, and know
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,
His chief delight and favour, him for whom
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim
Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;
That I may find him, and with secret gaze,
Or open admiration him behold
On whom the great Creator hath bestowd
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;
That both in him and all things, as is meet,
The Universal Maker we may praise;
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss
Created this new happie Race of Men
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.

So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks
Invisible, except to God alone,
By his permissive will, through Heav’n and Earth:
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil’d
_Uriel_, though Regent of the Sun, and held
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav’n;
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule
In his uprightness answer thus returnd.
Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know
The works of God, thereby to glorifie
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
Contented with report heare onely in heav’n:
For wonderful indeed are all his works,
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;
But what created mind can comprehend
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,
This worlds material mould, came to a heap:
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar
Stood rul’d, stood vast infinitude confin’d;
Till at his second bidding darkness fled,
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav’n
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;
Each had his place appointed, each his course,
The rest in circuit walles this Universe.
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light
His day, which else as th’ other Hemisphere
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide
Timely interposes, and her monthly round
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav’n;
With borrowd light her countenance triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th’ Earth,
And in her pale dominion checks the night.
That spot to which I point is _Paradise_,
_Adams_ abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.

Thus said, he turnd, and _Satan_ bowing low,
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,
Down from th’ Ecliptic, sped with hop’d success,
Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,
Nor staid, till on _Niphates_ top he lights.

       THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK IV.

O For that warning voice, which he who saw
Th’ _Apocalyps_, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
Came furious down to be reveng’d on men,
_Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth!_ that now,
While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap’d
Haply so scap’d his mortal snare; for now
_Satan_, now first inflam’d with rage, came down,
The Tempter ere th’ Accuser of man-kind,
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract
His troubl’d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr
The Hell within him, for within him Hell
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell
One step no more then from himself can fly
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie
Of what he was, what is, and what must be
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
Sometimes towards _Eden_ which now in his view
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,
Sometimes towards Heav’n and the full-blazing Sun,
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.

O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,
Look’st from thy sole Dominion like the God
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams
That bring to my remembrance from what state
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down
Warring in Heav’n against Heav’ns matchless King:
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return
From me, whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence, and with his good
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
What could be less then to afford him praise,
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,
How due! yet all his good prov’d ill in me,
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
The debt immense of endless gratitude,
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;
Forgetful what from him I still receivd,
And understood not that a grateful mind
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais’d
Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power
As great might have aspir’d, and me though mean
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great
Fell not, but stand unshak’n, from within
Or from without, to all temptations arm’d.
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,
But Heav’ns free Love dealt equally to all?
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,
To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
Nay curs’d be thou; since against his thy will
Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
Me miserable! which way shall I flie
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threatning to devour me opens wide,
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav’n.
O then at last relent: is there no place
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?
None left but by submission; and that word
_Disdain_ forbids me, and my dread of shame
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc’d
With other promises and other vaunts
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue
Th’ Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,
Under what torments inwardly I groane;
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc’d
The lower still I fall, onely Supream
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.
But say I could repent and could obtaine
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay
What feign’d submission swore: ease would recant
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc’d so deep:
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare
Short intermission bought with double smart.
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr
From granting hee, as I from begging peace:
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead
Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,
Mankind created, and for him this World.
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least
Divided Empire with Heav’ns King I hold
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.

Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face
Thrice chang’d with pale, ire, envie and despair,
Which marrd his borrow’d visage, and betraid
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.
For heav’nly mindes from such distempers foule
Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware,
Each perturbation smooth’d with outward calme,
Artificer of fraud; and was the first
That practisd falshood under saintly shew,
Deep malice to conceale, couch’t with revenge:
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive
_Uriel_ once warnd; whose eye pursu’d him down
The way he went, and on th’ _Assyrian_ mount
Saw him disfigur’d, more then could befall
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,
As he suppos’d, all unobserv’d, unseen.
So on he fares, and to the border comes
Of _Eden_, where delicious Paradise,
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,
As with a rural mound the champain head
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,
Access deni’d; and over head up grew
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre
Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops
The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.
And higher then that Wall a circling row
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:
On which the Sun more glad impress’d his beams
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile
Beyond the _Cape of Hope_, and now are past
_Mozambic_, off at Sea North-East windes blow
_Sabean_ Odours from the spicie shoare
Of _Arabie_ the blest, with such delay
Well pleas’d they slack thir course, and many a League
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas’d
Then _Asmodeus_ with the fishie fume,
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse
Of _Tobits_ Son, and with a vengeance sent
From _Media_ post to _Aegypt_, there fast bound.

Now to th’ ascent of that steep savage Hill
_Satan_ had journied on, pensive and slow;
But further way found none, so thick entwin’d,
As one continu’d brake, the undergrowth
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext
All path of Man or Beast that past that way:
One Gate there onely was, and that look’d East
On th’ other side: which when th’ arch-fellon saw
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,
At one slight bound high overleap’d all bound
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within
Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe,
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve
In hurdl’d Cotes amid the field secure,
Leaps o’re the fence with ease into the Fould:
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,
In at the window climbes, or o’re the tiles;
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,
The middle Tree and highest there that grew,
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death
To them who liv’d; nor on the vertue thought
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us’d
For prospect, what well us’d had bin the pledge
Of immortalitie.  So little knows
Any, but God alone, to value right
The good before him, but perverts best things
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.
Beneath him with new wonder now he views
To all delight of human sense expos’d
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East
Of _Eden_ planted; _Eden_ stretchd her Line
From _Auran_ Eastward to the Royal Towrs
Of great _Seleucia_, built by _Grecian_ Kings,
Or where the Sons of _Eden_ long before
Dwelt in _Telassar:_ in this pleasant soile
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;
Out of the fertil ground he caus’d to grow
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life
Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.
Southward through _Eden_ went a River large,
Nor chang’d his course, but through the shaggie hill
Pass’d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais’d
Upon the rapid current, which through veins
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,
Which from his darksom passage now appeers,
And now divided into four main Streams,
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme
And Country whereof here needs no account,
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,
With mazie error under pendant shades
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote
The open field, and where the unpierc’t shade
Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,
A happy rural seat of various view;
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde
Hung amiable, _Hesperian_ Fables true,
If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos’d,
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap
Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves
Of coole recess, o’re which the mantling Vine
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,
Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
The trembling leaves, while Universal _Pan_
Knit with the _Graces_ and the _Hours_ in dance
Led on th’ Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field
Of _Enna_, where _Proserpin_ gathring flours
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie _Dis_
Was gatherd, which cost _Ceres_ all that pain
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove
Of _Daphne_ by _Orontes_, and th’ inspir’d
_Castalian_ Spring might with this Paradise
Of _Eden_ strive; nor that _Nyseian_ Ile
Girt with the River _Triton_, where old _Cham_,
Whom Gentiles _Ammon_ call and _Libyan Jove_,
Hid _Amalthea_ and her Florid Son
Young _Bacchus_ from his Stepdame _Rhea’s_ eye;
Nor where _Abassin_ Kings thir issue Guard,
Mount _Amara_, though this by som suppos’d
True Paradise under the _Ethiop_ Line
By _Nilus_ head, enclos’d with shining Rock,
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote
From this _Assyrian_ Garden, where the Fiend
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine
The image of thir glorious Maker shon,
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,
Severe, but in true filial freedom plac’t;
Whence true autoritie in men; though both
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;
For contemplation hee and valour formd,
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,
Hee for God only, shee for God in him:
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar’d
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks
Round from his parted forelock manly hung
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste
Her unadorned golden tresses wore
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav’d
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli’d
Subjection, but requir’d with gentle sway,
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,
And sweet reluctant amorous delay.
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl’d all mankind
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,
And banisht from mans life his happiest life,
Simplicitie and spotless innocence.
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair
That ever since in loves imbraces met,
_Adam_ the goodliest man of men since borne
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters _Eve_.
Under a tuft of shade that on a green
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side
They sat them down, and after no more toil
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic’d
To recommend coole _Zephyr_, and made ease
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,
Alone as they.  About them frisking playd
All Beasts of th’ Earth, since wilde, and of all chase
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw
Dandl’d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards
Gambold before them, th’ unwieldy Elephant
To make them mirth us’d all his might, & wreathd
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun
Declin’d was hasting now with prone carreer
To th’ Ocean Iles, and in th’ ascending Scale
Of Heav’n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:
When _Satan_ still in gaze, as first he stood,
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.

O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc’t
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,
Not Spirits, yet to heav’nly Spirits bright
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh
Your change approaches, when all these delights
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;
Happie, but for so happie ill secur’d
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav’n
Ill fenc’t for Heav’n to keep out such a foe
As now is enterd; yet no purpos’d foe
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,
And mutual amitie so streight, so close,
That I with you must dwell, or you with me
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,
To entertain you two, her widest Gates,
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,
Not like these narrow limits, to receive
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.
And should I at your harmless innocence
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg’d,
By conquering this new World, compels me now
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.

So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,
The Tyrants plea, excus’d his devilish deeds.
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree
Down he alights among the sportful Herd
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi’d
To mark what of thir state he more might learn
By word or action markt: about them round
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi’d
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both
Grip’t in each paw: when _Adam_ first of men
To first of women _Eve_ thus moving speech,
Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.

Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power
That made us, and for us this ample World
Be infinitly good, and of his good
As liberal and free as infinite,
That rais’d us from the dust and plac’t us here
In all this happiness, who at his hand
Have nothing merited, nor can performe
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires
From us no other service then to keep
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees
In Paradise that beare delicious fruit
So various, not to taste that onely Tree
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst
God hath pronounc’t it death to taste that Tree,
The only sign of our obedience left
Among so many signes of power and rule
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv’n
Over all other Creatures that possesse
Earth, Aire, and Sea.  Then let us not think hard
One easie prohibition, who enjoy
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice
Unlimited of manifold delights:
But let us ever praise him, and extoll
His bountie, following our delightful task
To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours,
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.

To whom thus Eve repli’d.  O thou for whom
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,
And without whom am to no end, my Guide
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.
For wee to him indeed all praises owe,
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee
Preeminent by so much odds, while thou
Like consort to thy self canst no where find.
That day I oft remember, when from sleep
I first awak’t, and found my self repos’d
Under a shade on flours, much wondring where
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
Of waters issu’d from a Cave and spread
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov’d
Pure as th’ expanse of Heav’n; I thither went
With unexperienc’t thought, and laid me downe
On the green bank, to look into the cleer
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.
As I bent down to look, just opposite,
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd
Bending to look on me, I started back,
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,
Pleas’d it returnd as soon with answering looks
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt
Mine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desire,
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,
With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call’d
Mother of human Race: what could I doe,
But follow strait, invisibly thus led?
Till I espi’d thee, fair indeed and tall,
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,
Thou following cryd’st aloud, Return fair _Eve_,
Whom fli’st thou? whom thou fli’st, of him thou art,
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side
Henceforth an individual solace dear;
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim
My other half: with that thy gentle hand
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see
How beauty is excelld by manly grace
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.

So spake our general Mother, and with eyes
Of conjugal attraction unreprov’d,
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast
Naked met his under the flowing Gold
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms
Smil’d with superior Love, as _Jupiter_
On _Juno_ smiles, when he impregns the Clouds
That shed _May_ Flowers; and press’d her Matron lip
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne
Ey’d them askance, and to himself thus plaind.

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two
Imparadis’t in one anothers arms
The happier _Eden_, shall enjoy thir fill
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
Among our other torments not the least,
Still unfulfill’d with pain of longing pines;
Yet let me not forget what I have gain’d
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call’d,
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd’n?
Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord
Envie them that? can it be sin to know,
Can it be death? and do they onely stand
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build
Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds
With more desire to know, and to reject
Envious commands, invented with designe
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?
But first with narrow search I must walk round
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi’d;
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
Some wandring Spirit of Heav’n, by Fountain side,
Or in thick shade retir’d, from him to draw
What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.

So saying, his proud step he scornful turn’d,
But with sly circumspection, and began
Through wood, through waste, o’re hil, o’re dale his roam.
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav’n
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun
Slowly descended, and with right aspect
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock
Of Alablaster, pil’d up to the Clouds,
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.
Betwixt these rockie Pillars _Gabriel_ sat
Chief of th’ Angelic Guards, awaiting night;
About him exercis’d Heroic Games
Th’ unarmed Youth of Heav’n, but nigh at hand
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.
Thither came _Uriel_, gliding through the Eeven
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr
In _Autumn_ thwarts the night, when vapors fir’d
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner
From what point of his Compass to beware
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.

_Gabriel_, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv’n
Charge and strict watch that to this happie place
No evil thing approach or enter in;
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare
A Spirit, zealous, as he seem’d, to know
More of th’ Almighties works, and chiefly Man
Gods latest Image: I describ’d his way
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;
But in the Mount that lies from _Eden_ North,
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks
Alien from Heav’n, with passions foul obscur’d:
Mine eye pursu’d him still, but under shade
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew
I fear, hath ventur’d from the deep, to raise
New troubles; him thy care must be to find.

To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:
_Uriel_, no wonder if thy perfet sight,
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,
See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass
The vigilance here plac’t, but such as come
Well known from Heav’n; and since Meridian hour
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.
But if within the circuit of these walks
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.

So promis’d hee, and _Uriel_ to his charge
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall’n
Beneath th’ _Azores_; whither the prime Orb,
Incredible how swift, had thither rowl’d
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth
By shorter flight to th’ East, had left him there
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
Silence was pleas’d: now glow’d the Firmament
With living Saphirs: _Hesperus_ that led
The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon
Rising in clouded Majestie, at length
Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,
And o’re the dark her Silver Mantle threw.

When _Adam_ thus to _Eve_: Fair Consort, th’ hour
Of night, and all things now retir’d to rest
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set
Labour and rest, as day and night to men
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;
Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,
And the regard of Heav’n on all his waies;
While other Animals unactive range,
And of thir doings God takes no account.
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East
With first approach of light, we must be ris’n,
And at our pleasant labour, to reform
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,
That mock our scant manuring, and require
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.

To whom thus _Eve_ with perfet beauty adornd.
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst
Unargu’d I obey; so God ordains,
God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.
With thee conversing I forget all time,
All seasons and thir change, all please alike.
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun
When first on this delightful Land he spreads
His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,
And these the Gemms of Heav’n, her starrie train:
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,
Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?

To whom our general Ancestor repli’d.
Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht _Eve_,
Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,
By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land
In order, though to Nations yet unborn,
Ministring light prepar’d, they set and rise;
Least total darkness should by Night regaine
Her old possession, and extinguish life
In Nature and all things, which these soft fires
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate
Of various influence foment and warme,
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down
Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow
On Earth, made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.
These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,
That heav’n would want spectators, God want praise;
Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:
All these with ceasless praise his works behold
Both day and night: how often from the steep
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air,
Sole, or responsive each to others note
Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk
With Heav’nly touch of instrumental sounds
In full harmonic number joind, thir songs
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.

Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass’d
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place
Chos’n by the sovran Planter, when he fram’d
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
_Acanthus_, and each odorous bushie shrub
Fenc’d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,
_Iris_ all hues, Roses, and Gessamin
Rear’d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay
Broiderd the ground, more colour’d then with stone
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;
Such was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,
_Pan_ or _Silvanus_ never slept, nor Nymph,
Nor _Faunus_ haunted.  Here in close recess
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs
Espoused _Eve_ deckt first her Nuptial Bed,
And heav’nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,
What day the genial Angel to our Sire
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn’d,
More lovely then _Pandora_, whom the Gods
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son
Of _Japhet_ brought by _Hermes_, she ensnar’d
Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng’d
On him who had stole _Joves_ authentic fire.

Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv’d, both stood,
Both turnd, and under op’n Skie ador’d
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav’n
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe
And starrie Pole: Thou also mad’st the Night,
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,
Which we in our appointed work imployd
Have finisht happie in our mutual help
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss
Ordain’d by thee, and this delicious place
For us too large, where thy abundance wants
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
But thou hast promis’d from us two a Race
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.

This said unanimous, and other Rites
Observing none, but adoration pure
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower
Handed they went; and eas’d the putting off
These troublesom disguises which wee wear,
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene
_Adam_ from his fair Spouse, nor _Eve_ the Rites
Mysterious of connubial Love refus’d:
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk
Of puritie and place and innocence,
Defaming as impure what God declares
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie,
In Paradise of all things common else.
By thee adulterous lust was driv’n from men
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee
Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,
Relations dear, and all the Charities
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,
Whose Bed is undefil’d and chast pronounc’t,
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us’d.
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,
Or Serenate, which the starv’d Lover sings
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair’d.  Sleep on,
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek
No happier state, and know to know no more.

Now had night measur’d with her shaddowie Cone
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim
Forth issuing at th’ accustomd hour stood armd
To thir night watches in warlike Parade,
When _Gabriel_ to his next in power thus spake.

_Uzziel_, half these draw off, and coast the South
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,
Our circuit meets full West.  As flame they part
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.

_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_, with wingd speed
Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook,
But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.
This Eevning from the Sun’s decline arriv’d
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap’d
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.

So saying, on he led his radiant Files,
Daz’ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct
In search of whom they sought: him there they found
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of _Eve_;
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
Th’ animal Spirits that from pure blood arise
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.
Him thus intent _Ithuriel_ with his Spear
Touch’d lightly; for no falshood can endure
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts
Discoverd and surpriz’d.  As when a spark
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine
With sudden blaze diffus’d, inflames the Aire:
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz’d
So sudden to behold the grieslie King;
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.

Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg’d to Hell
Com’st thou, escap’d thy prison, and transform’d,
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?

Know ye not then said _Satan_, filld with scorn,
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
Your message, like to end as much in vain?
To whom thus _Zephon_, answering scorn with scorn.
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known
As when thou stoodst in Heav’n upright and pure;
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,
Departed from thee, and thou resembl’st now
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
This place inviolable, and these from harm.

So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin’d
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd
His lustre visibly impar’d; yet seemd
Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,
Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said _Zephon_ bold,
Will save us trial what the least can doe
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.

The Fiend repli’d not, overcome with rage;
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie
He held it vain; awe from above had quelld
His heart, not else dismai’d.  Now drew they nigh
The western point, where those half-rounding guards
Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind
Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief
_Gabriel_ from the Front thus calld aloud.

O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne
_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_ through the shade,
And with them comes a third of Regal port,
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,
Not likely to part hence without contest;
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.

He scarce had ended, when those two approachd
And brief related whom they brought, wher found,
How busied, in what form and posture coucht.

To whom with stern regard thus _Gabriel_ spake.
Why hast thou, _Satan_, broke the bounds prescrib’d
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge
Of others, who approve not to transgress
By thy example, but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place;
Imploi’d it seems to violate sleep, and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?

To whom thus _Satan_ with contemptuous brow.
_Gabriel_, thou hadst in Heav’n th’ esteem of wise,
And such I held thee; but this question askt
Puts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,
Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,
And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change
Torment with ease, & soonest recompence
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
To thee no reason; who knowst only good,
But evil hast not tri’d: and wilt object
His will who bound us? let him surer barr
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.
The rest is true, they found me where they say;
But that implies not violence or harme.

Thus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov’d,
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli’d.
O loss of one in Heav’n to judge of wise,
Since _Satan_ fell, whom follie overthrew,
And now returns him from his prison scap’t,
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicenc’t from his bounds in Hell prescrib’d;
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However, and to scape his punishment.
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,
Which thou incurr’st by flying, meet thy flight
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provok’t.
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,
The first in flight from pain, had’st thou alleg’d
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.

To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide
The blasting volied Thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.
But still thy words at random, as before,
Argue thy inexperience what behooves
From hard assaies and ill successes past
A faithful Leader, not to hazard all
Through wayes of danger by himself untri’d.
I therefore, I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie
This new created World, whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;
Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord
High up in Heav’n, with songs to hymne his Throne,
And practis’d distances to cringe, not fight.

To whom the warriour Angel soon repli’d.
To say and strait unsay, pretending first
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,
Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac’t,
_Satan_, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,
O sacred name of faithfulness profan’d!
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;
Was this your discipline and faith ingag’d,
Your military obedience, to dissolve
Allegeance to th’ acknowledg’d Power supream?
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty, who more then thou
Once fawn’d, and cring’d, and servilly ador’d
Heav’ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,
Back to th’ infernal pit I drag thee chaind,
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.

So threatn’d hee, but _Satan_ to no threats
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli’d.

Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,
Us’d to the yoak, draw’st his triumphant wheels
In progress through the rode of Heav’n Star-pav’d.

While thus he spake, th’ Angelic Squadron bright
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field
Of _Ceres_ ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
Prove chaff.  On th’ other side _Satan_ allarm’d
Collecting all his might dilated stood,
Like _Teneriff_ or _Atlas_ unremov’d:
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest
Sat horror Plum’d; nor wanted in his graspe
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds
Might have ensu’d, nor onely Paradise
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope
Of Heav’n perhaps, or all the Elements
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne
With violence of this conflict, had not soon
Th’ Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
Hung forth in Heav’n his golden Scales, yet seen
Betwixt _Astrea_ and the _Scorpion_ signe,
Wherein all things created first he weighd,
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc’t Aire
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights
The sequel each of parting and of fight;
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;
Which _Gabriel_ spying, thus bespake the Fiend.

_Satan_, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,
Neither our own but giv’n; what follie then
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more
Then Heav’n permits, nor mine, though doubld now
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign
Where thou art weigh’d, & shown how light, how weak,
If thou resist.  The Fiend lookt up and knew
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

       THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK V.

Now Morn her rosie steps in th’ Eastern Clime
Advancing, sow’d the Earth with Orient Pearle,
When _Adam_ wak’t, so customd, for his sleep
Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,
And temperat vapors bland, which th’ only sound
Of leaves and fuming rills, _Aurora’s_ fan,
Lightly dispers’d, and the shrill Matin Song
Of Birds on every bough; so much the more
His wonder was to find unwak’nd _Eve_
With Tresses discompos’d, and glowing Cheek,
As through unquiet rest: he on his side
Leaning half-rais’d, with looks of cordial Love
Hung over her enamour’d, and beheld
Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,
Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice
Milde, as when _Zephyrus_ on _Flora_ breathes,
Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake
My fairest, my espous’d, my latest found,
Heav’ns last best gift, my ever new delight,
Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field
Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring
Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,
What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed,
How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee
Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.

Such whispering wak’d her, but with startl’d eye
On _Adam_, whom imbracing, thus she spake.

O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see
Thy face, and Morn return’d, for I this Night,
Such night till this I never pass’d, have dream’d,
If dream’d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,
Works of day pass’t, or morrows next designe,
But of offence and trouble, which my mind
Knew never till this irksom night; methought
Close at mine ear one call’d me forth to walk
With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,
Why sleepst thou _Eve_? now is the pleasant time,
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake
Tunes sweetest his love-labor’d song; now reignes
Full Orb’d the Moon, and with more pleasing light
Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,
If none regard; Heav’n wakes with all his eyes,
Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;
To find thee I directed then my walk;
And on, methought, alone I pass’d through ways
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree
Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem’d,
Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:
And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood
One shap’d & wing’d like one of those from Heav’n
By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill’d
Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz’d;
And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg’d,
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,
Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis’d?
Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?
This said he paus’d not, but with ventrous Arme
He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil’d
At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:
But he thus overjoy’d, O Fruit Divine,
Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,
Forbidd’n here, it seems, as onely fit
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:
And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more
Communicated, more abundant growes,
The Author not impair’d, but honourd more?
Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic _Eve_,
Partake thou also; happie though thou art,
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods
Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,
But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes
Ascend to Heav’n, by merit thine, and see
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell
So quick’nd appetite, that I, methought,
Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds
With him I flew, and underneath beheld
The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide
And various: wondring at my flight and change
To this high exaltation; suddenly
My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,
And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak’d
To find this but a dream!  Thus _Eve_ her Night
Related, and thus _Adam_ answerd sad.

Best Image of my self and dearer half,
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
Affects me equally; nor can I like
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,
Created pure.  But know that in the Soule
Are many lesser Faculties that serve
Reason as chief; among these Fansie next
Her office holds; of all external things,
Which the five watchful Senses represent,
She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,
Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames
All what we affirm or what deny, and call
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
Into her private Cell when Nature rests.
Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes
To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,
Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
Som such resemblances methinks I find
Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,
But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
Evil into the mind of God or Man
May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope
That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,
Waking thou never wilt consent to do.
Be not disheart’nd then, nor cloud those looks
That wont to be more chearful and serene
Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,
And let us to our fresh imployments rise
Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours
That open now thir choicest bosom’d smells
Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.

So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,
But silently a gentle tear let fall
From either eye, and wip’d them with her haire;
Two other precious drops that ready stood,
Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell
Kiss’d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe, that feard to have offended.

So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.
But first from under shadie arborous roof,
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen
With wheels yet hov’ring o’re the Ocean brim,
Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,
Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East
Of Paradise and _Edens_ happie Plains,
Lowly they bow’d adoring, and began
Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid
In various style, for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc’t or sung
Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence
Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,
More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp
To add more sweetness, and they thus began.

These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
Almightie, thine this universal Frame,
Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!
Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens
To us invisible or dimly seen
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare
Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:
Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,
Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs
And choral symphonies, Day without Night,
Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav’n,
On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,
If better thou belong not to the dawn,
Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn
With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare
While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.
Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,
Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise
In thy eternal course, both when thou climb’st,
And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst.
Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli’st
With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,
And yee five other wandring Fires that move
In mystic Dance not without Song, resound
His praise, who out of Darkness call’d up Light.
Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth
Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run
Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix
And nourish all things, let your ceasless change
Varie to our great Maker still new praise.
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,
Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,
In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,
Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,
Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,
Rising or falling still advance his praise.
His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,
Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,
With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.
Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,
That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;
Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk
The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,
To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade
Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.
Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still
To give us onely good; and if the night
Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.

So pray’d they innocent, and to thir thoughts
Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.
On to thir mornings rural work they haste
Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row
Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr
Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check
Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine
To wed her Elm; she spous’d about him twines
Her mariageable arms, and with her brings
Her dowr th’ adopted Clusters, to adorn
His barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld
With pittie Heav’ns high King, and to him call’d
_Raphael_, the sociable Spirit, that deign’d
To travel with _Tobias_, and secur’d
His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.

_Raphael_, said hee, thou hear’st what stir on Earth
_Satan_ from Hell scap’t through the darksom Gulf
Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd
This night the human pair, how he designes
In them at once to ruin all mankind.
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend
Converse with _Adam_, in what Bowre or shade
Thou find’st him from the heat of Noon retir’d,
To respit his day-labour with repast,
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,
As may advise him of his happie state,
Happiness in his power left free to will,
Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,
Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware
He swerve not too secure: tell him withall
His danger, and from whom, what enemie
Late falln himself from Heav’n, is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss;
By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,
But by deceit and lies; this let him know,
Least wilfully transgressing he pretend
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.

So spake th’ Eternal Father, and fulfilld
All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint
After his charge receivd, but from among
Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood
Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light
Flew through the midst of Heav’n; th’ angelic Quires
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
Through all th’ Empyreal road; till at the Gate
Of Heav’n arriv’d, the gate self-opend wide
On golden Hinges turning, as by work
Divine the sov’ran Architect had fram’d.
From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
Starr interpos’d, however small he sees,
Not unconform to other shining Globes,
Earth and the Gard’n of God, with Cedars crownd
Above all Hills.  As when by night the Glass
Of _Galileo_, less assur’d, observes
Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:
Or Pilot from amidst the _Cyclades_
_Delos_ or _Samos_ first appeering kenns
A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight
He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie
Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing
Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann
Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare
Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems
A _Phoenix_, gaz’d by all, as that sole Bird
When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun’s
Bright Temple, to _Aegyptian Theb’s_ he flies.
At once on th’ Eastern cliff of Paradise
He lights, and to his proper shape returns
A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade
His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o’re his brest
With regal Ornament; the middle pair
Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round
Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold
And colours dipt in Heav’n; the third his feet
Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile
Skie-tinctur’d grain.  Like _Maia’s_ son he stood,
And shook his Plumes, that Heav’nly fragrance filld
The circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands
Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
And to his message high in honour rise;
For on som message high they guessd him bound.
Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,
And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will
Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.
Him through the spicie Forrest onward com
_Adam_ discernd, as in the dore he sat
Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun
Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme
Earths inmost womb, more warmth then _Adam_ need;
And _Eve_ within, due at her hour prepar’d
For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,
Berrie or Grape: to whom thus _Adam_ call’d.

Haste hither _Eve_, and worth thy sight behold
Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape
Comes this way moving; seems another Morn
Ris’n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav’n
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe
This day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed,
And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure
Abundance, fit to honour and receive
Our Heav’nly stranger; well we may afford
Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies
Her fertil growth, and by disburd’ning grows
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.

To whom thus _Eve_. _Adam_, earths hallowd mould,
Of God inspir’d, small store will serve, where store,
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:
But I will haste and from each bough and break,
Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice
To entertain our Angel guest, as hee
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth
God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav’n.

So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
What choice to chuse for delicacie best,
What order, so contriv’d as not to mix
Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds
In _India_ East or West, or middle shoare
In _Pontus_ or the _Punic_ Coast, or where
_Alcinous_ reign’d, fruit of all kindes, in coate,
Rough, or smooth rin’d, or bearded husk, or shell
She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape
She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes
From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest
She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold
Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground
With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum’d.
Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet
His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train
Accompani’d then with his own compleat
Perfections, in himself was all his state,
More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits
On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long
Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold
Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.
Neerer his presence _Adam_ though not awd,
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,
As to a superior Nature, bowing low,

Thus said.  Native of Heav’n, for other place
None can then Heav’n such glorious shape contain;
Since by descending from the Thrones above,
Those happie places thou hast deignd a while
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us
Two onely, who yet by sov’ran gift possess
This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat
Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.

Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.
_Adam_, I therefore came, nor art thou such
Created, or such place hast here to dwell,
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav’n
To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre
Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise
I have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge
They came, that like _Pomona’s_ Arbour smil’d
With flourets deck’t and fragrant smells; but _Eve_
Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair
Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign’d
Of three that in Mount _Ida_ naked strove,
Stood to entertain her guest from Heav’n; no vaile
Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme
Alterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel _Haile_
Bestowd, the holy salutation us’d
Long after to blest _Marie_, second _Eve_.

Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb
Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons
Then with these various fruits the Trees of God
Have heap’d this Table.  Rais’d of grassie terf
Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,
And on her ample Square from side to side
All _Autumn_ pil’d, though _Spring_ and _Autumn_ here
Danc’d hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;
No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began
Our Authour.  Heav’nly stranger, please to taste
These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom
All perfet good unmeasur’d out, descends,
To us for food and for delight hath caus’d
The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps
To spiritual Natures; only this I know,
That one Celestial Father gives to all.

To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives
(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure
Intelligential substances require
As doth your Rational; and both contain
Within them every lower facultie
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
For know, whatever was created, needs
To be sustaind and fed; of Elements
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,
Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires
Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg’d
Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale
From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.
The Sun that light imparts to all, receives
From all his alimental recompence
In humid exhalations, and at Even
Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav’n the Trees
Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines
Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn
We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground
Cover’d with pearly grain: yet God hath here
Varied his bounty so with new delights,
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,
And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate
To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn
Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold
As from the Mine.  Mean while at Table _Eve_
Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups
With pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin
Enamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts
Love unlibidinous reign’d, nor jealousie
Was understood, the injur’d Lovers Hell.

Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic’d,
Not burd’nd Nature, sudden mind arose
In _Adam_, not to let th’ occasion pass
Given him by this great Conference to know
Of things above his World, and of thir being
Who dwell in Heav’n, whose excellence he saw
Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms
Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far
Exceeded human, and his wary speech
Thus to th’ Empyreal Minister he fram’d.

Inhabitant with God, now know I well
Thy favour, in this honour done to man,
Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf’t
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
At Heav’ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?

 To whom the winged Hierarch repli’d.
O _Adam_, one Almightie is, from whom
All things proceed, and up to him return,
If not deprav’d from good, created all
Such to perfection, one first matter all,
Indu’d with various forms, various degrees
Of substance, and in things that live, of life;
But more refin’d, more spiritous, and pure,
As neerer to him plac’t or neerer tending
Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
Proportiond to each kind.  So from the root
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
More aerie, last the bright consummate floure
Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit
Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim’d
To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,
To intellectual, give both life and sense,
Fansie and understanding, whence the soule
Reason receives, and reason is her being,
Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
If I refuse not, but convert, as you,
To proper substance; time may come when men
With Angels may participate, and find
No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit
Improv’d by tract of time, and wingd ascend
Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice
Here or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell;
If ye be found obedient, and retain
Unalterably firm his love entire
Whose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy
Your fill what happiness this happie state
Can comprehend, incapable of more.

To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli’d.
O favourable spirit, propitious guest,
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set
From center to circumference, whereon
In contemplation of created things
By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,
What meant that caution joind, _If ye be found
obedient?_ can wee want obedience then
To him, or possibly his love desert
Who formd us from the dust, and plac’d us here
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
Human desires can seek or apprehend?

To whom the Angel.  Son of Heav’n and Earth,
Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;
That thou continu’st such, owe to thy self,
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
This was that caution giv’n thee; be advis’d.
God made thee perfet, not immutable;
And good he made thee, but to persevere
He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will
By nature free, not over-rul’d by Fate
Inextricable, or strict necessity;
Our voluntarie service he requires,
Not our necessitated, such with him
Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how
Can hearts, not free, be tri’d whether they serve
Willing or no, who will but what they must
By Destinie, and can no other choose?
My self and all th’ Angelic Host that stand
In sight of God enthron’d, our happie state
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
On other surety none; freely we serve.
Because wee freely love, as in our will
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
And som are fall’n, to disobedience fall’n,
And so from Heav’n to deepest Hell; O fall
From what high state of bliss into what woe!

To whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words
Attentive, and with more delighted eare
Divine instructer, I have heard, then when
Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills
Aereal Music send: nor knew I not
To be both will and deed created free;
Yet that we never shall forget to love
Our maker, and obey him whose command
Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts
Assur’d me and still assure: though what thou tellst
Hath past in Heav’n, som doubt within me move,
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,
The full relation, which must needs be strange,
Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun
Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins
His other half in the great Zone of Heav’n.

Thus _Adam_ made request, and _Raphael_
After short pause assenting, thus began.

High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,
Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate
To human sense th’ invisible exploits
Of warring Spirits; how without remorse
The ruin of so many glorious once
And perfet while they stood; how last unfould
The secrets of another world, perhaps
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
This is dispenc’t, and what surmounts the reach
Of human sense, I shall delineate so,
By lik’ning spiritual to corporal forms,
As may express them best, though what if Earth
Be but the shaddow of Heav’n, and things therein
Each to other like, more then on earth is thought?

As yet this world was not, and _Chaos_ wilde
Reignd where these Heav’ns now rowl, where Earth now rests
Upon her Center pois’d, when on a day
(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli’d
To motion, measures all things durable
By present, past, and future) on such day
As Heav’ns great Year brings forth, th’ Empyreal Host
Of Angels by Imperial summons call’d,
Innumerable before th’ Almighties Throne
Forthwith from all the ends of Heav’n appeerd
Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright
Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc’d,
Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare
Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve
Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;
Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz’d
Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love
Recorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes
Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,
By whom in bliss imbosom’d sat the Son,
Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.

Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
Hear my Decree, which unrevok’t shall stand.
This day I have begot whom I declare
My onely Son, and on this holy Hill
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold
At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;
And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow
All knees in Heav’n, and shall confess him Lord:
Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide
United as one individual Soule
For ever happie: him who disobeyes
Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls
Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place
Ordaind without redemption, without end.

So spake th’ Omnipotent, and with his words
All seemd well pleas’d, all seem’d, but were not all.
That day, as other solem dayes, they spent
In song and dance about the sacred Hill,
Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare
Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
Eccentric, intervolv’d, yet regular
Then most, when most irregular they seem:
And in thir motions harmonie Divine
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
Listens delighted.  Eevning approachd
(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,
We ours for change delectable, not need)
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,
Tables are set, and on a sudden pil’d
With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:
In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,
Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav’n.
They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet
Are fill’d, before th’ all bounteous King, who showrd
With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.
Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal’d
From that high mount of God, whence light & shade
Spring both, the face of brightest Heav’n had changd
To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there
In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos’d
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,
Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr
Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,
(Such are the Courts of God) Th’ Angelic throng
Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend
By living Streams among the Trees of Life,
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course
Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne
Alternate all night long: but not so wak’d
_Satan_, so call him now, his former name
Is heard no more Heav’n; he of the first,
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,
In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught
With envie against the Son of God, that day
Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd
_Messiah_ King anointed, could not beare
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.
Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain,
Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv’d
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave
Unworshipt, unobey’d the Throne supream
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate
Awak’ning, thus to him in secret spake.

Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close
Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree
Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips
Of Heav’ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
Both waking we were one; how then can now
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos’d;
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate
What doubtful may ensue, more in this place
To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;
Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night
Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
And all who under me thir Banners wave,
Homeward with flying march where we possess
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare
Fit entertainment to receive our King
The great _Messiah_, and his new commands,
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies
Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.

So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus’d
Bad influence into th’ unwarie brest
Of his Associate; hee together calls,
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,
Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,
That the most High commanding, now ere Night,
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav’n,
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
Or taint integritie; but all obey’d
The wonted signal, and superior voice
Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed
His name, and high was his degree in Heav’n;
His count’nance, as the Morning Starr that guides
The starrie flock, allur’d them, and with lyes
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Host:
Mean while th’ Eternal eye, whose sight discernes
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount
And from within the golden Lamps that burne
Nightly before him, saw without thir light
Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred
Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes
Were banded to oppose his high Decree;
And smiling to his onely Son thus said.

Son, thou in whom my glory I behold
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,
Neerly it now concernes us to be sure
Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms
We mean to hold what anciently we claim
Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe
Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;
Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie
In battel, what our Power is, or our right.
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw
With speed what force is left, and all imploy
In our defence, lest unawares we lose
This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.

To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer
Light’ning Divine, ineffable, serene,
Made answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes
Justly hast in derision, and secure
Laugh’st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,
Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate
Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power
Giv’n me to quell thir pride, and in event
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav’n.

So spake the Son, but _Satan_ with his Powers
Farr was advanc’t on winged speed, an Host
Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,
Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun
Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.
Regions they pass’d, the mightie Regencies
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which
All thy Dominion, _Adam_, is no more
Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,
And all the Sea, from one entire globose
Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass’d
At length into the limits of the North
They came, and _Satan_ to his Royal seat
High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount
Rais’d on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs
From Diamond Quarries hew’n, & Rocks of Gold,
The Palace of great _Lucifer_, (so call
That Structure in the Dialect of men
Interpreted) which not long after, hee
Affecting all equality with God,
In imitation of that Mount whereon
_Messiah_ was declar’d in sight of Heav’n,
The Mountain of the Congregation call’d;
For thither he assembl’d all his Train,
Pretending so commanded to consult
About the great reception of thir King,
Thither to come, and with calumnious Art
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.

Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,
If these magnific Titles yet remain
Not meerly titular, since by Decree
Another now hath to himself ingross’t
All Power, and us eclipst under the name
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste
Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,
This onely to consult how we may best
With what may be devis’d of honours new
Receive him coming to receive from us
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,
Too much to one, but double how endur’d,
To one and to his image now proclaim’d?
But what if better counsels might erect
Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?
Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend
The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust
To know ye right, or if ye know your selves
Natives and Sons of Heav’n possest before
By none, and if not equal all, yet free,
Equally free; for Orders and Degrees
Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.
Who can in reason then or right assume
Monarchie over such as live by right
His equals, if in power and splendor less,
In freedome equal? or can introduce
Law and Edict on us, who without law
Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,
And look for adoration to th’ abuse
Of those Imperial Titles which assert
Our being ordain’d to govern, not to serve?

Thus farr his bold discourse without controule
Had audience, when among the Seraphim
_Abdiel_, then whom none with more zeale ador’d
The Deitie, and divine commands obei’d,
Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe
The current of his fury thus oppos’d.

O argument blasphemous, false and proud!
Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav’n
Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate
In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.
Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne
The just Decree of God, pronounc’t and sworn,
That to his only Son by right endu’d
With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav’n
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist
Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,
And equal over equals to let Reigne,
One over all with unsucceeded power.
Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute
With him the points of libertie, who made
Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow’rs of Heav’n
Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib’d thir being?
Yet by experience taught we know how good,
And of our good, and of our dignitie
How provident he is, how farr from thought
To make us less, bent rather to exalt
Our happie state under one Head more neer
United.  But to grant it thee unjust,
That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:
Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count,
Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,
Equal to him begotten Son, by whom
As by his Word the mighty Father made
All things, ev’n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav’n
By him created in thir bright degrees,
Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam’d
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers
Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur’d,
But more illustrious made, since he the Head
One of our number thus reduc’t becomes,
His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done
Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,
And tempt not these; but hast’n to appease
Th’ incensed Father, and th’ incensed Son,
While Pardon may be found in time besought.

So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale
None seconded, as out of season judg’d,
Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic’d
Th’ Apostat, and more haughty thus repli’d.
That we were formd then saist thou? & the work
Of secondarie hands, by task transferd
From Father to his Son? strange point and new!
Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw
When this creation was? rememberst thou
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
We know no time when we were not as now;
Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais’d
By our own quick’ning power, when fatal course
Had circl’d his full Orbe, the birth mature
Of this our native Heav’n, Ethereal Sons.
Our puissance is our own, our own right hand
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try
Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold
Whether by supplication we intend
Address, and to begirt th’ Almighty Throne
Beseeching or besieging.  This report,
These tidings carrie to th’ anointed King;
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.

He said, and as the sound of waters deep
Hoarce murmur echo’d to his words applause
Through the infinite Host, nor less for that
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
Encompass’d round with foes, thus answerd bold.

O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,
Forsak’n of all good; I see thy fall
Determind, and thy hapless crew involv’d
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred
Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth
No more be troubl’d how to quit the yoke
Of Gods _Messiah_; those indulgent Laws
Will not be now voutsaf’t, other Decrees
Against thee are gon forth without recall;
That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject
Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake
Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise,
Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly
These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth
Impendent, raging into sudden flame
Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel
His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
Then who created thee lamenting learne,
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.

So spake the Seraph _Abdiel_ faithful found,
Among the faithless, faithful only hee;
Among innumerable false, unmov’d,
Unshak’n, unseduc’d, unterrifi’d
His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;
Nor number, nor example with him wrought
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind
Though single.  From amidst them forth he passd,
Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind
Superior, nor of violence fear’d aught;
And with retorted scorn his back he turn’d
On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom’d.

       THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK VI.

All night the dreadless Angel unpursu’d
Through Heav’ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,
Wak’t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
Unbarr’d the gates of Light.  There is a Cave
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav’n
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
Light issues forth, and at the other dore
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre
To veile the Heav’n, though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heav’n, arrayd in Gold
Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
Warr he perceav’d, warr in procinct, and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: gladly then he mixt
Among those friendly Powers who him receav’d
With joy and acclamations loud, that one
That of so many Myriads fall’n, yet one
Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supream; from whence a voice
From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.

Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought
The better fight, who single hast maintaind
Against revolted multitudes the Cause
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;
And for the testimonie of Truth hast born
Universal reproach, far worse to beare
Then violence: for this was all thy care
To stand approv’d in sight of God, though Worlds
Judg’d thee perverse: the easier conquest now
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue
By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,
Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King
_Messiah_, who by right of merit Reigns.
Goe _Michael_ of Celestial Armies Prince,
And thou in Military prowess next
_Gabriel_, lead forth to Battel these my Sons
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
By Thousands and by Millions rang’d for fight;
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav’n
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf
Of _Tartarus_, which ready opens wide
His fiery _Chaos_ to receave thir fall.

So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl
In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe
Of wrauth awak’t: nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:
At which command the Powers Militant,
That stood for Heav’n, in mighty Quadrate joyn’d
Of Union irresistible, mov’d on
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound
Of instrumental Harmonie that breath’d
Heroic Ardor to advent’rous deeds
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause
Of God and his _Messiah_.  On they move
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,
Nor streit’ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore
Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind
Of Birds in orderly array on wing
Came summond over _Eden_ to receive
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract
Of Heav’n they march’d, and many a Province wide
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
Farr in th’ Horizon to the North appeer’d
From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht
In battailous aspect, and neerer view
Bristl’d with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng’d, and Shields
Various, with boastful Argument portraid,
The banded Powers of _Satan_ hasting on
With furious expedition; for they weend
That self same day by fight, or by surprize
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
To set the envier of his State, the proud
Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov’d fond and vain
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd
At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
So oft in Festivals of joy and love
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
Hymning th’ Eternal Father: but the shout
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
High in the midst exalted as a God
Th’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos’d
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
’Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front
Presented stood in terrible array
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,
On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn’d,
_Satan_ with vast and haughtie strides advanc’t,
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;
_Abdiel_ that sight endur’d not, where he stood
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
And thus his own undaunted heart explores.

O Heav’n! that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie
Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might
There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?
His puissance, trusting in th’ Almightie’s aide,
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri’d
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so
Most reason is that Reason overcome.

So pondering, and from his armed Peers
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
His daring foe, at this prevention more
Incens’t, and thus securely him defi’d.

Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht
The highth of thy aspiring unoppos’d,
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side
Abandond at the terror of thy Power
Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain
Against th’ Omnipotent to rise in Arms;
Who out of smallest things could without end
Have rais’d incessant Armies to defeat
Thy folly; or with solitarie hand
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow
Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith
Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then
To thee not visible, when I alone
Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent
From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late
How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.

  Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
Thus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre
Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst
From flight, seditious Angel, to receave
Thy merited reward, the first assay
Of this right hand provok’t, since first that tongue
Inspir’d with contradiction durst oppose
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met
Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel
Vigour Divine within them, can allow
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
From me som Plume, that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest: this pause between
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;
At first I thought that Libertie and Heav’n
To heav’nly Soules had bin all one; but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;
Such hast thou arm’d, the Minstrelsie of Heav’n,
Servilitie with freedom to contend,
As both thir deeds compar’d this day shall prove.

To whom in brief thus _Abdiel_ stern repli’d.
Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou deprav’st it with the name
Of _Servitude_ to serve whom God ordains,
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excells
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
To serve th’ unwise, or him who hath rebelld
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall’d;
Yet leudly dar’st our ministring upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve
In Heav’n God ever blessed, and his Divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obey’d,
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.

So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud Crest of _Satan_, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong, had push’t a Mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis’d
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
Thus foil’d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire
Of Battel: whereat _Michael_ bid sound
Th’ Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav’n
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung
_Hosanna_ to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn’d
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,
And clamour such as heard in Heav’n till now
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray’d
Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles
Of brazen Chariots rag’d; dire was the noise
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
Sounder fierie Cope together rush’d
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage; all Heav’n
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could weild
These Elements, and arm him with the force
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power
Armie against Armie numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;
Had not th’ Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heav’n high over-rul’d
And limited thir might; though numberd such
As each divided Legion might have seemd
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
Of Battel, open when, and when to close
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
That argu’d fear; each on himself reli’d,
As onely in his arm the moment lay
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale
The Battel hung; till _Satan_, who that day
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes
No equal, raunging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confus’d, at length
Saw where the Sword of _Michael_ smote, and fell’d
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and oppos’d the rockie Orb
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
A vast circumference: At his approach
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile
Surceas’d, and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine War in Heav’n, the arch foe subdu’d
Or Captive drag’d in Chains, with hostile frown
And visage all enflam’d first thus began.

Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
Unnam’d in Heav’n, now plenteous, as thou seest
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb’d
Heav’ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought
Miserie, uncreated till the crime
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill’d
Thy malice into thousands, once upright
And faithful, now prov’d false.  But think not here
To trouble Holy Rest; Heav’n casts thee out
From all her Confines.  Heav’n the seat of bliss
Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.
Hence then, and evil go with thee along
Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,
Or som more sudden vengeance wing’d from God
Precipitate thee with augmented paine.

So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
The Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind
Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds
Thou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats
To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end
The strife which thou call’st evil, but wee style
The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,
Or turn this Heav’n it self into the Hell
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,
And join him nam’d _Almightie_ to thy aid,
I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.

They ended parle, and both addrest for fight
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
Human imagination to such highth
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,
Stood they or mov’d, in stature, motion, arms
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav’n.
Now wav’d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields
Blaz’d opposite, while expectation stood
In horror; from each hand with speed retir’d
Where erst was thickest fight, th’ Angelic throng,
And left large field, unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion, such as to set forth
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
Among the Constellations warr were sprung,
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne
Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,
Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.
Together both with next to Almightie Arme,
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim’d
That might determine, and not need repeate,
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd
In might or swift prevention; but the sword
Of _Michael_ from the Armorie of God
Was giv’n him temperd so, that neither keen
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
The sword of _Satan_ with steep force to smite
Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,
But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar’d
All his right side; then _Satan_ first knew pain,
And writh’d him to and fro convolv’d; so sore
The griding sword with discontinuous wound
Pass’d through him, but th’ Ethereal substance clos’d
Not long divisible, and from the gash
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow’d
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
By Angels many and strong, who interpos’d
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir’d
From off the files of warr; there they him laid
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
To find himself not matchless, and his pride
Humbl’d by such rebuke, so farr beneath
His confidence to equal God in power.
Yet soon he heal’d; for Spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part, not as frail man
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,
Cannot but by annihilating die;
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.

Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd
Memorial, where the might of _Gabriel_ fought,
And with fierce Ensignes pierc’d the deep array
Of _Moloc_ furious King, who him defi’d,
And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound
Threatn’d, nor from the Holie One of Heav’n
Refrein’d his tongue blasphemous; but anon
Down clov’n to the waste, with shatterd Armes
And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing
_Uriel_ and _Raphael_ his vaunting foe,
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,
Vanquish’d _Adramelec_, and _Asmadai_,
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
Disdain’d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,
Mangl’d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.
Nor stood unmindful _Abdiel_ to annoy
The Atheist crew, but with redoubl’d blow
_Ariel_ and _Arioc_, and the violence
Of _Ramiel_ scorcht and blasted overthrew.
I might relate of thousands, and thir names
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
Angels contented with thir fame in Heav’n
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome
Canceld from Heav’n and sacred memorie,
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise
And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires
Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:
Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.

And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv’d,
With many an inrode gor’d; deformed rout
Enter’d, and foul disorder; all the ground
With shiverd armour strow’n, and on a heap
Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd
And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld
Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host
Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris’d,
Then first with fear surpris’d and sense of paine
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
By sinne of disobedience, till that hour
Not liable to fear or flight or paine.
Far otherwise th’ inviolable Saints
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc’t entire,
Invulnerable, impenitrably arm’d:
Such high advantages thir innocence
Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,
Not to have disobei’d; in fight they stood
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain’d
By wound, though from thir place by violence mov’d.

Now Night her course began, and over Heav’n
Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos’d,
And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:
Under her Cloudie covert both retir’d,
Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field
_Michael_ and his Angels prevalent
Encamping, plac’d in Guard thir Watches round,
Cherubic waving fires: on th’ other part
_Satan_ with his rebellious disappeerd,
Far in the dark dislodg’d, and void of rest,
His Potentates to Councel call’d by night;
And in the midst thus undismai’d began.

O now in danger tri’d, now known in Armes
Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,
Found worthy not of Libertie alone,
Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,
Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,
Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight,
(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his Throne, and judg’d
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
Of future we may deem him, though till now
Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly arm’d,
Some disadvantage we endur’d and paine,
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
Since now we find this our Empyreal forme
Incapable of mortal injurie
Imperishable, and though peirc’d with wound,
Soon closing, and by native vigour heal’d.
Of evil then so small as easie think
The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
Or equal what between us made the odds,
In Nature none: if other hidden cause
Left them Superiour, while we can preserve
Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,
Due search and consultation will disclose.

He sat; and in th’ assembly next upstood
_Nisroc_, of Principalities the prime;
As one he stood escap’t from cruel fight,
Sore toild, his riv’n Armes to havoc hewn,
And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.
Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
For Gods, and too unequal work we find
Against unequal armes to fight in paine,
Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,
But live content, which is the calmest life:
But pain is perfet miserie, the worst
Of evils, and excessive, overturnes
All patience.  He who therefore can invent
With what more forcible we may offend
Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme
Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves
No less then for deliverance what we owe.

Whereto with look compos’d _Satan_ repli’d.
Not uninvented that, which thou aright
Beleivst so main to our success, I bring;
Which of us who beholds the bright surface
Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,
This continent of spacious Heav’n, adornd
With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold,
Whose Eye so superficially surveyes
These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht
With Heav’ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth
So beauteous, op’ning to the ambient light.
These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep
Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame,
Which into hallow Engins long and round
Thick-rammd, at th’ other bore with touch of fire
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
From far with thundring noise among our foes
Such implements of mischief as shall dash
To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,
Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.
He ended, and his words thir drooping chere
Enlightn’d, and thir languisht hope reviv’d.
Th’ invention all admir’d, and each, how hee
To be th’ inventer miss’d, so easie it seemd
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
Impossible: yet haply of thy Race
In future dayes, if Malice should abound,
Some one intent on mischief, or inspir’d
With dev’lish machination might devise
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.
Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,
None arguing stood, innumerable hands
Were ready, in a moment up they turnd
Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath
Th’ originals of Nature in thir crude
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame
They found, they mingl’d, and with suttle Art,
Concocted and adusted they reduc’d
To blackest grain, and into store conveyd:
Part hidd’n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
So all ere day spring, under conscious Night
Secret they finish’d, and in order set,
With silent circumspection unespi’d.
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav’n appeerd
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,
Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,
Where lodg’d, or whither fled, or if for fight,
In motion or in alt: him soon they met
Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail
_Zephiel_, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri’d.

Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud
He comes, and settl’d in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure: let each
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each
Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,
Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,
If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,
But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.
So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon
In order, quit of all impediment;
Instant without disturb they took Allarm,
And onward move Embattelld; when behold
Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
Training his devilish Enginrie, impal’d
On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood
A while, but suddenly at head appeerd
_Satan_: And thus was heard Commanding loud.

Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;
That all may see who hate us, how we seek
Peace and composure, and with open brest
Stand readie to receive them, if they like
Our overture, and turn not back perverse;
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,
Heav’n witness thou anon, while we discharge
Freely our part: yee who appointed stand
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
What we propound, and loud that all may hear.

So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
Divided, and to either Flank retir’d.
Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,
A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem’d
Or hollow’d bodies made of Oak or Firr
With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell’d)
Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes
With hideous orifice gap’t on us wide,
Portending hollow truce; at each behind
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,
Collected stood within our thoughts amus’d,
Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds
Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli’d
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,
But soon obscur’d with smoak, all Heav’n appeerd,
From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar
Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule
Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
Level’d, with such impetuous furie smote,
That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl’d;
The sooner for thir Arms, unarm’d they might
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove; but now
Foule dissipation follow’d and forc’t rout;
Nor serv’d it to relax thir serried files.
What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse
Repeated, and indecent overthrow
Doubl’d, would render them yet more despis’d,
And to thir foes a laughter; for in view
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row
In posture to displode thir second tire
Of Thunder: back defeated to return
They worse abhorr’d.  _Satan_ beheld thir plight,
And to his Mates thus in derision call’d.

O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,
To entertain them fair with open Front
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms
Of composition, strait they chang’d thir minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose
If our proposals once again were heard
We should compel them to a quick result.

To whom thus _Belial_ in like gamesom mood.
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,
Of hard contents, and full of force urg’d home,
Such as we might perceive amus’d them all,
And stumbl’d many, who receives them right,
Had need from head to foot well understand;
Not understood, this gift they have besides,
They shew us when our foes walk not upright.

So they among themselves in pleasant veine
Stood scoffing, highthn’d in thir thoughts beyond
All doubt of Victorie, eternal might
To match with thir inventions they presum’d
So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
And all his Host derided, while they stood
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac’d)
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
(For Earth hath this variety from Heav’n
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,
From thir foundations loosning to and fro
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,
Be sure, and terrour seis’d the rebel Host,
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the Mountains upward turn’d,
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row
They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm’d,
Thir armor help’d thir harm, crush’t in and brus’d
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
The rest in imitation to like Armes
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills
Hurl’d to and fro with jaculation dire,
That under ground they fought in dismal shade;
Infernal noise; Warr seem’d a civil Game
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav’n
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,
Had not th’ Almightie Father where he sits
Shrin’d in his Sanctuarie of Heav’n secure,
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
This tumult, and permitted all, advis’d:
That his great purpose he might so fulfill,
To honour his Anointed Son aveng’d
Upon his enemies, and to declare
All power on him transferr’d: whence to his Son
Th’ Assessor of his Throne he thus began.

Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov’d,
Son in whose face invisible is beheld
Visibly, what by Deitie I am,
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,
Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,
Since _Michael_ and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,
Equal in their Creation they were form’d,
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless, and no solution will be found:
Warr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,
And to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,
With Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makes
Wild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;
For thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farr
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine
Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou
Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace
Immense I have transfus’d, that all may know
In Heav’n and Hell thy Power above compare,
And this perverse Commotion governd thus,
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles
That shake Heav’ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out
From all Heav’ns bounds into the utter Deep:
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
God and _Messiah_ his anointed King.

He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct
Shon full, he all his Father full exprest
Ineffably into his face receiv’d,
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.

O Father, O Supream of heav’nly Thrones,
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,
As is most just; this I my Glorie account,
My exaltation, and my whole delight,
That thou in me well pleas’d, declarst thy will
Fulfill’d, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov’st:
But whom thou hat’st, I hate, and can put on
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
Armd with thy might, rid heav’n of these rebell’d,
To thir prepar’d ill Mansion driven down
To chains of Darkness, and th’ undying Worm,
That from thy just obedience could revolt,
Whom to obey is happiness entire.
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th’ impure
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount
Unfained _Halleluiahs_ to thee sing,
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.
So said, he o’re his Scepter bowing, rose
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,
And the third sacred Morn began to shine
Dawning through Heav’n: forth rush’d with whirlwind sound
The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd
Of radiant _Urim_, work divinely wrought,
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie
Sate Eagle-wing’d, beside him hung his Bow
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor’d,
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld
Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
He onward came, farr off his coming shon,
And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:
Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron’d.
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own
First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz’d,
When the great Ensign of _Messiah_ blaz’d
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav’n:
Under whose Conduct _Michael_ soon reduc’d
His Armie, circumfus’d on either Wing,
Under thir Head imbodied all in one.
Before him Power Divine his way prepar’d;
At his command the uprooted Hills retir’d
Each to his place, they heard his voice and went
Obsequious, Heav’n his wonted face renewd,
And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil’d.
This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur’d,
And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
In heav’nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what Signs availe,
Or Wonders move th’ obdurate to relent?
They hard’nd more by what might most reclame,
Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight
Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,
Stood reimbattell’d fierce, by force or fraud
Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile
Against God and _Messiah_, or to fall
In universal ruin last, and now
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
To all his Host on either hand thus spake.

Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand
Ye Angels arm’d, this day from Battel rest;
Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs,
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;
Number to this dayes work is not ordain’d
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd
By mee; not you but mee they have despis’d,
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,
Because the Father, t’ whom in Heav’n supream
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,
Hath honourd me according to his will.
Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig’n’d;
That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee
In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,
Or I alone against them, since by strength
They measure all, of other excellence
Not emulous, nor care who them excells;
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.

So spake the Son, and into terrour chang’d
His count’nance too severe to be beheld
And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.
At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes
Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.
Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,
Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,
All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon
Among them he arriv’d; in his right hand
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent
Before him, such as in thir Soules infix’d
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,
All courage; down thir idle weapons drop’d;
O’re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
That wish’d the Mountains now might be again
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag’d Foure,
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,
One Spirit in them rul’d, and every eye
Glar’d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
Among th’ accurst, that witherd all thir strength,
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall’n.
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check’d
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav’n:
The overthrown he rais’d, and as a Heard
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu’d
With terrors and with furies to the bounds
And Chrystall wall of Heav’n, which op’ning wide,
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos’d
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse
Urg’d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw
Down from the verge of Heav’n, Eternal wrauth
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.

Hell heard th’ unsufferable noise, Hell saw
Heav’n ruining from Heav’n and would have fled
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
Nine dayes they fell; confounded _Chaos_ roard,
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall
Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout
Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last
Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos’d,
Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire
Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.
Disburd’nd Heav’n rejoic’d, and soon repaird
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.
Sole Victor from th’ expulsion of his Foes
_Messiah_ his triumphal Chariot turnd:
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,
With Jubilie advanc’d; and as they went,
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,
Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv’n,
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode
Triumphant through mid Heav’n, into the Courts
And Temple of his mightie Father Thron’d
On high; who into Glorie him receav’d,
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.

Thus measuring things in Heav’n by things on Earth
At thy request, and that thou maist beware
By what is past, to thee I have reveal’d
What might have else to human Race bin hid;
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav’n
Among th’ Angelic Powers, and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld
With _Satan_, hee who envies now thy state,
Who now is plotting how he may seduce
Thee also from obedience, that with him
Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake
His punishment, Eternal miserie;
Which would be all his solace and revenge,
As a despite don against the most High,
Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.
But list’n not to his Temptations, warne
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard
By terrible Example the reward
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.

       THE END OF THE SIXTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST.





  BOOK VII.

Descend from Heav’n _Urania_, by that name
If rightly thou art call’d, whose Voice divine
Following, above th’ _Olympian_ Hill I soare,
Above the flight of _Pegasean_ wing.
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
Of old _Olympus_ dwell’st, but Heav’nlie borne,
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow’d,
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play
In presence of th’ Almightie Father, pleas’d
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee
Into the Heav’n of Heav’ns I have presum’d,
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down
Return me to my Native Element:
Least from this flying Steed unrein’d, (as once
_Bellerophon_, though from a lower Clime)
Dismounted, on th’ _Aleian_ Field I fall
Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang’d
To hoarce or mute, though fall’n on evil dayes,
On evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;
In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
Visit’st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,
_Urania_, and fit audience find, though few.
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance
Of _Bacchus_ and his Revellers, the Race
Of that wilde Rout that tore the _Thracian_ Bard
In _Rhodope_, where Woods and Rocks had Eares
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:
For thou art Heav’nlie, shee an empty dreame.

Say Goddess, what ensu’d when _Raphael_,
The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn’d
_Adam_ by dire example to beware
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven
To those Apostates, least the like befall
In Paradise to _Adam_ or his Race,
Charg’d not to touch the interdicted Tree,
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
So easily obeyd amid the choice
Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,
Though wandring.  He with his consorted _Eve_
The storie heard attentive, and was fill’d
With admiration, and deep Muse to heare
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought
So unimaginable as hate in Heav’n,
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss
With such confusion: but the evil soon
Driv’n back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
With Blessedness.  Whence _Adam_ soon repeal’d
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know
What neerer might concern him, how this World
Of Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,
When, and whereof created, for what cause,
What within _Eden_ or without was done
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allay’d still eyes the current streame,
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
Proceeded thus to ask his Heav’nly Guest.

Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d
Divine Interpreter, by favour sent
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:
For which to the infinitly Good we owe
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
Receave with solemne purpose to observe
Immutably his sovran will, the end
Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf’t
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,
Deign to descend now lower, and relate
What may no less perhaps availe us known,
How first began this Heav’n which we behold
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus’d
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause
Mov’d the Creator in his holy Rest
Through all Eternitie so late to build
In _Chaos_, and the work begun, how soon
Absolv’d, if unforbid thou maist unfould
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
To magnifie his works, the more we know.
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav’n
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,
And longer will delay to heare thee tell
His Generation, and the rising Birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.

Thus _Adam_ his illustrous Guest besought:

And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.
This also thy request with caution askt
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
Thy hearing, such Commission from above
I have receav’d, to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not reveal’d, which th’ invisible King,
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
Anough is left besides to search and know.
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
In measure what the mind may well contain,
Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.

Know then, that after _Lucifer_ from Heav’n
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
Into his place, and the great Son returnd
Victorious with his Saints, th’ Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.

At least our envious Foe hath fail’d, who thought
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength, the seat
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,
He trusted to have seis’d, and into fraud
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,
Thir station, Heav’n yet populous retaines
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:
But least his heart exalt him in the harme
Already done, to have dispeopl’d Heav’n,
My damage fondly deem’d, I can repaire
That detriment, if such it be to lose
Self-lost, and in a moment will create
Another World, out of one man a Race
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
Not here, till by degrees of merit rais’d
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither, under long obedience tri’d,
And Earth be chang’d to Heavn, & Heav’n to Earth,
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav’n,
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heav’n and Earth,
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
Though I uncircumscrib’d my self retire,
And put not forth my goodness, which is free
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.

So spake th’ Almightie, and to what he spake
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
Then time or motion, but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told,
So told as earthly notion can receave.
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav’n
When such was heard declar’d the Almightie’s will;
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out th’ ungodly from his sight
And th’ habitations of the just; to him
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain’d
Good out of evil to create, in stead
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
On his great Expedition now appeer’d,
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown’d
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love
Immense, and all his Father in him shon.
About his Chariot numberless were pour’d
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing’d,
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg’d
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,
Attendant on thir Lord: Heav’n op’nd wide
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
On heav’nly ground they stood, and from the shore
They view’d the vast immeasurable Abyss
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,
Up from the bottom turn’d by furious windes
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
Heav’ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.

Silence, ye troubl’d waves, and thou Deep, peace,
Said then th’ Omnific Word, your discord end:

Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode
Farr into _Chaos_, and the World unborn;
For _Chaos_ heard his voice: him all his Traine
Follow’d in bright procession to behold
Creation, and the wonders of his might.
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand
He took the golden Compasses, prepar’d
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
This Universe, and all created things:
One foot he center’d, and the other turn’d
Round through the vast profunditie obscure,
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,
This be thy just Circumference, O World.
Thus God the Heav’n created, thus the Earth,
Matter unform’d and void: Darkness profound
Cover’d th’ Abyss: but on the watrie calme
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,
And vital vertue infus’d, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg’d
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob’d
Like things to like, the rest to several place
Disparted, and between spun out the Air,
And Earth self-ballanc’t on her Center hung.

Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
To journie through the airie gloom began,
Sphear’d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle
Sojourn’d the while.  God saw the Light was good;
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
He nam’d.  Thus was the first Day Eev’n and Morn:
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
Birth-day of Heav’n and Earth; with joy and shout
The hollow Universal Orb they fill’d,
And touch’t thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais’d
God and his works, Creatour him they sung,
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.

Again, God said, let ther be Firmament
Amid the Waters, and let it divide
The Waters from the Waters: and God made
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus’d
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
The Waters underneath from those above
Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule
Of _Chaos_ farr remov’d, least fierce extreames
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
And Heav’n he nam’d the Firmament: So Eev’n
And Morning _Chorus_ sung the second Day.

The Earth was form’d, but in the Womb as yet
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv’d,
Appeer’d not: over all the face of Earth
Main Ocean flow’d, not idle, but with warme
Prolific humour soft’ning all her Globe,
Fermented the great Mother to conceave,
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said
Be gather’d now ye Waters under Heav’n
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:
So high as heav’d the tumid Hills, so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
For haste; such flight the great command impress’d
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;
Easie, e’re God had bid the ground be drie,
All but within those banks, where Rivers now
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
Of congregated Waters he call’d Seas:
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th’ Earth
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,
And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn’d,
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour’d
Op’ning thir various colours, and made gay
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,
Forth flourish’t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
Embattell’d in her field: add the humble Shrub,
And Bush with frizl’d hair implicit: last
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm’d
Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,
With tufts the vallies & each fountain side,
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now
Seemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each
Plant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth
God made, and every Herb, before it grew
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:
So Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.

Again th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights
High in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,
And set them in the Firmament of Heav’n
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
A mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon
Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,
And sowd with Starrs the Heav’n thick as a field:
Of Light by farr the greater part he took,
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac’d
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine
Her gather’d beams, great Palace now of Light.
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs
Repairing, in thir gold’n Urns draw Light,
And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;
By tincture or reflection they augment
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight
So farr remote, with diminution seen.
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
Regent of Day, and all th’ Horizon round
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run
His Longitude through Heav’ns high rode: the gray
Dawn, and the _Pleiades_ before him danc’d
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
But opposite in leveld West was set
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
From him, for other light she needed none
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
Revolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day.

And God said, let the Waters generate
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings
Displayd on the op’n Firmament of Heav’n.
And God created the great Whales, and each
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
The waters generated by thir kindes,
And every Bird of wing after his kinde;
And saw that it was good, and bless’d them, saying,
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
And let the Fowle be multiply’d on the Earth.
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
Show to the Sun thir wav’d coats dropt with Gold,
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles
Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.
Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares
Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos’d
Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge
They summ’d thir Penns, and soaring th’ air sublime
With clang despis’d the ground, under a cloud
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise
In common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire
Floats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
Solac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings
Till Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal
Ceas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground
Walk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine
Adorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,
Ev’ning and Morn solemniz’d the Fift day.

The Sixt, and of Creation last arose
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,
Let th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
Each in their kinde.  The Earth obey’d, and strait
Op’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,
Limb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:
The grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale
Rising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould
_Behemoth_ biggest born of Earth upheav’d
His vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
Insect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
These as a line thir long dimension drew,
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv’d
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
Of future, in small room large heart enclos’d,
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps
Hereafter, join’d in her popular Tribes
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer’d
The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
With Honey stor’d: the rest are numberless,
And thou thir Natures know’st, and gav’st them Names,
Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown
The Serpent suttl’st Beast of all the field,
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
Now Heav’n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovly smil’d; Aire, Water, Earth,
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain’d;
There wanted yet the Master work, the end
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
And Brute as other Creatures, but endu’d
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect
His Stature, and upright with Front serene
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heav’n,
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in Devotion, to adore
And worship God Supream, who made him chief
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father (For where is not hee
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.

Let us make now Man in our image, Man
In our similitude, and let them rule
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
This said, he formd thee, _Adam_, thee O Man
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath’d
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee
Created thee, in the Image of God
Express, and thou becam’st a living Soul.
Male he created thee, but thy consort
Femal for Race; then bless’d Mankinde, and said,
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
Wherever thus created, for no place
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know’st
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
Delectable both to behold and taste;
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th’ Earth yeelds,
Varietie without end; but of the Tree
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
Thou mai’st not; in the day thou eat’st, thou di’st;
Death is the penaltie impos’d, beware,
And govern well thy appetite, least sin
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
Here finish’d hee, and all that he had made
View’d, and behold all was entirely good;
So Ev’n and Morn accomplish’d the Sixt day:
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd
Up to the Heav’n of Heav’ns his high abode,
Thence to behold this new created World
Th’ addition of his Empire, how it shew’d
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode
Followd with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun’d
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire
Resounded, (thou remember’st, for thou heardst)
The Heav’ns and all the Constellations rung,
The Planets in thir stations list’ning stood,
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,
Open, ye Heav’ns, your living dores; let in
The great Creator from his work returnd
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged Messengers
On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav’n,
That open’d wide her blazing Portals, led
To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest
Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh
Eev’ning arose in _Eden_, for the Sun
Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
Of Heav’ns high-seated top, th’ Impereal Throne
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,
The Filial Power arriv’d, and sate him down
With his great Father (for he also went
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain’d,
Author and end of all things, and from work
Now resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,
As resting on that day from all his work,
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
Temper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,
Great are thy works, _Jehovah_, infinite
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee; greater now in thy return
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
Thy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create
Is greater then created to destroy.
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might: his evil
Thou usest, and from thence creat’st more good.
Witness this new-made World, another Heav’n
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view
On the cleer _Hyaline_, the Glassie Sea;
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr’s
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World
Of destind habitation; but thou know’st
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus’d,
Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc’t,
Created in his Image, there to dwell
And worship him, and in reward to rule
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
And multiply a Race of Worshippers
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know
Thir happiness, and persevere upright.

So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,
With _Halleluiahs_: Thus was Sabbath kept.
And thy request think now fulfill’d, that ask’d
How first this World and face of things began,
And what before thy memorie was don
From the beginning, that posteritie
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

To whom thus _Adam_ gratefully repli’d.
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee, Divine
Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf’t
This friendly condescention to relate
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard
VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
With glorie attributed to the high
Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,
VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.
VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld
Of Heav’n and Earth consisting, and compute,
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,
An Atom, with the Firmament compar’d
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle
Spaces incomprehensible (for such
Thir distance argues and thir swift return
Diurnal) meerly to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
One day and night; in all thir vast survey
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
So many nobler Bodies to create,
Greater so manifold to this one use,
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,
That better might with farr less compass move,
Serv’d by more noble then her self, attaines
Her end without least motion, and receaves,
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.

So spake our Sire, and by his count’nance seemd
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which _Eve_
Perceaving where she sat retir’d in sight,
With lowliness Majestic from her seat,
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,
To visit how they prosper’d, bud and bloom,
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
Delighted, or not capable her eare
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv’d,
_Adam_ relating, she sole Auditress;
Her Husband the Relater she preferr’d
Before the Angel, and of him to ask
Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip
Not Words alone pleas’d her.  O when meet now
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn’d?
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;
Not unattended, for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
And from about her shot Darts of desire
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.
And _Raphael_ now to _Adam_’s doubt propos’d
Benevolent and facil thus repli’d.

To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav’n
Is as the Book of God before thee set,
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne
His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:
This to attain, whether Heav’n move or Earth,
Imports not, if thou reck’n right, the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
His secrets to be scann’d by them who ought
Rather admire; or if they list to try
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav’ns
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav’n
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear
With Centric and Eccentric scribl’d o’re,
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest
That Bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright, nor Heav’n such journies run,
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves
The benefit: consider first, that Great
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth
Though, in comparison of Heav’n, so small,
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd
His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.
And for the Heav’ns wide Circuit, let it speak
The Makers high magnificence, who built
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;
That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
An Edifice too large for him to fill,
Lodg’d in a small partition, and the rest
Ordain’d for uses to his Lord best known.
The swiftness of those Circles attribute,
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
That to corporeal substances could adde
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav’n
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv’d
In _Eden_, distance inexpressible
By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,
Admitting Motion in the Heav’ns, to shew
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov’d;
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
God to remove his wayes from human sense,
Plac’d Heav’n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,
If it presume, might erre in things too high,
And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs
By his attractive vertue and thir own
Incited, dance about him various rounds?
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,
In six thou seest, and what if sev’nth to these
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,
Insensibly three different Motions move?
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,
Mov’d contrarie with thwart obliquities,
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos’d,
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day
Travelling East, and with her part averse
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part
Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce
Fruits in her soft’nd Soile, for some to eate
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie
Communicating Male and Femal Light,
Which two great Sexes animate the World,
Stor’d in each Orb perhaps with some that live.
For such vast room in Nature unpossest
By living Soule, desert and desolate,
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr
Down to this habitable, which returnes
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
But whether thus these things, or whether not,
Whether the Sun predominant in Heav’n
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,
Or Shee from West her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev’n,
And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,
Wherever plac’t, let him dispose: joy thou
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
And thy faire _Eve_; Heav’n is for thee too high
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there
Live, in what state, condition or degree,
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal’d
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav’n.

To whom thus _Adam_ cleerd of doubt, repli’d.
How fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure
Intelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,
And freed from intricacies, taught to live,
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,
And not molest us, unless we our selves
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;
Till warn’d, or by experience taught, she learne,
That not to know at large of things remote
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know
That which before us lies in daily life,
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,
And renders us in things that most concerne
Unpractis’d, unprepar’d, and still to seek.
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand
Useful, whence haply mention may arise
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign’d.
Thee I have heard relating what was don
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest
How suttly to detaine thee I devise,
Inviting thee to hear while I relate,
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav’n,
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine
Imbu’d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.

To whom thus _Raphael_ answer’d heav’nly meek.
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour’d,
Inward and outward both, his image faire:
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.
Nor less think wee in Heav’n of thee on Earth
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:
For God we see hath honour’d thee, and set
On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;
For I that Day was absent, as befell,
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;
Squar’d in full Legion (such command we had)
To see that none thence issu’d forth a spie,
Or enemie, while God was in his work,
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,
Destruction with Creation might have mixt.
Not that they durst without his leave attempt,
But us he sends upon his high behests
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure
Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut
The dismal Gates, and barricado’d strong;
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,
Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.
Glad we return’d up to the coasts of Light
Ere Sabbath Eev’ning: so we had in charge.
But thy relation now; for I attend,
Pleas’d with thy words no less then thou with mine.

So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
For Man to tell how human Life began
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?
Desire with thee still longer to converse
Induc’d me.  As new wak’t from soundest sleep
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun
Soon dri’d, and on the reaking moisture fed.
Strait toward Heav’n my wondring Eyes I turnd,
And gaz’d a while the ample Skie, till rais’d
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,
As thitherward endevoring, and upright
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk’d, or flew,
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil’d,
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow’d.
My self I then perus’d, and Limb by Limb
Survey’d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
But who I was, or where, or from what cause,
Knew not; to speak I tri’d, and forthwith spake,
My Tongue obey’d and readily could name
What e’re I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,
And thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?
Not of my self; by some great Maker then,
In goodness and in power praeeminent;
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
From whom I have that thus I move and live,
And feel that I am happier then I know.
While thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld
This happie Light, when answer none return’d,
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep
First found me, and with soft oppression seis’d
My droused sense, untroubl’d, though I thought
I then was passing to my former state
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,
Whose inward apparition gently mov’d
My Fancy to believe I yet had being,
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, _Adam_, rise,
First Man, of Men innumerable ordain’d
First Father, call’d by thee I come thy Guide
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar’d.
So saying, by the hand he took me rais’d,
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,
A Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw
Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree
Load’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye
Tempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,
Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw
In adoration at his feet I fell
Submiss: he rear’d me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest
Above, or round about thee or beneath.
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
But of the Tree whose operation brings
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,
And shun the bitter consequence: for know,
The day thou eat’st thereof, my sole command
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;
From that day mortal, and this happie State
Shalt loose, expell’d from hence into a World
Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc’d
The rigid interdiction, which resounds
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect
Return’d and gratious purpose thus renew’d.
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords
Possess it, and all things that therein live,
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie
With low subjection; understand the same
Of Fish within thir watry residence,
Not hither summond, since they cannot change
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold
Approaching two and two, These cowring low
With blandishment, each Bird stoop’d on his wing.
I nam’d them, as they pass’d, and understood
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu’d
My sudden apprehension: but in these
I found not what me thought I wanted still;
And to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.

O by what Name, for thou above all these,
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I
Adore thee, Author of this Universe,
And all this good to man, for whose well being
So amply, and with hands so liberal
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee
I see not who partakes.  In solitude
What happiness, who can enjoy alone,
Or all enjoying, what contentment find?
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,
As with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.

What call’st thou solitude, is not the Earth
With various living creatures, and the Aire
Replenisht, and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee, know’st thou not
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,
And reason not contemptibly; with these
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.
So spake the Universal Lord, and seem’d
So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor’d,
And humble deprecation thus repli’d.

Let not my words offend thee, Heav’nly Power,
My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
And these inferiour farr beneath me set?
Among unequals what societie
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?
Which must be mutual, in proportion due
Giv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie
The one intense, the other still remiss
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak
Such as I seek, fit to participate
All rational delight, wherein the brute
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.

Whereto th’ Almighty answer’d, not displeas’d.
A nice and suttle happiness I see
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice
Of thy Associates, _Adam_, and wilt taste
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest
Of happiness, or not? who am alone
From all Eternitie, for none I know
Second to mee or like, equal much less.
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those
To me inferiour, infinite descents
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?

He ceas’d, I lowly answer’d.  To attaine
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee
Is no deficience found; not so is Man,
But in degree, the cause of his desire
By conversation with his like to help,
Or solace his defects.  No need that thou
Shouldst propagat, already infinite;
And through all numbers absolute, though One;
But Man by number is to manifest
His single imperfection, and beget
Like of his like, his Image multipli’d,
In unitie defective, which requires
Collateral love, and deerest amitie.
Thou in thy secresie although alone,
Best with thy self accompanied, seek’st not
Social communication, yet so pleas’d,
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt
Of Union or Communion, deifi’d;
I by conversing cannot these erect
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.
Thus I embold’nd spake, and freedom us’d
Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain’d
This answer from the gratious voice Divine.

Thus farr to try thee, _Adam_, I was pleas’d,
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,
Which thou hast rightly nam’d, but of thy self,
Expressing well the spirit within thee free,
My Image, not imparted to the Brute,
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak’st,
Knew it not good for Man to be alone,
And no such companie as then thou saw’st
Intended thee, for trial onely brought,
To see how thou could’st judge of fit and meet:
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur’d,
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,
Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.

Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now
My earthly by his Heav’nly overpowerd,
Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth
In that celestial Colloquie sublime,
As with an object that excels the sense,
Dazl’d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call’d
By Nature as in aide, and clos’d mine eyes.
Mine eyes he clos’d, but op’n left the Cell
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape
Still glorious before whom awake I stood;
Who stooping op’nd my left side, and took
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,
But suddenly with flesh fill’d up & heal’d:
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;
Under his forming hands a Creature grew,
Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd
And in her looks, which from that time infus’d
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,
And into all things from her Aire inspir’d
The spirit of love and amorous delight.
She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak’d
To find her, or for ever to deplore
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable: On she came,
Led by her Heav’nly Maker, though unseen,
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:
Grace was in all her steps, Heav’n in her Eye,
In every gesture dignitie and love.
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.

This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill’d
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.

She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,
That would be woo’d, and not unsought be won,
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir’d,
The more desirable, or to say all,
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn’d;
I follow’d her, she what was Honour knew,
And with obsequious Majestie approv’d
My pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav’n,
And happie Constellations on that houre
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires
Whisper’d it to the Woods, and from thir wings
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr
On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.
Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought
My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find
In all things else delight indeed, but such
As us’d or not, works in the mind no change,
Nor vehement desire, these delicacies
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours,
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here
Farr otherwise, transported I behold,
Transported touch; here passion first I felt,
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else
Superiour and unmov’d, here onely weake
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part
Not proof enough such Object to sustain,
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps
More then enough; at least on her bestow’d
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew
Elaborate, of inward less exact.
For well I understand in the prime end
Of Nature her th’ inferiour, in the mind
And inward Faculties, which most excell,
In outward also her resembling less
His Image who made both, and less expressing
The character of that Dominion giv’n
O’re other Creatures; yet when I approach
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
And in her self compleat, so well to know
Her own, that what she wills to do or say,
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her
Looses discount’nanc’t, and like folly shewes;
Authoritie and Reason on her waite,
As one intended first, not after made
Occasionally; and to consummate all,
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
About her, as a guard Angelic plac’t.
To whom the Angel with contracted brow.

Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,
By attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav’st.
For what admir’st thou, what transports thee so,
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;
Then value: Oft times nothing profits more
Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right
Well manag’d; of that skill the more thou know’st,
The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,
And to realities yeild all her shows;
Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
So awful, that with honour thou maist love
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf’t
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be
To them made common & divulg’d, if aught
Therein enjoy’d were worthy to subdue
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.
What higher in her societie thou findst
Attractive, human, rational, love still;
In loving thou dost well, in passion not,
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale
By which to heav’nly Love thou maist ascend,
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.

To whom thus half abash’t _Adam_ repli’d.
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught
In procreation common to all kindes
(Though higher of the genial Bed by far,
And with mysterious reverence I deem)
So much delights me, as those graceful acts,
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions, mixt with Love
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign’d
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,
Who meet with various objects, from the sense
Variously representing; yet still free
Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
To love thou blam’st me not, for love thou saist
Leads up to Heav’n, is both the way and guide;
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;
Love not the heav’nly Spirits, and how thir Love
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?

To whom the Angel with a smile that glow’d
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,
Answer’d.  Let it suffice thee that thou know’st
Us happie, and without Love no happiness.
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy’st
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
In eminence, and obstacle find none
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:
Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure
Desiring; nor restrain’d conveyance need
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.
But I can now no more; the parting Sun
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
_Hesperean_ sets, my Signal to depart.
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep
His great command; take heed least Passion sway
Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons
The weal or woe in thee is plac’t; beware.
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.
Perfet within, no outward aid require;
And all temptation to transgress repel.

So saying, he arose; whom _Adam_ thus
Follow’d with benediction.  Since to part,
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension, and shall be honour’d ever
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still, and oft return.

So parted they, the Angel up to Heav’n
From the thick shade, and _Adam_ to his Bowre.

       THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK VIII.

No more of talk where God or Angel Guest
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us’d
To sit indulgent, and with him partake
Rural repast, permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblam’d: I now must change
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt
And disobedience: On the part of Heav’n
Now alienated, distance and distaste,
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv’n,
That brought into this World a world of woe,
Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument
Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth
Of stern _Achilles_ on his Foe pursu’d
Thrice Fugitive about _Troy_ Wall; or rage
Of _Turnus_ for _Lavinia_ disespous’d,
Or _Neptun’s_ ire or _Juno’s_, that so long
Perplex’d the _Greek_ and _Cytherea’s_ Son;
If answerable style I can obtaine
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes
Her nightly visitation unimplor’d,
And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires
Easie my unpremeditated Verse:
Since first this subject for Heroic Song
Pleas’d me long choosing, and beginning late;
Not sedulous by Nature to indite
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument
Heroic deem’d, chief maistrie to dissect
With long and tedious havoc fabl’d Knights
In Battels feign’d; the better fortitude
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
Or tilting Furniture, emblazon’d Shields,
Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights
At Joust and Torneament; then marshal’d Feast
Serv’d up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
Not that which justly gives Heroic name
To Person or to Poem.  Mee of these
Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument
Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise
That name, unless an age too late, or cold
Climat, or Years damp my intended wing
Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.

The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr
Of _Hesperus_, whose Office is to bring
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:
When _Satan_ who late fled before the threats
Of _Gabriel_ out of _Eden_, now improv’d
In meditated fraud and malice, bent
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself, fearless return’d.
By Night he fled, and at Midnight return’d
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
Since _Uriel_ Regent of the Sun descri’d
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv’n,
The space of seven continu’d Nights he rode
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
He circl’d, four times cross’d the Carr of Night
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
On the eighth return’d, and on the Coast averse
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,
Where _Tigris_ at the foot of Paradise
Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
In with the River sunk, and with it rose
Satan involv’d in rising Mist, then sought
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land
From _Eden_ over _Pontus_, and the Poole
_Maeotis_, up beyond the River _Ob_;
Downward as farr Antartic; and in length
West from _Orantes_ to the Ocean barr’d
At _Darien_, thence to the Land where flowes
_Ganges_ and _Indus:_ thus the Orb he roam’d
With narrow search; and with inspection deep
Consider’d every Creature, which of all
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.
Him after long debate, irresolute
Of thoughts revolv’d, his final sentence chose
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,
As from his wit and native suttletie
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ’d
Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow’r
Active within beyond the sense of brute.
Thus he resolv’d, but first from inward griefe
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour’d:

O Earth, how like to Heav’n, if not preferrd
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heav’n, danc’t round by other Heav’ns
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,
In thee concentring all thir precious beams
Of sacred influence: As God in Heav’n
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou
Centring receav’st from all those Orbs; in thee,
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth
Of Creatures animate with gradual life
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ’d up in Man.
With what delight could I have walkt thee round
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,
Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these
Find place or refuge; and the more I see
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
Of contraries; all good to me becomes
Bane, and in Heav’n much worse would be my state.
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav’n
To dwell, unless by maistring Heav’ns Supreame;
Nor hope to be my self less miserable
By what I seek, but others to make such
As I though thereby worse to me redound:
For onely in destroying I finde ease
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,
Or won to what may work his utter loss,
For whom all this was made, all this will soon
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,
In wo then; that destruction wide may range:
To mee shall be the glorie sole among
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr’d
What he _Almightie_ styl’d, six Nights and Days
Continu’d making, and who knows how long
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps
Not longer then since I in one Night freed
From servitude inglorious welnigh half
Th’ Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng
Of his adorers: hee to be aveng’d,
And to repaire his numbers thus impair’d,
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild
More Angels to Create, if they at least
Are his Created or to spite us more,
Determin’d to advance into our room
A Creature form’d of Earth, and him endow,
Exalted from so base original,
With Heav’nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed
He effected; Man he made, and for him built
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,
Him Lord pronounc’d, and, O indignitie!
Subjected to his service Angel wings,
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend
Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
O foul descent! that I who erst contended
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind
Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,
This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
That to the hight of Deitie aspir’d;
But what will not Ambition and Revenge
Descend to? who aspires must down as low
As high he soard, obnoxious first or last
To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,
Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim’d,
Since higher I fall short, on him who next
Provokes my envie, this new Favorite
Of Heav’n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,
Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais’d
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.

So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
His midnight search, where soonest he might finde
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl’d,
His head the midst, well stor’d with suttle wiles:
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,
In heart or head, possessing soon inspir’d
With act intelligential; but his sleep
Disturbd not, waiting close th’ approach of Morn.
Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne
In _Eden_ on the humid Flours, that breathd
Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,
From th’ Earths great Altar send up silent praise
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair
And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.
And _Eve_ first to her Husband thus began.

_Adam_, well may we labour still to dress
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.
Our pleasant task enjoyn’d, but till more hands
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise
Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct
The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:
For while so near each other thus all day
Our task we choose, what wonder if no near
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits
Our dayes work brought to little, though begun
Early, and th’ hour of Supper comes unearn’d.

To whom mild answer _Adam_ thus return’d.
Sole _Eve_, Associate sole, to me beyond
Compare above all living Creatures deare,
Well hast thou motion’d, wel thy thoughts imployd
How we might best fulfill the work which here
God hath assign’d us, nor of me shalt pass
Unprais’d: for nothing lovelier can be found
In woman, then to studie houshold good,
And good workes in her Husband to promote.
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos’d
Labour, as to debarr us when we need
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,
To brute deni’d, and are of Love the food,
Love not the lowest end of human life.
For not to irksom toile, but to delight
He made us, and delight to Reason joyn’d.
These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.
For solitude somtimes is best societie,
And short retirement urges sweet returne.
But other doubt possesses me, least harm
Befall thee sever’d from me; for thou knowst
What hath bin warn’d us, what malicious Foe
Envying our happiness, and of his own
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each
To other speedie aide might lend at need;
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss
Enjoy’d by us excites his envie more;
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.

To whom the Virgin Majestie of _Eve_,
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
With sweet austeer composure thus reply’d.

Ofspring of Heav’n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,
That such an enemie we have, who seeks
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,
And from the parting Angel over-heard
As in a shadie nook I stood behind,
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
To God or thee, because we have a foe
May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
His violence thou fearst not, being such,
As wee, not capable of death or paine,
Can either not receave, or can repell.
His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs
Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love
Can by his fraud be shak’n or seduc’t;
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,
_Adam_, misthought of her to thee so dear?

To whom with healing words _Adam_ reply’d.
Daughter of God and Man, immortal _Eve_,
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
Th’ attempt it self, intended by our Foe.
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos’d
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne
And anger wouldst resent the offer’d wrong,
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
If such affront I labour to avert
From thee alone, which on us both at once
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,
Or daring, first on mee th’ assault shall light.
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.
I from the influence of thy looks receave
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
Shame to be overcome or over-reacht
Would utmost vigor raise, and rais’d unite.
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
When I am present, and thy trial choose
With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri’d.

So spake domestick _Adam_ in his care
And Matrimonial Love, but _Eve_, who thought
Less attributed to her Faith sincere,
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.

If this be our condition, thus to dwell
In narrow circuit strait’nd by a Foe,
Suttle or violent, we not endu’d
Single with like defence, wherever met,
How are we happie, still in fear of harm?
But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme
Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns
Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard
By us? who rather double honour gaine
From his surmise prov’d false, finde peace within,
Favour from Heav’n, our witness from th’ event.
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid
Alone, without exterior help sustaind?
Let us not then suspect our happie State
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,
As not secure to single or combin’d.
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,
And _Eden_ were no _Eden_ thus expos’d.

To whom thus _Adam_ fervently repli’d.
O Woman, best are all things as the will
Of God ordaind them, his creating hand
Nothing imperfet or deficient left
Of all that he Created, much less Man,
Or ought that might his happie State secure,
Secure from outward force; within himself
The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
Against his will he can receave no harme.
But God left free the Will, for what obeyes
Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,
But bid her well beware, and still erect,
Least by some faire appeering good surpris’d
She dictate false, and missinforme the Will
To do what God expresly hath forbid.
Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,
That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the Foe subornd,
And fall into deception unaware,
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.
Seek not temptation then, which to avoide
Were better, and most likelie if from mee
Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.
Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve
First thy obedience; th’ other who can know,
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
But if thou think, trial unsought may finde
Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
Go in thy native innocence, relie
On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.

So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but _Eve_
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli’d.

With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,
May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar’d,
The willinger I goe, nor much expect
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light
_Oread_ or _Dryad_, or of _Delia’s_ Traine,
Betook her to the Groves, but _Delia’s_ self
In gate surpass’d and Goddess-like deport,
Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,
But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,
Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,
To _Pales_, or _Pomona_, thus adornd,
Likest she seemd, _Pomona_ when she fled
_Vertumnus_, or to _Ceres_ in her Prime,
Yet Virgin of _Proserpina_ from _Jove_.
Her long with ardent look his _Eye_ pursu’d
Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,
Repeated, shee to him as oft engag’d
To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.
O much deceav’d, much failing, hapless _Eve_,
Of thy presum’d return! event perverse!
Thou never from that houre in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose;
Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades
Waited with hellish rancor imminent
To intercept thy way, or send thee back
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them
The whole included Race, his purposd prey.
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet
He sought them both, but wish’d his hap might find
_Eve_ separate, he wish’d, but not with hope
Of what so seldom chanc’d, when to his wish,
Beyond his hope, _Eve_ separate he spies,
Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,
Half spi’d, so thick the Roses bushing round
About her glowd, oft stooping to support
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,
Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,
From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.
Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers’d
Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen
Among thick-wov’n Arborets and Flours
Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of _Eve_:
Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign’d
Or of reviv’d _Adonis_, or renownd
_Alcinous_, host of old _Laertes_ Son,
Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King
Held dalliance with his faire _Egyptian_ Spouse.
Much hee the Place admir’d, the Person more.
As one who long in populous City pent,
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,
She most, and in her look summs all Delight.
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of _Eve_
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav’nly forme
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,
Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire
Of gesture or lest action overawd
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav’d
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
That space the Evil one abstracted stood
From his own evil, and for the time remaind
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm’d,
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,
Though in mid Heav’n, soon ended his delight,
And tortures him now more, the more he sees
Of pleasure not for him ordain’d: then soon
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.

Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet
Compulsion thus transported to forget
What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,
Save what is in destroying, other joy
To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass
Occasion which now smiles, behold alone
The Woman, opportune to all attempts,
Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,
I not; so much hath Hell debas’d, and paine
Infeebl’d me, to what I was in Heav’n.
Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,
Not terrible, though terrour be in Love
And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,
Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign’d,
The way which to her ruin now I tend.

So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos’d
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward _Eve_
Address’d his way, not with indented wave,
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour’d
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
Lovelier, not those that in _Illyria_ chang’d
_Hermione_ and _Cadmus_, or the God
In _Epidaurus_; nor to which transformd
_Ammonian Jove_, or _Capitoline_ was seen,
Hee with _Olympias_, this with her who bore
_Scipio_ the highth of _Rome_.  With tract oblique
At first, as one who sought access, but feard
To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;
So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of _Eve_,
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us’d
To such disport before her through the Field,
From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
Then at _Circean_ call the Herd disguis’d.
Hee boulder now, uncall’d before her stood;
But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd
His turret Crest, and sleek enamel’d Neck,
Fawning, and lick’d the ground whereon she trod.
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length
The Eye of _Eve_ to mark his play; he glad
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,
His fraudulent temptation thus began.

Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm
Thy looks, the Heav’n of mildness, with disdain,
Displeas’d that I approach thee thus, and gaze
Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir’d.
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,
Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore
With ravishment beheld, there best beheld
Where universally admir’d; but here
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne
Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen
A Goddess among Gods, ador’d and serv’d
By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.

So gloz’d the Tempter, and his Proem tun’d;
Into the Heart of _Eve_ his words made way,
Though at the voice much marveling; at length
Not unamaz’d she thus in answer spake.
What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc’t
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?
The first at lest of these I thought deni’d
To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day
Created mute to all articulat sound;
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field
I knew, but not with human voice endu’d;
Redouble then this miracle, and say,
How cam’st thou speakable of mute, and how
To me so friendly grown above the rest
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
Say, for such wonder claims attention due.

To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply’d.
Empress of this fair World, resplendent _Eve_,
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:
I was at first as other Beasts that graze
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,
As was my food, nor aught but food discern’d
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:
Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc’d
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
When from the boughes a savorie odour blow’n,
Grateful to appetite, more pleas’d my sense
Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.
To satisfie the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv’d
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,
Powerful perswaders, quick’nd at the scent
Of that alluring fruit, urg’d me so keene.
About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,
For high from ground the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or _Adams_: Round the Tree
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
I spar’d not, for such pleasure till that hour
At Feed or Fountain never had I found.
Sated at length, ere long I might perceave
Strange alteration in me, to degree
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech
Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind
Considerd all things visible in Heav’n,
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;
But all that fair and good in thy Divine
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav’nly Ray
United I beheld; no Fair to thine
Equivalent or second, which compel’d
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come
And gaze, and worship thee of right declar’d
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.

So talk’d the spirited sly Snake; and _Eve_
Yet more amaz’d unwarie thus reply’d.

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov’d:
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?
For many are the Trees of God that grow
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
To us, in such abundance lies our choice,
As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,
Still hanging incorruptible, till men
Grow up to thir provision, and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.

To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.
Empress, the way is readie, and not long,
Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,
Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past
Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.

Lead then, said _Eve_.  Hee leading swiftly rowld
In tangles, and make intricate seem strait,
To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy
Bright’ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire
Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night
Condenses, and the cold invirons round,
Kindl’d through agitation to a Flame,
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,
Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,
Misleads th’ amaz’d Night-wanderer from his way
To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole,
There swallow’d up and lost, from succour farr.
So glister’d the dire Snake and into fraud
Led _Eve_ our credulous Mother, to the Tree
Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.

Serpent, we might have spar’d our coming hither,
Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,
The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,
Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.
But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;
God so commanded, and left that Command
Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.

To whom the Tempter guilefully repli’d.
Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit
Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,
Yet Lords declar’d of all in Earth or Aire?

To whom thus _Eve_ yet sinless.  Of the Fruit
Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,
But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst
The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate
Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.

She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold
The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love
To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
New part puts on, and as to passion mov’d,
Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act
Rais’d, as of som great matter to begin.
As when of old som Orator renound
In _Athens_ or free _Rome_, where Eloquence
Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,
Stood in himself collected, while each part,
Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,
Somtimes in highth began, as no delay
Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown
The Tempter all impassiond thus began.

O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life
To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,
Mee who have touch’d and tasted, yet both live,
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
Is open? or will God incense his ire
For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain
Of Death denounc’t, whatever thing Death be,
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:
Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,
His worshippers; he knows that in the day
Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then
Op’nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,
Internal Man, is but proportion meet,
I of brute human, yee of human Gods.
So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off
Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,
Though threat’nd, which no worse then this can bring
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they, participating God-like food?
The Gods are first, and that advantage use
On our belief, that all from them proceeds,
I question it, for this fair Earth I see,
Warm’d by the Sun, producing every kind,
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos’d
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
Th’ offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree
Impart against his will if all be his?
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell
In heav’nly brests? these, these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.

He ended, and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easie entrance won:
Fixt on the Fruit she gaz’d, which to behold
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn’d
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;
Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak’d
An eager appetite, rais’d by the smell
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first
Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus’d.

Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,
Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir’d,
Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:
Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,
Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding
Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good
By thee communicated, and our want:
For good unknown, sure is not had, or had
And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.
How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,
Irrational till then.  For us alone
Was death invented? or to us deni’d
This intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy
The good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.
What fear I then, rather what know to feare
Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,
That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for _Eve_
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true
Or fansied so, through expectation high
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.
Greedily she ingorg’d without restraint,
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,
And hight’nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,
Thus to her self she pleasingly began.

O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees
In Paradise, of operation blest
To Sapience, hitherto obscur’d, infam’d,
And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end
Created; but henceforth my early care,
Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise
Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease
Of thy full branches offer’d free to all;
Till dieted by thee I grow mature
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;
Though others envie what they cannot give;
For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here
Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,
Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind
In ignorance, thou op’nst Wisdoms way,
And giv’st access, though secret she retire.
And I perhaps am secret; Heav’n is high,
High and remote to see from thence distinct
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
May have diverted from continual watch
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies
About him.  But to _Adam_ in what sort
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known
As yet my change, and give him to partake
Full happiness with mee, or rather not,
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power
Without Copartner? so to add what wants
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,
And render me more equal, and perhaps
A thing not undesireable, somtime
Superior; for inferior who is free?
This may be well: but what if God have seen,
And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,
And _Adam_ wedded to another _Eve_,
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
A death to think.  Confirm’d then I resolve,
_Adam_ shall share with me in bliss or woe:
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
I could endure; without him live no life.

So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,
But first low Reverence don, as to the power
That dwelt within, whose presence had infus’d
Into the plant sciential sap, deriv’d
From Nectar, drink of Gods.  _Adam_ the while
Waiting desirous her return, had wove
Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne
Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown
As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.
Great joy he promis’d to his thoughts, and new
Solace in her return, so long delay’d;
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;
And forth to meet her went, the way she took
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil’d,
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus’d.
To him she hasted, in her face excuse
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,
Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.

Hast thou not wonderd, _Adam_, at my stay?
Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv’d
Thy presence, agonie of love till now
Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more
Mean I to trie, what rash untri’d I sought,
The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
Op’ning the way, but of Divine effect
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,
Hath eat’n of the fruit, and is become,
Not dead, as we are threatn’d, but thenceforth
Endu’d with human voice and human sense,
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I
Have also tasted, and have also found
Th’ effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,
Tedious, unshar’d with thee, and odious soon.
Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot
May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;
Least thou not tasting, different degree
Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce
Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.

Thus _Eve_ with Countnance blithe her storie told;
But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.
On th’ other side, _Adam_, soon as he heard
The fatal Trespass don by _Eve_, amaz’d,
Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill
Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax’d;
From his slack hand the Garland wreath’d for _Eve_
Down drop’d, and all the faded Roses shed:
Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
First to himself he inward silence broke.

O fairest of Creation, last and best
Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell’d
Whatever can to fight or thought be found,
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,
Defac’t, deflourd, and now to Death devote?
Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
The strict forbiddance, how to violate
The sacred Fruit forbidd’n! som cursed fraud
Of Enemie hath beguil’d thee, yet unknown,
And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee
Certain my resolution is to Die;
How can I live without thee, how forgoe
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn’d,
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?
Should God create another _Eve_, and I
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.

So having said, as one from sad dismay
Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd
Submitting to what seemd remediless,
Thus in calme mood his Words to _Eve_ he turnd.

Bold deed thou hast presum’d, adventrous _Eve_,
And peril great provok’t, who thus hast dar’d
Had it bin onely coveting to Eye
That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,
Much more to taste it under banne to touch.
But past who can recall, or don undoe?
Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact
Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,
Profan’d first by the Serpent, by him first
Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;
Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,
Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man
Higher degree of Life, inducement strong
To us, as likely tasting to attaine
Proportional ascent, which cannot be
But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime Creatures, dignifi’d so high,
Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,
For us created, needs with us must faile,
Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,
Not well conceav’d of God, who though his Power
Creation could repeate, yet would be loath
Us to abolish, least the Adversary
Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God
Most Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first
He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?
Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.
However I with thee have fixt my Lot,
Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death
Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;
So forcible within my heart I feel
The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
Our State cannot be severd, we are one,
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.

So _Adam_, and thus _Eve_ to him repli’d.
O glorious trial of exceeding Love,
Illustrious evidence, example high!
Ingaging me to emulate, but short
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,
_Adam_, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,
Direct, or by occasion hath presented
This happie trial of thy Love, which else
So eminently never had bin known.
Were it I thought Death menac’t would ensue
This my attempt, I would sustain alone
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur’d
Remarkably so late of thy so true,
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel
Farr otherwise th’ event, not Death, but Life
Augmented, op’nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
On my experience, _Adam_, freely taste,
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.

So saying, she embrac’d him, and for joy
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love
Had so enobl’d, as of choice to incurr
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.
In recompence (for such compliance bad
Such recompence best merits) from the bough
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit
With liberal hand: he scrupl’d not to eat
Against his better knowledge, not deceav’d,
But fondly overcome with Femal charm.
Earth trembl’d from her entrails, as again
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,
Skie lowr’d, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin
Original; while _Adam_ took no thought,
Eating his fill, nor _Eve_ to iterate
Her former trespass fear’d, the more to soothe
Him with her lov’d societie, that now
As with new Wine intoxicated both
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel
Divinitie within them breeding wings
Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit
Farr other operation first displaid,
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on _Eve_
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:
Till _Adam_ thus ’gan _Eve_ to dalliance move.

_Eve_, now I see thou art exact of taste,
And elegant, of Sapience no small part,
Since to each meaning savour we apply,
And Palate call judicious; I the praise
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey’d.
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain’d
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now
True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
In things to us forbidden, it might be wish’d,
For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.
But come, so well refresh’t, now let us play,
As meet is, after such delicious Fare;
For never did thy Beautie since the day
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn’d
With all perfections, so enflame my sense
With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now
Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.

So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
Of amorous intent, well understood
Of _Eve_, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.
Her hand he seis’d, and to a shadie bank,
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr’d
He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,
Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,
And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.
There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport
Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,
The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep
Oppress’d them, wearied with thir amorous play.
Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,
That with exhilerating vapour bland
About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers
Made erre, was now exhal’d, and grosser sleep
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose
As from unrest, and each the other viewing,
Soon found thir Eyes how op’nd, and thir minds
How dark’nd; innocence, that as a veile
Had shadow’d them from knowing ill, was gon,
Just confidence, and native righteousness,
And honour from about them, naked left
To guiltie shame hee cover’d, but his Robe
Uncover’d more.  So rose the _Danite_ strong
_Herculean Samson_ from the Harlot-lap
Of _Philistean Dalilah_, and wak’d
Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare
Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face
Confounded long they sate, as struck’n mute,
Till _Adam_, though not less then _Eve_ abasht,
At length gave utterance to these words constraind.

O _Eve_, in evil hour thou didst give care
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught
To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,
False in our promis’d Rising; since our Eyes
Op’nd we find indeed, and find we know
Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,
Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,
Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,
Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,
And in our Faces evident the signes
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face
Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy
And rapture so oft beheld? those heav’nly shapes
Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze
Insufferably bright.  O might I here
In solitude live savage, in some glad
Obscur’d, where highest Woods impenetrable
To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,
And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
Hide me, where I may never see them more.
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
What best may for the present serve to hide
The Parts of each from other, that seem most
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,
And girded on our loyns, may cover round
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.

So counsel’d hee, and both together went
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown’d,
But such as at this day to _Indians_ known
In _Malabar_ or _Decan_ spreds her Armes
Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade
High overarch’t, and echoing Walks between;
There oft the _Indian_ Herdsman shunning heate
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves
They gatherd, broad as _Amazonian_ Targe,
And with what skill they had, together sowd,
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike
To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late
_Columbus_ found th’ _American_ to girt
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.
Thus fenc’t, and as they thought, thir shame in part
Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,
They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares
Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within
Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,
Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore
Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once
And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:
For Understanding rul’d not, and the Will
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now
To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe
Usurping over sovran Reason claimd
Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,
_Adam_, estrang’d in look and alterd stile,
Speech intermitted thus to _Eve_ renewd.

Would thou hadst heark’nd to my words, & stai’d
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild
Of all our good, sham’d, naked, miserable.
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.

To whom soon mov’d with touch of blame thus _Eve_.
What words have past thy Lips, _Adam_ severe,
Imput’st thou that to my default, or will
Of wandering, as thou call’st it, which who knows
But might as ill have happ’nd thou being by,
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,
Or bere th’ attempt, thou couldst not have discernd
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
No ground of enmitie between us known,
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.
Was I to have never parted from thy side?
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head
Command me absolutely not to go,
Going into such danger as thou saidst?
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,
Neither had I transgress’d, nor thou with mee.

To whom then first incenst _Adam_ repli’d.
Is this the Love, is the recompence
Of mine to thee, ingrateful _Eve_, exprest
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,
Who might have liv’d and joyd immortal bliss,
Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:
And am I now upbraided, as the cause
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?
I warn’d thee, I admonish’d thee, foretold
The danger, and the lurking Enemie
That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,
And force upon free Will hath here no place.
But confidence then bore thee on, secure
Either to meet no danger, or to finde
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps
I also err’d in overmuch admiring
What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought
No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue
That errour now, which is become my crime,
And thou th’ accuser.  Thus it shall befall
Him who to worth in Women overtrusting
Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,
And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,
Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.

Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning
And of thir vain contest appeer’d no end.

       THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK IX.

Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act
Of _Satan_ done in Paradise, and how
Hee in the Serpent had perverted _Eve_,
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,
Was known in Heav’n; for what can scape the Eye
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,
Hinder’d not _Satan_ to attempt the minde
Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm’d,
Complete to have discover’d and repulst
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.
For still they knew, and ought to have still remember’d
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
Incurr’d, what could they less, the penaltie,
And manifold in sin, deserv’d to fall.
Up into Heav’n from Paradise in hast
Th’ Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad
For Man, for of his state by this they knew,
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln
Entrance unseen.  Soon as th’ unwelcome news
From Earth arriv’d at Heaven Gate, displeas’d
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt
With pitie, violated not thir bliss.
About the new-arriv’d, in multitudes
Th’ ethereal People ran, to hear and know
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream
Accountable made haste to make appear
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,
And easily approv’d; when the most High
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,
Amidst in Thunder utter’d thus his voice.

Assembl’d Angels, and ye Powers return’d
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,
Nor troubl’d at these tidings from the Earth,
Which your sincerest care could not prevent,
Foretold so lately what would come to pass,
When first this Tempter cross’d the Gulf from Hell.
I told ye then he should prevail and speed
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc’t
And flatter’d out of all, believing lies
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine
Concurring to necessitate his Fall,
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
His free Will, to her own inclining left
In eevn scale.  But fall’n he is, and now
What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass
On his transgression, Death denounc’t that day,
Which he presumes already vain and void,
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear’d,
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn’d.
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr’d
All Judgement, whether in Heav’n, or Earth; or Hell.
Easie it may be seen that I intend
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design’d
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,
And destin’d Man himself to judge Man fall’n.

So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son
Blaz’d forth unclouded Deitie; he full
Resplendent all his Father manifest
Express’d, and thus divinely answer’d milde.

Father Eternal, thine is to decree,
Mine both in Heav’n and Earth to do thy will
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov’d
Mayst ever rest well pleas’d.  I go to judge
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,
Whoever judg’d, the worst on mee must light,
When time shall be, for so I undertook
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom
On me deriv’d, yet I shall temper so
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none
Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg’d,
Those two; the third best absent is condemn’d,
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.

Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence
_Eden_ and all the Coast in prospect lay.
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing’d.
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour
To fan the Earth now wak’d, and usher in
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin’d, they heard
And from his presence hid themselves among
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God
Approaching, thus to _Adam_ call’d aloud.

Where art thou _Adam_, wont with joy to meet
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,
Not pleas’d, thus entertaind with solitude,
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear’d unsaught:
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change
Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.
He came, and with him _Eve_, more loth, though first
To offend, discount’nanc’t both, and discompos’d;
Love was not in thir looks, either to God
Or to each other, but apparent guilt,
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.
Whence _Adam_ faultring long, thus answer’d brief.

I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice
Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom
The gracious Judge without revile repli’d.

My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear’d,
But still rejoyc’t, how is it now become
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?

To whom thus _Adam_ sore beset repli’d.
O Heav’n! in evil strait this day I stand
Before my Judge, either to undergoe
My self the total Crime, or to accuse
My other self, the partner of my life;
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,
I should conceal, and not expose to blame
By my complaint; but strict necessitie
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,
Least on my head both sin and punishment,
However insupportable, be all
Devolv’d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.
This Woman whom thou mad’st to be my help,
And gav’st me as thy perfet gift, so good,
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,
That from her hand I could suspect no ill,
And what she did, whatever in it self,
Her doing seem’d to justifie the deed;
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.

To whom the sovran Presence thus repli’d.
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,
Superior, or but equal, that to her
Thou did’st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell’d
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd
She was indeed, and lovely to attract
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts
Were such as under Government well seem’d,
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part
And person, had’st thou known thy self aright.

So having said, he thus to _Eve_ in few:
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?

To whom sad _Eve_ with shame nigh overwhelm’d,
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli’d.

The Serpent me beguil’d and I did eate.

Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
To Judgement he proceeded on th’ accus’d
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre
The Guilt on him who made him instrument
Of mischief, and polluted from the end
Of his Creation; justly then accurst,
As vitiated in Nature: more to know
Concern’d not Man (since he no further knew)
Nor alter’d his offence; yet God at last
To Satan first in sin his doom apply’d,
Though in mysterious terms, judg’d as then best:
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.

Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst
Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.
Between Thee and the Woman I will put
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;
Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.

So spake this Oracle, then verifi’d
When _Jesus_ son of _Mary_ second _Eve_,
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav’n,
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht
In open shew, and with ascention bright
Captivity led captive through the Aire,
The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn’d.

Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.

On _Adam_ last thus judgement he pronounc’d.
Because thou hast heark’nd to the voice of thy Wife,
And eaten of the Tree concerning which
I charg’d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,
Curs’d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;
Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th’ Herb of th’ Field,
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.

 So judg’d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,
And th’ instant stroke of Death denounc’t that day
Remov’d farr off; then pittying how they stood
Before him naked to the aire, that now
Must suffer change, disdain’d not to begin
Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,
As when he wash’d his servants feet, so now
As Father of his Familie he clad
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,
Araying cover’d from his Fathers sight.
To him with swift ascent he up returnd,
Into his blissful bosom reassum’d
In glory as of old, to him appeas’d
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
Meanwhile ere thus was sin’d and judg’d on Earth,
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,
In counterview within the Gates, that now
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
Farr into _Chaos_, since the Fiend pass’d through,
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.

O Son, why sit we here each other viewing
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides
For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be
But that success attends him; if mishap,
Ere this he had return’d, with fury driv’n
By his Avenger, since no place like this
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
Wings growing, and Dominion giv’n me large
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,
Or sympathie, or som connatural force
Powerful at greatest distance to unite
With secret amity things of like kinde
By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade
Inseparable must with mee along:
For Death from Sin no power can separate.
But least the difficultie of passing back
Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe
Impassable, impervious, let us try
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine
Not unagreeable, to found a path
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument
Of merit high to all th’ infernal Host,
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,
Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
By this new felt attraction and instinct.

Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.
Goe whither Fate and inclination strong
Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
The savour of Death from all things there that live:
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.

So saying, with delight he snuff’d the smell
Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,
Against the day of Battel, to a Field,
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur’d
With sent of living Carcasses design’d
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn’d
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,
Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste
Wide Anarchie of _Chaos_ damp and dark
Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea
Tost up and down, together crowded drove
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse
Upon the _Cronian_ Sea, together drive
Mountains of Ice, that stop th’ imagin’d way
Beyond _Petsora_ Eastward, to the rich
_Cathaian_ Coast.  The aggregated Soyle
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,
As with a Trident smote, and fix’t as firm
As _Delos_ floating once; the rest his look
Bound with _Gorgonian_ rigor not to move,
And with _Asphaltic_ slime; broad as the Gate,
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather’d beach
They fasten’d, and the Mole immense wraught on
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall
Immoveable of this now fenceless world
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.
So, if great things to small may be compar’d,
_Xerxes_, the Libertie of _Greece_ to yoke,
From _Susa_ his _Memnonian_ Palace high
Came to the Sea, and over _Hellespont_
Bridging his way, _Europe_ with _Asia_ joyn’d,
And scourg’d with many a stroak th’ indignant waves.
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock
Over the vext Abyss, following the track
Of _Satan_, to the selfsame place where hee
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe
From out of _Chaos_ to the outside bare
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made
And durable; and now in little space
The Confines met of Empyrean Heav’n
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interpos’d; three sev’ral wayes
In sight, to each of these three places led.
And now thir way to Earth they had descri’d,
To Paradise first tending, when behold
_Satan_ in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the _Centaure_ and the _Scorpion_ stearing
His _Zenith_, while the Sun in _Aries_ rose:
Disguis’d he came, but those his Children dear
Thir Parent soon discern’d, though in disguise.
Hee, after _Eve_ seduc’t, unminded slunk
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
By _Eve_, though all unweeting, seconded
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them, terrifi’d
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth
Might suddenly inflict; that past, return’d
By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood
Not instant, but of future time.  With joy
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return’d,
And at the brink of _Chaos_, neer the foot
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop’t
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas’d.
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.

O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,
Thy Trophies, which thou view’st as not thine own,
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:
For I no sooner in my Heart divin’d,
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie
Still moves with thine, joyn’d in connexion sweet,
That thou on Earth hadst prosper’d, which thy looks
Now also evidence, but straight I felt
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt
That I must after thee with this thy Son;
Such fatal consequence unites us three:
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track.
Thou hast atchiev’d our libertie, confin’d
Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow’rd
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain’d
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng’d
Our foile in Heav’n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,
As Battel hath adjudg’d, from this new World
Retiring, by his own doom alienated,
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide
Of all things, parted by th’ Empyreal bounds,
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,
Or trie thee now more dang’rous to his Throne.

Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,
High proof ye now have giv’n to be the Race
Of _Satan_ (for I glorie in the name,
Antagonist of Heav’ns Almightie King)
Amply have merited of me, of all
Th’ Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav’ns dore
Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm
Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent
Of easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
With these successes, and with them rejoyce,
You two this way, among those numerous Orbs
All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth
Dominion exercise and in the Aire,
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar’d,
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might
Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,
Through Sin to Death expos’d by my exploit.
If your joynt power prevaile, th’ affaires of Hell
No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.

So saying he dismiss’d them, they with speed
Thir course through thickest Constellations held
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips
Then sufferd.  Th’ other way _Satan_ went down
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side
Disparted _Chaos_ over built exclaimd,
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,
That scorn’d his indignation: through the Gate,
Wide open and unguarded, _Satan_ pass’d,
And all about found desolate; for those
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all
Farr to the inland retir’d, about the walls
Of _Pandemonium_, Citie and proud seate
Of _Lucifer_, so by allusion calld,
Of that bright Starr to _Satan_ paragond.
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance
Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee
Departing gave command, and they observ’d.
As when the _Tartar_ from his _Russian_ Foe
By _Astracan_ over the Snowie Plaines
Retires, or _Bactrian_ Sophi from the hornes
Of _Turkish_ Crescent, leaves all waste beyond
The Realme of _Aladule_, in his retreate
To _Tauris_ or _Casbeen_.  So these the late
Heav’n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell
Many a dark League, reduc’t in careful Watch
Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer from the search
Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,
In shew plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order, past; and from the dore
Of that _Plutonian_ Hall, invisible
Ascended his high Throne, which under state
Of richest texture spred, at th’ upper end
Was plac’t in regal lustre.  Down a while
He sate, and round about him saw unseen:
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head
And shape Starr bright appeer’d, or brighter, clad
With what permissive glory since his fall
Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz’d
At that so sudden blaze the _Stygian_ throng
Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish’d beheld,
Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th’ acclaime:
Forth rush’d in haste the great consulting Peers,
Rais’d from thir dark _Divan_, and with like joy
Congratulant approach’d him, who with hand
Silence, and with these words attention won.

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
For in possession such, not onely of right,
I call ye and declare ye now, returnd
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit
Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,
And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,
As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven
Little inferiour, by my adventure hard
With peril great atchiev’d.  Long were to tell
What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine
Voyag’d the unreal, vast, unbounded deep
Of horrible confusion, over which
By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav’d
To expedite your glorious march; but I
Toild out my uncouth passage, forc’t to ride
Th’ untractable Abysse, plung’d in the womb
Of unoriginal _Night_ and _Chaos_ wilde,
That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos’d
My journey strange, with clamorous uproare
Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found
The new created World, which fame in Heav’n
Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful
Of absolute perfection, therein Man
Plac’t in a Paradise, by our exile
Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc’d
From his Creator, and the more to increase
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat
Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv’n up
Both his beloved Man and all his World,
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
Without our hazard, labour or allarme,
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
To rule, as over all he should have rul’d.
True is, mee also he hath judg’d, or rather
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape
Man I deceav’d: that which to mee belongs,
Is enmity, which he will put between
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
A World who would not purchase with a bruise,
Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th’ account
Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,
But up and enter now into full bliss.

So having said, a while he stood, expecting
Thir universal shout and high applause
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears
On all sides, from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss, the sound
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining
Each other, till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power
Now rul’d him, punisht in the shape he sin’d,
According to his doom: he would have spoke,
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue
To forked tongue, for now were all transform’d
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now
With complicated monsters, head and taile,
Scorpion and Asp, and _Amphisbaena_ dire,
_Cerastes_ hornd, _Hydrus_, and _Ellops_ drear,
And _Dipsas_ (Not so thick swarm’d once the Soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle
_Ophiusa_) but still greatest hee the midst,
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun
Ingenderd in the _Pythian_ Vale on slime,
Huge _Python_, and his Power no less he seem’d
Above the rest still to retain; they all
Him follow’d issuing forth to th’ open Field,
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout
Heav’n-fall’n, in station stood or just array,
Sublime with expectation when to see
In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,
And the dire hiss renew’d, and the dire form
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,
As in thir crime.  Thus was th’ applause they meant,
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,
His will who reigns above, to aggravate
Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that
VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of _Eve_
Us’d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
Thir earnest eyes they fix’d, imagining
For one forbidden Tree a multitude
Now ris’n, to work them furder woe or shame;
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks
That curld _Megaera_: greedily they pluck’d
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew
Neer that bituminous Lake where _Sodom_ flam’d;
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
Deceav’d; they fondly thinking to allay
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th’ offended taste
VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,
VVith hatefullest disrelish writh’d thir jaws
VVith foot and cinders fill’d; so oft they fell
Into the same illusion, not as Man
Whom they triumph’d once lapst.  Thus were they plagu’d
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum’d,
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo
This annual humbling certain number’d days,
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc’t.
However some tradition they dispers’d
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,
And Fabl’d how the Serpent, whom they calld
_Ophion_ with _Eurynome_, the wide-
Encroaching _Eve_ perhaps, had first the rule
Of high _Olympus_, thence by _Saturn_ driv’n
And _Ops_, ere yet _Dictaean_ _Jove_ was born.
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arriv’d, _Sin_ there in power before,
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell
Habitual habitant; behind her _Death_
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
On his pale Horse: to whom _Sin_ thus began.

Second of _Satan_ sprung, all conquering Death,
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd
With travail difficult, not better farr
Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,
Unnam’d, undreaded, and thy self half starv’d?

Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,
There best, where most with ravin I may meet;
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.

To whom th’ incestuous Mother thus repli’d.
Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,
No homely morsels, and whatever thing
The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar’d,
Till I in Man residing through the Race,
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,
And season him thy last and sweetest prey.

This said, they both betook them several wayes,
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
All kinds, and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later; which th’ Almightie seeing,
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,
To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.

See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I
So fair and good created, and had still
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man
Let in these wastful Furies, who impute
Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell
And his Adherents, that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heav’nly, and conniving seem
To gratifie my scornful Enemies,
That laugh, as if transported with some fit
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,
At random yeilded up to their misrule;
And know not that I call’d and drew them thither
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure, till cramm’d and gorg’d, nigh burst
With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,
Both _Sin_, and _Death_, and yawning _Grave_ at last
Through _Chaos_ hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.
Then Heav’n and Earth renewd shall be made pure
To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:
Till then the Curse pronounc’t on both precedes.

Hee ended, and the heav’nly Audience loud
Sung _Halleluia_, as the sound of Seas,
Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,
Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;
Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,
Destin’d restorer of Mankind, by whom
New Heav’n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,
Or down from Heav’n descend.  Such was thir song,
While the Creator calling forth by name
His mightie Angels gave them several charge,
As sorted best with present things.  The Sun
Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring
Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone
Her office they prescrib’d, to th’ other five
Thir planetarie motions and aspects
In _Sextile_, _Square_, and _Trine_, and _Opposite_,
Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne
In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt
Thir influence malignant when to showre,
Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,
Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set
Thir corners, when with bluster to confound
Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle
With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.
Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse
The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
From the Suns Axle; they with labour push’d
Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun
Was bid turn Reines from th’ Equinoctial Rode
Like distant breadth to _Taurus_ with the Seav’n
_Atlantick_ Sisters, and the _Spartan_ Twins
Up to the _Tropic_ Crab; thence down amaine
By _Leo_ and the _Virgin_ and the _Scales_,
As deep as _Capricorne_, to bring in change
Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring
Perpetual smil’d on Earth with vernant Flours,
Equal in Days and Nights, except to those
Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun
To recompence his distance, in thir sight
Had rounded still th’ _Horizon_, and not known
Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow
From cold _Estotiland_, and South as farr
Beneath _Magellan_.  At that tasted Fruit
The Sun, as from _Thyestean_ Banquet, turn’d
His course intended; else how had the World
Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?
These changes in the Heav’ns, though slow, produc’d
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North
Of _Norumbega_, and the _Samoed_ shoar
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,
_Boreas_ and _Caecias_ and _Argestes_ loud
And _Thrascias_ rend the Woods and Seas upturn;
With adverse blast up-turns them from the South
_Notus_ and _Afer_ black with thundrous Clouds
From _Serraliona_; thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the _Levant_ and the _Ponent_ VVindes
_Eurus_ and _Zephir_ with thir lateral noise,
_Sirocco_, and _Libecchio_. Thus began
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first
Daughter of Sin, among th’ irrational,
Death introduc’d through fierce antipathie:
Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe
Of Man, but fled him, or with count’nance grim
Glar’d on him passing: these were from without
The growing miseries, which _Adam_ saw
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,
And in a troubl’d Sea of passion tost,
Thus to disburd’n sought with sad complaint.

O miserable of happie! is this the end
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end
The miserie, I deserv’d it, and would beare
My own deservings; but this will not serve;
All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,
Is propagated curse.  O voice once heard
Delightfully, _Encrease and Multiply_,
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease
Or multiplie, but curses on my head?
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling
The evil on him brought by me, will curse
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,
For this we may thank _Adam_; but his thanks
Shall be the execration; so besides
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,
On mee as on thir natural center light
Heavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes
Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!
Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay
To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee
From darkness to promote me, or here place
In this delicious Garden? as my Will
Concurd not to my being, it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust,
Desirous to resigne, and render back
All I receav’d, unable to performe
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold
The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable
Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,
I thus contest; then should have been refusd
Those terms whatever, when they were propos’d:
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,
Then cavil the conditions? and though God
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son
Prove disobedient, and reprov’d, retort,
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,
But Natural necessity begot.
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes
His hand to execute what his Decree
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,
Why am I mockt with death, and length’nd out
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth
Insensible, how glad would lay me down
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me
With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man
Which God inspir’d, cannot together perish
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,
Or in some other dismal place, who knows
But I shall die a living Death?  O thought
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath
Of Life that sinn’d; what dies but what had life
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.
All of me then shall die: let this appease
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.
For though the Lord of all be infinite,
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,
But mortal doom’d.  How can he exercise
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make
Strange contradiction, which to God himself
Impossible is held, as Argument
Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,
For angers sake, finite to infinite
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour
Satisfi’d never; that were to extend
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,
By which all Causes else according still
To the reception of thir matter act,
Not to th’ extent of thir own Spheare.  But say
That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos’d,
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie
From this day onward, which I feel begun
Both in me, and without me, and so last
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
On my defensless head; both Death and I
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,
Nor I on my part single, in mee all
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!
So disinherited how would ye bless
Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn’d,
If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d,
Not to do onely, but to will the same
With me? how can they acquitted stand
In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes
Forc’t I absolve: all my evasions vain
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still
But to my own conviction: first and last
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;
So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,
Then all the world much heavier, though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir’st,
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future,
To _Satan_ onely like both crime and doom.
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears
And horrors hast thou driv’n me; out of which
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung’d!

Thus _Adam_ to himself lamented loud
Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,
Which to his evil Conscience represented
All things with double terror: On the ground
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft
Curs’d his Creation, Death as oft accus’d
Of tardie execution, since denounc’t
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
Justice Divine not hast’n to be just?
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,
VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades
To answer, and resound farr other Song.
VVhom thus afflicted when sad _Eve_ beheld,
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay’d:
But her with stern regard he thus repell’d.

Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best
Befits thee with him leagu’d, thy self as false
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee
Henceforth; least that too heav’nly form, pretended
To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain’d
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting
Fool’d and beguil’d, by him thou, I by thee,
To trust thee from my side, imagin’d wise,
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,
And understood not all was but a shew
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
More to the part sinister from me drawn,
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie
To my just number found.  O why did God,
Creator wise, that peopl’d highest Heav’n
With Spirits Masculine, create at last
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once
With Men as Angels without Feminine,
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind? this mischief had not then befall’n,
And more that shall befall, innumerable
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:
Which infinite calamitie shall cause
To humane life, and houshold peace confound.

He added not, and from her turn’d, but _Eve_
Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas’d not flowing,
And tresses all disorderd, at his feet
Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.

Forsake me not thus, _Adam_, witness Heav’n
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,
Unhappilie deceav’d; thy suppliant
I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,
My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,
Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,
As joyn’d in injuries, one enmitie
Against a Foe by doom express assign’d us,
That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not
Thy hatred for this miserie befall’n,
On me already lost, mee then thy self
More miserable; both have sin’d, but thou
Against God onely, I against God and thee,
And to the place of judgement will return,
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all
The sentence from thy head remov’d may light
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,
Mee mee onely just object of his ire.

She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,
Immoveable till peace obtain’d from fault
Acknowledg’d and deplor’d, in _Adam_ wraught
Commiseration; soon his heart relented
Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,
Now at his feet submissive in distress,
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,
His counsel whom she had displeas’d, his aide;
As one disarm’d, his anger all he lost,
And thus with peaceful words uprais’d her soon.

Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,
So now of what thou knowst not, who desir’st
The punishment all on thy self; alas,
Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine
His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,
And my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,
That on my head all might be visited,
Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv’n,
To me committed and by me expos’d.
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame
Each other, blam’d enough elsewhere, but strive
In offices of Love, how we may light’n
Each others burden in our share of woe;
Since this days Death denounc’t, if ought I see,
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac’t evill,
A long days dying to augment our paine,
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv’d.

To whom thus _Eve_, recovering heart, repli’d.
_Adam_, by sad experiment I know
How little weight my words with thee can finde,
Found so erroneous, thence by just event
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,
Restor’d by thee, vile as I am, to place
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,
Living or dying from thee I will not hide
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris’n,
Tending to som relief of our extremes,
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,
As in our evils, and of easier choice.
If care of our descent perplex us most,
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd
By Death at last, and miserable it is
To be to others cause of misery,
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring
Into this cursed World a woful Race,
That after wretched Life must be at last
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
Childless thou art, Childless remaine:
So Death shall be deceav’d his glut, and with us two
Be forc’d to satisfie his Rav’nous Maw.
But if thou judge it hard and difficult,
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,
And with desire to languish without hope,
Before the present object languishing
With like desire, which would be miserie
And torment less then none of what we dread,
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free
From what we fear for both, let us make short,
Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply
With our own hands his Office on our selves;
Why stand we longer shivering under feares,
That shew no end but Death, and have the power,
Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,
Destruction with destruction to destroy.

She ended heer, or vehement despaire
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts
Had entertaind, as di’d her Cheeks with pale.
But _Adam_ with such counsel nothing sway’d,
To better hopes his more attentive minde
Labouring had rais’d, and thus to _Eve_ repli’d.

_Eve_, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
To argue in thee somthing more sublime
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes
That excellence thought in thee, and implies,
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret
For loss of life and pleasure overlov’d.
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end
Of miserie, so thinking to evade
The penaltie pronounc’t, doubt not but God
Hath wiselier arm’d his vengeful ire then so
To be forestall’d; much more I fear least Death
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts
Of contumacie will provoke the highest
To make death in us live: Then let us seek
Som safer resolution, which methinks
I have in view, calling to minde with heed
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe
_Satan_, who in the Serpent hath contriv’d
Against us this deceit: to crush his head
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost
By death brought on our selves, or childless days
Resolv’d, as thou proposest; so our Foe
Shall scape his punishment ordain’d, and wee
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
No more be mention’d then of violence
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,
Reluctance against God and his just yoke
Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild
And gracious temper he both heard and judg’d
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected
Immediate dissolution, which we thought
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,
And bringing forth, soon recompenc’t with joy,
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope
Glanc’d on the ground, with labour I must earne
My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands
Cloath’d us unworthie, pitying while he judg’d;
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,
And teach us further by what means to shun
Th’ inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,
Which now the Skie with various Face begins
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish
Our Limbs benumm’d, ere this diurnal Starr
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather’d beams
Reflected, may with matter sere foment,
Or by collision of two bodies grinde
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv’n down
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,
And sends a comfortable heat from farr,
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,
And what may else be remedie or cure
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear
To pass commodiously this life, sustain’d
By him with many comforts, till we end
In dust, our final rest and native home.
What better can we do, then to the place
Repairing where he judg’d us, prostrate fall
Before him reverent, and there confess
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears
VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn
From his displeasure; in whose look serene,
VVhen angry most he seem’d and most severe,
VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?

So spake our Father penitent, nor _Eve_
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place
Repairing where he judg’d them prostrate fell
Before him reverent, and both confess’d
Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg’d, with tears
VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.

       THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST.





  BOOK X.

Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
Prevenient Grace descending had remov’d
The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh
Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath’d
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
Inspir’d, and wing’d for Heav’n with speedier flight
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port
Not of mean suiters, nor important less
Seem’d thir Petition, then when th’ ancient Pair
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
_Deucalion_ and chaste _Pyrrha_ to restore
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine
Of _Themis_ stood devout.  To Heav’n thir prayers
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes
Blow’n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd
Dimentionless through Heav’nly dores; then clad
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum’d,
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
Presenting, thus to intercede began.

See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
Sow’n with contrition in his heart, then those
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees
Of Paradise could have produc’t, ere fall’n
From innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;
Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate
And propitiation, all his works on mee
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.
Accept me, and in mee from these receave
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live
Before thee reconcil’d, at least his days
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,
Made one with me as I with thee am one.

To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:
But longer in that Paradise to dwell,
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:
Those pure immortal Elements that know
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,
And mortal food, as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt
Corrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts
Created him endowd, with Happiness
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,
This other serv’d but to eternize woe;
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes
His final remedie, and after Life
Tri’d in sharp tribulation, and refin’d
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,
Wak’t in the renovation of the just,
Resignes him up with Heav’n and Earth renewd.
But let us call to Synod all the Blest
Through Heav’ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide
My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,
As how with peccant Angels late they saw;
And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.

He ended, and the Son gave signal high
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew
His Trumpet, heard in _Oreb_ since perhaps
When God descended, and perhaps once more
To sound at general Doom.  Th’ Angelic blast
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs
Of _Amarantin_ Shade, Fountain or Spring,
By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream
Th’ Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.

O Sons, like one of us Man is become
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,
Happier, had it suffic’d him to have known
Good by it self, and Evil not at all.
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,
My motions in him, longer then they move,
His heart I know, how variable and vain
Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
And live for ever, dream at least to live
Forever, to remove him I decree,
And send him from the Garden forth to Till
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.

_Michael_, this my behest have thou in charge,
Take to thee from among the Cherubim
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
Vacant possession som new trouble raise:
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,
From hallowd ground th’ unholie, and denounce
To them and to thir Progenie from thence
Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg’d,
For I behold them soft’nd and with tears
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.
If patiently thy bidding they obey,
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale
To _Adam_ what shall come in future dayes,
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix
My Cov’nant in the Womans seed renewd;
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
And on the East side of the Garden place,
Where entrance up from _Eden_ easiest climbes,
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:
Least Paradise a receptacle prove
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,
With whose stol’n Fruit Man once more to delude.

He ceas’d; and th’ Archangelic Power prepar’d
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
Had, like a double _Janus_, all thir shape
Spangl’d with eyes more numerous then those
Of _Argus_, and more wakeful then to drouze,
Charm’d with _Arcadian_ Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
Of _Hermes_, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile
To resalute the World with sacred Light
_Leucothea_ wak’d, and with fresh dews imbalmd
The Earth, when _Adam_ and first Matron _Eve_
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,
Strength added from above, new hope to spring
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;
Which thus to _Eve_ his welcome words renewd.

_Eve_, easily may Faith admit, that all
The good which we enjoy, from Heav’n descends
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav’n
So prevalent as to concerne the mind
Of God high blest, or to incline his will,
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne
Ev’n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught
By Prayer th’ offended Deitie to appease,
Kneel’d and before him humbl’d all my heart,
Methought I saw him placable and mild,
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd
Home to my brest, and to my memorie
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now
Assures me that the bitterness of death
Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,
_Eve_ rightly call’d, Mother of all Mankind,
Mother of all things living, since by thee
Man is to live, and all things live for Man.

To whom thus _Eve_ with sad demeanour meek.
Ill worthie I such title should belong
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac’t
The sourse of life; next favourable thou,
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf’t,
Farr other name deserving.  But the Field
To labour calls us now with sweat impos’d,
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,
All unconcern’d with our unrest, begins
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,
I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?
Here let us live, though in fall’n state, content.

So spake, so wish’d much-humbl’d _Eve_, but Fate
Subscrib’d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips’d
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
The Bird of _Jove_, stoopt from his aerie tour,
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
First Hunter then, pursu’d a gentle brace,
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;
Direct to th’ Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.
_Adam_ observ’d, and with his Eye the chase
Pursuing, not unmov’d to _Eve_ thus spake.

O _Eve_, some furder change awaits us nigh,
Which Heav’n by these mute signs in Nature shews
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn
Us haply too secure of our discharge
From penaltie, because from death releast
Some days; how long, and what till then our life,
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,
And thither must return and be no more.
VVhy else this double object in our sight
Of flight pursu’d in th’ Air and ore the ground
One way the self-same hour? why in the East
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light
More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws
O’re the blew Firmament a radiant white,
And slow descends, with somthing heav’nly fraught.

He err’d not, for by this the heav’nly Bands
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
And carnal fear that day dimm’d _Adams_ eye.
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
_Jacob_ in _Mahanaim_, where he saw
The field Pavilion’d with his Guardians bright;
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd
In _Dothan_, cover’d with a Camp of Fire,
Against the _Syrian_ King, who to surprize
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,
Warr unproclam’d.  The Princely Hierarch
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise
Possession of the Garden; hee alone,
To finde where _Adam_ shelterd, took his way,
Not unperceav’d of _Adam_, who to _Eve_,
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.

_Eve_, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
Of us will soon determin, or impose
New Laws to be observ’d; for I descrie
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill
One of the heav’nly Host, and by his Gate
None of the meanest, some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,
As _Raphael_, that I should much confide,
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
He ended; and th’ Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes
A militarie Vest of purple flowd
Livelier then _Meliboean_, or the graine
Of _Sarra_, worn by Kings and Hero’s old
In time of Truce; _Iris_ had dipt the wooff;
His starrie Helme unbuckl’d shew’d him prime
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side
As in a glistering _Zodiac_ hung the Sword,
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.
_Adam_ bowd low, hee Kingly from his State
Inclin’d not, but his coming thus declar’d.

_Adam_, Heav’ns high behest no Preface needs:
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
Defeated of his seisure many dayes
Giv’n thee of Grace, wherein thou may’st repent,
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas’d
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;
But longer in this Paradise to dwell
Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
And send thee from the Garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast tak’n, fitter Soile.

He added not, for _Adam_ at the newes
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
That all his senses bound; _Eve_, who unseen
Yet all had heard, with audible lament
Discover’d soon the place of her retire.

O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day
That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,
That never will in other Climate grow,
My early visitation, and my last
At Eev’n, which I bred up with tender hand
From the first op’ning bud, and gave ye Names,
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke
Your Tribes, and water from th’ ambrosial Fount?
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee
How shall I part, and whither wander down
Into a lower World, to this obscure
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?

Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.
Lament not _Eve_, but patiently resigne
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,
Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
Where he abides, think there thy native soile.

_Adam_ by this from the cold sudden damp
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,
To _Michael_ thus his humble words addressd.

Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam’d
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
And in performing end us; what besides
Of sorrow and dejection and despair
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,
Departure from this happy place, our sweet
Recess, and onely consolation left
Familiar to our eyes, all places else
Inhospitable appeer and desolate,
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of him who all things can, I would not cease
To wearie him with my assiduous cries:
But prayer against his absolute Decree
No more availes then breath against the winde,
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
This most afflicts me, that departing hence,
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd
His blessed count’nance; here I could frequent,
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf’d
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk’d:
So many grateful Altars I would reare
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,
Or monument to Ages, and thereon
Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:
In yonder nether World where shall I seek
His bright appearances, or footstep trace?
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall’d
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.

To whom thus _Michael_ with regard benigne.
_Adam_, thou know’st Heav’n his, and all the Earth
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
All th’ Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
No despicable gift; surmise not then
His presence to these narrow bounds confin’d
Of Paradise or _Eden_: this had been
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred
All generations, and had hither come
From all the ends of th’ Earth, to celebrate
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine
God is as here, and will be found alike
Present, and of his presence many a signe
Still following thee, still compassing thee round
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
True patience, and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow, equally enur’d
By moderation either state to beare,
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life, and best prepar’d endure
Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend
This Hill; let _Eve_ (for I have drencht her eyes)
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak’st,
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.

To whom thus _Adam_ gratefully repli’d.
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
Thou lead’st me, and to the hand of Heav’n submit,
However chast’ning, to the evil turne
My obvious breast, arming to overcom
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,
If so I may attain.  So both ascend
In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken
Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
Our second _Adam_ in the Wilderness,
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.
His Eye might there command wherever stood
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls
Of _Cambalu_, seat of _Cathaian Can_
And _Samarchand_ by _Oxus_, _Temirs_ Throne,
To _Paquin_ of _Sinaean_ Kings, and thence
To _Agra_ and _Lahor_ of great _Mogul_
Down to the golden _Chersones_, or where
The _Persian_ in _Ecbatan_ sate, or since
In _Hispahan_, or where the _Russian Ksar_
In _Mosco_, or the Sultan in _Bizance_,
_Turchestan_-born; nor could his eye not ken
Th’ Empire of _Negus_ to his utmost Port
_Ercoco_ and the less Maritine Kings
_Mombaza_, and _Quiloa_, and _Melind_,
And _Sofala_ thought _Ophir_, to the Realme
Of _Congo_, and _Angola_ fardest South;
Or thence from _Niger_ Flood to _Atlas_ Mount
The Kingdoms of _Almansor_, _Fez_, and _Sus_,
_Marocco_ and _Algiers_, and _Tremisen_;
On _Europe_ thence, and where _Rome_ was to sway
The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
Rich _Mexico_ the seat of _Motezume_,
And _Cusco_ in _Peru_, the richer seat
Of _Atabalipa_, and yet unspoil’d
_Guiana_, whose great Citie _Geryons_ Sons
Call _El Dorado:_ but to nobler sights
_Michael_ from _Adams_ eyes the Filme remov’d
VVhich that false Fruit that promis’d clearer sight
Had bred; then purg’d with Euphrasie and Rue
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
And from the VVell of Life three drops instill’d.
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc’d,
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,
That _Adam_ now enforc’t to close his eyes,
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon rais’d, and his attention thus recall’d.

_Adam_, now ope thine eyes, and first behold
Th’ effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee, who never touch’d
Th’ excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir’d,
Nor sinn’d thy sin, yet from that sin derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.

His eyes he op’nd, and beheld a field,
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;
Ith’ midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,
Uncull’d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew’d,
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform’d.
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav’n
Consum’d with nimble glance, and grateful steame;
The others not, for his was not sincere;
Whereat hee inlie rag’d, and as they talk’d,
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus’d.
Much at that sight was _Adam_ in his heart
Dismai’d, and thus in haste to th’ Angel cri’d.

O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall’n
To that meek man, who well had sacrific’d;
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?

T’ whom _Michael_ thus, hee also mov’d, repli’d.
These two are Brethren, _Adam_, and to come
Out of thy loyns; th’ unjust the just hath slain,
For envie that his Brothers Offering found
From Heav’n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact
Will be aveng’d, and th’ others Faith approv’d
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
Rowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire.

Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way
I must return to native dust?  O sight
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!

To whom thus _Michael_.  Death thou hast seen
In his first shape on man; but many shapes
Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
More terrible at th’ entrance then within.
Some, as thou saw’st, by violent stroke shall die,
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more
In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know
What miserie th’ inabstinence of _Eve_
Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid
Numbers of all diseas’d, all maladies
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,
Dropsies, and Asthma’s, and Joint-racking Rheums.
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;
And over them triumphant Death his Dart
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok’t
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
Drie-ey’d behold?  _Adam_ could not, but wept,
Though not of Woman born; compassion quell’d
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew’d.

O miserable Mankind, to what fall
Degraded, to what wretched state reserv’d?
Better end heer unborn.  Why is life giv’n
To be thus wrested from us? rather why
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
What we receive, would either not accept
Life offer’d, or soon beg to lay it down,
Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus
Th’ Image of God in man created once
So goodly and erect, though faultie since,
To such unsightly sufferings be debas’t
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,
Retaining still Divine similitude
In part, from such deformities be free,
And for his Makers Image sake exempt?

Thir Makers Image, answerd _Michael_, then
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi’d
To serve ungovern’d appetite, and took
His Image whom they serv’d, a brutish vice,
Inductive mainly to the sin of _Eve_.
Therefore so abject is thir punishment,
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,
Or if his likeness, by themselves defac’t
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.

I yeild it just, said _Adam_, and submit.
But is there yet no other way, besides
These painful passages, how we may come
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?

There is, said _Michael_, if thou well observe
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
Till many years over thy head return:
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:
This is old age; but then thou must outlive
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne
A melancholly damp of cold and dry
To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume
The Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.

Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong
Life much, bent rather how I may be quit
Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,
Which I must keep till my appointed day
Of rendring up.  _Michael_ to him repli’d.

Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst
Live well, how long or short permit to Heav’n:
And now prepare thee for another sight.

He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound
Of Instruments that made melodious chime
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
Instinct through all proportions low and high
Fled and pursu’d transverse the resonant fugue.
In other part stood one who at the Forge
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass
Had melted (whether found where casual fire
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
Into fit moulds prepar’d; from which he formd
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought
Fulfil or grav’n in mettle.  After these,
But on the hether side a different sort
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent
To worship God aright, and know his works
Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
The Men though grave, ey’d them, and let thir eyes
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
Fast caught, they lik’d, and each his liking chose;
And now of love they treat till th’ Eevning Star
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok’t;
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.
Such happy interview and fair event
Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
And charming Symphonies attach’d the heart
Of _Adam_, soon enclin’d to admit delight,
The bent of Nature; which he thus express’d.

True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.

To whom thus _Michael_.  Judg not what is best
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
Created, as thou art, to nobler end
Holie and pure, conformitie divine.
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
Who slew his Brother; studious they appere
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg’d none.
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
Yet empty of all good wherein consists
Womans domestic honour and chief praise;
Bred onely and completed to the taste
Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
Religious titl’d them the Sons of God,
Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame
Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.

To whom thus _Adam_ of short joy bereft.
O pittie and shame, that they who to live well
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
But still I see the tenor of Mans woe
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.

From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
Said th’ Angel, who should better hold his place
By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.
But now prepare thee for another Scene.

He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
Single or in Array of Battel rang’d
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;
One way a Band select from forage drives
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,
But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;
Where Cattel pastur’d late, now scatterd lies
With Carcasses and Arms th’ ensanguind Field
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong
Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,
Assaulting; others from the Wall defend
With Dart and Jav’lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
In other part the scepter’d Haralds call
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
In factious opposition, till at last
Of middle Age one rising, eminent
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
And Judgement from above: him old and young
Exploded, and had seiz’d with violent hands,
Had not a Cloud descending snatch’d him thence
Unseen amid the throng: so violence
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
_Adam_ was all in tears, and to his guide
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
Inhumanly to men, and multiply
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
His Brother; for of whom such massacher
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav’n
Rescu’d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?

To whom thus _Michael_; These are the product
Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw’st;
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir’d,
And Valour and Heroic Vertu call’d;
To overcome in Battel, and subdue
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done
Of triumph, to be styl’d great Conquerours,
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
Destroyers rightlier call’d and Plagues of men.
Thus Fame shall be achiev’d, renown on Earth,
And what most merits fame in silence hid.
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
The onely righteous in a World perverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so beset
With Foes for daring single to be just,
And utter odious Truth, that God would come
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.

He look’d, & saw the face of things quite chang’d;
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
All now was turn’d to jollitie and game,
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.
At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
And of thir doings great dislike declar’d,
And testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
In prison under Judgements imminent:
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas’d
Contending, and remov’d his Tents farr off;
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
Measur’d by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
Contriv’d, and of provisions laid in large
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!
Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons
With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
From under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
Sent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain
Impetuous, and continu’d till the Earth
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting o’re the Waves, all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
Deep under water rould; Sea cover’d Sea,
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
Where luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d
And stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t.
How didst thou grieve then, _Adam_, to behold
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
Depopulation; thee another Floud,
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
By th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;
And scarce to th’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.

O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
Liv’d ignorant of future, so had borne
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot
Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst
The burd’n of many Ages, on me light
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
And hee the future evil shall no less
In apprehension then in substance feel
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
Man is not whom to warne: those few escap’t
Famin and anguish will at last consume
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope
When violence was ceas’t, and Warr on Earth,
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd
With length of happy days the race of man;
But I was farr deceav’d; for now I see
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,
And whether here the Race of man will end.
To whom thus _Michael_.  Those whom last thou sawst
In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
First seen in acts of prowess eminent
And great exploits, but of true vertu void;
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.
The conquerd also, and enslav’d by Warr
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign’d
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th’ Earth shall bear
More then anough, that temperance may be tri’d:
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav’d,
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
One Man except, the onely Son of light
In a dark Age, against example good,
Against allurement, custom, and a World
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes
Shall them admonish, and before them set
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come
On thir impenitence; and shall returne
Of them derided, but of God observd
The one just Man alive; by his command
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,
To save himself and houshold from amidst
A World devote to universal rack.
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg’d,
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts
Of Heav’n set open on the Earth shall powre
Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,
With all his verdure spoil’d, and Trees adrift
Down the great River to the op’ning Gulf,
And there take root an Iland salt and bare,
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
To teach thee that God attributes to place
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
And now what further shall ensue, behold.

He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie
Wrinkl’d the face of Deluge, as decai’d;
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass
Gaz’d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt
His Sluces, as the Heav’n his windows shut.
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,
And after him, the surer messenger,
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
The second time returning, in his Bill
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
Grateful to Heav’n, over his head beholds
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,
Betok’ning peace from God, and Cov’nant new.
Whereat the heart of _Adam_ erst so sad
Greatly rejoyc’d, and thus his joy broke forth.

O thou that future things canst represent
As present, Heav’nly instructer, I revive
At this last sight, assur’d that Man shall live
With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.
Farr less I now lament for one whole World
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce
For one Man found so perfet and so just,
That God voutsafes to raise another World
From him, and all his anger to forget.
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,
Distended as the Brow of God appeas’d,
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,
Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?

To whom th’ Archangel.  Dextrously thou aim’st;
So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
Though late repenting him of Man deprav’d,
Griev’d at his heart, when looking down he saw
The whole Earth fill’d with violence, and all flesh
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov’d,
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
And makes a Covenant never to destroy
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
His triple-colour’d Bow, whereon to look
And call to mind his Cov’nant: Day and Night,
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,
Both Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;
And Man as from a second stock proceed.
Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:
Henceforth what is to com I will relate,
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
This second sours of Men, while yet but few,
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,
With large Wine-offerings pour’d, and sacred Feast
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam’d, and dwell
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart, who not content
With fair equalitie, fraternal state,
Will arrogate Dominion undeserv’d
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;
Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)
With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse
Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:
A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl’d
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav’n,
Or from Heav’n claming second Sovrantie;
And from Rebellion shall derive his name,
Though of Rebellion others he accuse.
Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns
With him or under him to tyrannize,
Marching from _Eden_ towards the West, shall finde
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build
A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav’n;
And get themselves a name, least far disperst
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,
Regardless whether good or evil fame.
But God who oft descends to visit men
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower
Obstruct Heav’n Towrs, and in derision sets
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
Among the Builders; each to other calls
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,
As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav’n
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange
And hear the din; thus was the building left
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam’d.

Whereto thus _Adam_ fatherly displeas’d.
O execrable Son so to aspire
Above his Brethren, to himself affirming
Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv’n:
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl
Dominion absolute; that right we hold
By his donation; but Man over men
He made not Lord; such title to himself
Reserving, human left from human free.
But this Usurper his encroachment proud
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food
Will he convey up thither to sustain
Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire
Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,
And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?

To whom thus _Michael_.  Justly thou abhorr’st
That Son, who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
Rational Libertie; yet know withall,
Since thy original lapse, true Libertie
Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells
Twinn’d, and from her hath no dividual being:
Reason in man obscur’d, or not obeyd,
Immediately inordinate desires
And upstart Passions catch the Government
From Reason, and to servitude reduce
Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits
Within himself unworthie Powers to reign
Over free Reason, God in Judgement just
Subjects him from without to violent Lords;
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext
Deprives them of thir outward libertie,
Thir inward lost: Witness th’ irreverent Son
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,
_Servant of Servants_, on his vitious Race.
Thus will this latter, as the former World,
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
His presence from among them, and avert
His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;
And one peculiar Nation to select
From all the rest, of whom to be invok’d,
A Nation from one faithful man to spring:
Him on this side _Euphrates_ yet residing,
Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
While yet the Patriark liv’d, who scap’d the Flood,
As to forsake the living God, and fall
To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone
For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes
To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise
A mightie Nation, and upon him showre
His benediction so, that in his Seed
All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile
_Ur_ of _Chaldaea_, passing now the Ford
To _Haran_, after him a cumbrous Train
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth
With God, who call’d him, in a land unknown.
_Canaan_ he now attains, I see his Tents
Pitcht about _Sechem_, and the neighbouring Plaine
Of _Moreb_ there by promise he receaves
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;
From _Hamath_ Northward to the Desert South
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam’d)
From _Hermon_ East to the great Western Sea,
Mount _Hermon_, yonder Sea, each place behold
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare
Mount _Carmel_; here the double-founted stream
_Jordan_, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
Shall dwell to _Senir_, that long ridge of Hills.
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,
Whom _Faithful Abraham_ due time shall call,
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs
From _Canaan_, to a Land hereafter call’d
_Egypt_, divided by the River _Nile_;
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
He comes invited by a yonger Son
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that Realme
Of _Pharao_: there he dies, and leaves his Race
Growing into a Nation, and now grown
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call
_Moses_ and _Aaron_) sent from God to claime
His people from enthralment, they return
With glory and spoile back to thir promis’d Land.
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
To know thir God, or message to regard,
Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
With loath’d intrusion, and fill all the land;
His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,
Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,
And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,
Haile mixt with fire must rend th’ _Egyptian_ Skie
And wheel on th’ Earth, devouring where it rouls;
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,
A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
Of _Egypt_ must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds
This River-dragon tam’d at length submits
To let his sojourners depart, and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice
More hard’nd after thaw, till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass
As on drie land between two christal walls,
Aw’d by the rod of _Moses_ so to stand
Divided, till his rescu’d gain thir shoar:
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,
To guide them in thir journey, and remove
Behinde them, while th’ obdurat King pursues:
All night he will pursue, but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning Watch;
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud
God looking forth will trouble all his Host
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command
_Moses_ once more his potent Rod extends
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;
On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,
And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect
Safe towards _Canaan_ from the shoar advance
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,
Least entring on the _Canaanite_ allarmd
Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare
Return them back to _Egypt_, choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude; for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.
This also shall they gain by thir delay
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found
Thir government, and thir great Senate choose
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:
God from the Mount of _Sinai_, whose gray top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine
To civil Justice, part religious Rites
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech
That _Moses_ might report to them his will,
And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high Office now
_Moses_ in figure beares, to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times
Of great _Messiah_ shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites
Establisht, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes
Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram’d
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
The Records of his Cov’nant, over these
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
The Heav’nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,
Save when they journie, and at length they come,
Conducted by his Angel to the Land
Promisd to _Abraham_ and his Seed: the rest
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,
How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav’n stand still
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,
Mans voice commanding, Sun in _Gibeon_ stand,
And thou Moon in the vale of _Aialon_,
Till _Israel_ overcome; so call the third
From _Abraham_, Son of _Isaac_, and from him
His whole descent, who thus shall _Canaan_ win.

Here _Adam_ interpos’d.  O sent from Heav’n,
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne
Just _Abraham_ and his Seed: now first I finde
Mine eyes true op’ning, and my heart much eas’d,
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbidd’n knowledge by forbidd’n means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth
So many and so various Laws are giv’n;
So many Laws argue so many sins
Among them; how can God with such reside?

To whom thus _Michael_.  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
And therefore was Law given them to evince
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
Law can discover sin, but not remove,
Save by those shadowie expiations weak,
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde
Justification towards God, and peace
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
Perform, and not performing cannot live.
So Law appears imperfet, and but giv’n
With purpose to resign them in full time
Up to a better Cov’nant, disciplin’d
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
From imposition of strict Laws, to free
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
And therefore shall not _Moses_, though of God
Highly belov’d, being but the Minister
Of Law, his people into _Canaan_ lead;
But _Joshua_ whom the Gentiles _Jesus_ call,
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
Meanwhile they in thir earthly _Canaan_ plac’t
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
National interrupt thir public peace,
Provoking God to raise them enemies:
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
The second, both for pietie renownd
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock
Of _David_ (so I name this King) shall rise
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,
Foretold to _Abraham_, as in whom shall trust
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.
But first a long succession must ensue,
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam’d,
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.
Such follow him, as shall be registerd
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw’st
Left in confusion, _Babylon_ thence call’d.
There in captivitie he lets them dwell
The space of seventie years, then brings them back,
Remembring mercie, and his Cov’nant sworn
To _David_, stablisht as the dayes of Heav’n.
Returnd from _Babylon_ by leave of Kings
Thir Lords, whom God dispos’d, the house of God
They first re-edifie, and for a while
In mean estate live moderate, till grown
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
But first among the Priests dissension springs,
Men who attend the Altar, and should most
Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings
Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise
The Scepter, and regard not _Davids_ Sons,
Then loose it to a stranger, that the true
Anointed King _Messiah_ might be born
Barr’d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr
Unseen before in Heav’n proclaims him com,
And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire
His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;
They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire
Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.
A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire
The Power of the most High; he shall ascend
The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign
With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav’ns.

He ceas’d, discerning _Adam_ with such joy
Surcharg’d, as had like grief bin dew’d in tears,
Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.

O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand
What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,
Why our great expectation should be call’d
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,
High in the love of Heav’n, yet from my Loynes
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son
Of God most High; So God with man unites.
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.

To whom thus _Michael_.  Dream not of thir fight,
As of a Duel, or the local wounds
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome
_Satan_, whose fall from Heav’n, a deadlier bruise,
Disabl’d not to give thee thy deaths wound:
Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
Not by destroying _Satan_, but his works
In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,
Obedience to the Law of God, impos’d
On penaltie of death, and suffering death,
The penaltie to thy transgression due,
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
So onely can high Justice rest appaid.
The Law of God exact he shall fulfill
Both by obedience and by love, though love
Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
To a reproachful life and cursed death,
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
In his redemption, and that his obedience
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
To save them, not thir own, though legal works.
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem’d,
Seis’d on by force, judg’d, and to death condemnd
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,
The Law that is against thee, and the sins
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi’d,
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
But soon revives, Death over him no power
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace
By Faith not void of works: this God-like act
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy’d,
In sin for ever lost from life; this act
Shall bruise the head of _Satan_, crush his strength
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
Still follow’d him; to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learn’d
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve
Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
Pure, and in mind prepar’d, if so befall,
For death, like that which the redeemer dy’d.
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
Not onely to the Sons of _Abrahams_ Loines
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons
Of _Abrahams_ Faith wherever through the world;
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.
Then to the Heav’n of Heav’ns he shall ascend
With victory, triumphing through the aire
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines
Through all his realme, & there confounded leave;
Then enter into glory, and resume
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
Above all names in Heav’n; and thence shall come,
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
With glory and power to judge both quick & dead,
To judge th’ unfaithful dead, but to reward
His faithful, and receave them into bliss,
Whether in Heav’n or Earth, for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
Then this of _Eden_, and far happier daies.

So spake th’ Archangel _Michael_, then paus’d,
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire
Replete with joy and wonder thus repli’d.

O goodness infinite, goodness immense!
That all this good of evil shall produce,
And evil turn to good; more wonderful
Then that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,
To God more glory, more good will to Men
From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.
But say, if our deliverer up to Heav’n
Must reascend, what will betide the few
His faithful, left among th’ unfaithful herd,
The enemies of truth; who then shall guide
His people, who defend? will they not deale
Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?

Be sure they will, said th’ Angel; but from Heav’n
Hee to his own a Comforter will send,
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,
To guide them in all truth, and also arme
With spiritual Armour, able to resist
_Satans_ assaults, and quench his fierie darts
What Man can do against them, not affraid,
Though to the death, against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompenc’t,
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends
To evangelize the Nations, then on all
Baptiz’d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win
Great numbers of each Nation to receave
With joy the tidings brought from Heav’n: at length
Thir Ministry perform’d, and race well run,
Thir doctrine and thir story written left,
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav’n
To thir own vile advantages shall turne
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint,
Left onely in those written Records pure,
Though not but by the Spirit understood.
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
Places and titles, and with these to joine
Secular power, though feigning still to act
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv’n
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume:
Whence heavie persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes
Religion satisfi’d; Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,
To good malignant, to bad men benigne,
Under her own waight groaning, till the day
Appeer of respiration to the just,
And vengeance to the wicked, at return
Of him so lately promis’d to thy aid,
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
Last in the Clouds from Heav’n to be reveald
In glory of the Father, to dissolve
_Satan_ with his perverted World, then raise
From the conflagrant mass, purg’d and refin’d,
New Heav’ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love,
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.

He ended; and thus _Adam_ last reply’d.
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
Measur’d this transient World, the Race of time,
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,
And love with feare the onely God, to walk
As in his presence, ever to observe
His providence, and on him sole depend,
Merciful over all his works, with good
Still overcoming evil, and by small
Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victorie,
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.

To whom thus also th’ Angel last repli’d:
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs
Thou knewst by name, and all th’ ethereal Powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heav’n, Air, Earth, or Sea,
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
By name to come call’d Charitie, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee, happier farr.
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of Speculation; for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect
Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm’d
Portending good, and all her spirits compos’d
To meek submission: thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
The great deliverance by her Seed to come
(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.
That ye may live, which will be many dayes,
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer’d
With meditation on the happie end.

He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
Descended, _Adam_ to the Bowre where _Eve_
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak’t;
And thus with words not sad she him receav’d.

Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee
Art all things under Heav’n, all places thou,
VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,
Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,
By mee the Promis’d Seed shall all restore.

So spake our Mother _Eve_, and _Adam_ heard
VVell pleas’d, but answer’d not; for now too nigh
Th’ Archangel stood, and from the other Hill
To thir fixt Station, all in bright array
The Cherubim descended; on the ground
Gliding meteorous, as Ev’ning Mist
Ris’n from a River o’re the marish glides,
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
Homeward returning.  High in Front advanc’t,
The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz’d
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
And vapour as the _Libyan_ Air adust,
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
In either hand the hastning Angel caught
Our lingring Parents, and to th’ Eastern Gate
Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer’d.
They looking back, all th’ Eastern side beheld
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,
Wav’d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
With dreadful Faces throng’d and fierie Armes:
Som natural tears they drop’d, but wip’d them soon;
The World was all before them, where to choose
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE


A few words are necessary in preface to this story. After _When It Was
Dark_ made its appearance, the writer received a great number of letters
from his readers, and up to the present moment he still continues to
receive them.

Out of nearly two hundred communications, a large proportion are
concerned not so much with the main issue of the tale, as with
controversial matters in the Church of England arising from it.

The definitely Catholic[1] tone of the first book aroused, as might be
expected, vigorous protest, and no less vigorous commendation. The five
or six Bishops--and many other dignitaries--who preached or lectured
about the story avoided the controversial sides of it. But the writer
has received innumerable letters from the clergy and others to the
following effect.

[Footnote 1: The term ""Catholic"" is here, and throughout the book, used
in the sense in which it is employed by a certain division of the Church
of England and of the Episcopal Church of America.--The PUBLISHERS.]

It was pointed out to him that while the extreme ""Protestant"" party was
constantly employing fiction as a method of propaganda, churchmen were
almost unrepresented in this way. The Catholic Faith has been bitterly
assailed over and over again in books which are well enough written, and
have sufficient general interest to appeal to the man of the world, who
is often indifferent to the points debated.

After considerable discussion, the writing of _A Lost Cause_ was
resolved upon. The author desires to thank those priests who have
assisted him with their counsel and experience, and begs leave to
explain here something of his aims in publishing the tale.

At no period in modern Church history has the Church been assailed with
such malignance, slander, and untruth as at the present. ""Protestantism""
within the Church is a lost cause, it is dying, and for just this reason
the clamour is loudest, the misrepresentation more furious and
envenomed. Shrewd opportunists are taking their last chance of emerging
from obscurity by an appeal to the ignorance of the general public on
Church matters. Looking round us, we see dozens of uneducated and noisy
nobodies who have elected themselves into a sort of irregular prelacy
and dubbed themselves ""Defenders of the Faith,"" with about as much right
as Napoleon crowned himself emperor.

Church people do not take them very seriously. Their voices are like the
cries of hedge-birds by the road, on which the stately procession of the
Church is passing. But the man in the street is more attentive and he
enjoys the colour and movement of iconoclasm. He believes also that the
brawlers have right on their side.

But there is an inherent fairness in the man in the street, and, if this
story reaches him, he will have his opportunity to hear the Catholic
side of the argument.

The author begs to state that no single character in this tale is a
""portrait"" of any living person, or of any real person whatever. The
imaginary folk are designed to be merely typical, their methods are
analogous to much that is going on to-day under the pretences of
patriotism and love for religious liberty, but that is all.

There will probably be the usual nonsense written, and the braves of
""Protestantism"" will give the usual war-whoops. Whether this is to be
so or not, the author is profoundly indifferent.

He attacks those of the extreme ""Protestants"" whom he believes to be
insincere and who rebel against the Truth for their own ends. He does
not say or think that all ""Protestants""--even the extremists--are
insincere. He has endeavoured to point out that there is as much
difference between the street-corner ""Protestants"" and the pious
Evangelical Party within the Church as there is between Trinitarians and
Unitarians.

The incident in the tale where the Archbishop of Canterbury compels a
""Protestant"" publicist to give up the Blessed Sacrament, which he has
stolen from a church for purposes of propaganda, is founded on fact. It
has not before been made public, except in a short letter to the _Church
Times_ a few months ago, which was written with the design of preparing
Church readers for the detailed publication of such a painful incident.
The facts, however, have been supplied to the writer to make such use of
in the story as he thinks fit. The authors of this disgraceful
profanation have, naturally, been silent on the matter. It is not an
isolated instance. But it is not to be thought that the imaginary
characters concerned in the affair in the story, are intended to
represent, or do in any way, the real heroes of this great blow struck
for ""Protestant"" truth.

Finally, the noisiest ""Protestants"" are hitting the Church as hard as
they can. The author has endeavoured to hit back as hard as _he_ can--of
course, in that spirit of Christian love in which the ""Protestants""
themselves tell us these controversies are always conducted.

The brawlers have enjoyed an astonishing immunity hitherto, and it is
only fair that battle should be joined now. And, however inadequate his
forces and generalship, that is the writer's aim. He is, of course, a
_franc-tireur_, but he fires his musket on the right side, and with a
perfect assurance of the justice of his Cause.

CHAPTER I

THE INTERRUPTED EUCHARIST


The Church of St. Elwyn was a building of brick that went up to a great
height.

In the crowded district between Hornsey and Wood Green, it was one of
the largest buildings, and, though not externally beautiful, acquired
dignity and impressiveness from its setting of small villa houses, which
made an interminable brick wilderness all round it.

It was nearing the time of the High Celebration on a Sunday morning in
summer. Matins had been said in a side chapel, to a scanty congregation,
at half-past nine, and now the central act of the day was to take place.

The interior of St. Elwyn's was severe but beautiful, save for one or
two minor blemishes here and there.

The eye was caught and carried away down the aisles till it found its
focus on the high altar which was set like a throne, above many marble
steps, in the curve of the distant apse. The sanctuary was lighted from
the sides and so the eye was not disturbed and distracted by hideous
windows of stained glass with their clamorous coal-tar colours, but
could rest quietly upon the altar with its green and gold, its flowers
and central cross.

The organ was hidden away in a side gallery and the pulpit was a stone
bracket high in the sweep of the chancel arch, to which it clung like
the nest of a bird on a cliff side.

All this was as it should be. In so many English churches the object of
the builders appears to have been to destroy all the dignity and beauty
possible in a service. The organ and the pulpit are elevated to the
importance of shrines, and dominate everything like Gog and Magog in the
Guildhall. Everything is done to minimise the place and office of the
altar, to exalt the less important functions of worship, and to prevent
comfortable consciences from being uneasy in the realisation of the
presence of God.

Only one tawdry note could be detected in this beautiful church. The
pictures which hung on the walls round the aisles, and represented the
stations of the cross, were ill-drawn, and stiff in colour and design.
These pictures, which were said by the ignorant and unimaginative to be
idolatrous, or at least ""Roman""--a little understood but very
efficacious term of reproach in the parish--were sufficiently like the
hideous stained-glass figures in the Evangelical Church of St. Luke hard
by to have satisfied the most pious lover of ugliness. But those folk,
who so vehemently preferred the medallion portraits of their respectable
ancestors on the walls of a church to any other form of symbol or
decoration, did not see this. They spoke bitterly of the pictures as
being ""high,"" suggesting to outsiders unfamiliar with the parrot cry of
the partisan that they had been kept too long in a warm place.

Since Father Blantyre had been appointed vicar of St. Elwyn's, the
congregation had increased until few of the rush-bottomed chairs were
empty, and on days of great festivals, people would be found kneeling in
the aisles. The opposition party in the parish frequently commented on
this custom, which was thought to savour of heathenism or worse. One or
two people who had spent holidays in continental towns, and had made
excursions into foreign cathedrals in much the same spirit as they went
into the chamber of horrors in the wax-work exhibition, had brought back
news that this habit was in vogue among ""the Catholics."" It was felt
that real salvation could only be found in a pew, with one's name
legibly written on an ivory tablet at the end and the vestry-clerk
calling for the rent once a quarter in the decent old-fashioned way. Any
one who knelt on the uncushioned stone showed an anxiety to worship and
a superstitious abasement quite unworthy of a bluff, honest, British
Christian; and his doings must be displeasing to a Deity who, the
objectors were persuaded, was--though they did not say so in actual
words--a great _English_ God.

The single bell that summoned the people to Mass--that word which
church-people are becoming less afraid to use in this century--had
ceased. The server was lighting the Eucharistic candles with a long
taper.

As the people came in, it was noticeable that they proceeded to their
places without side-looks at each other, or muttered social greetings.
They went to their seats, young and old, men and women, and began to
kneel and pray.

No one, apparently, had come there to be seen by his fellows.

Since the Catholic Revival in the English Church, no fact has been more
obvious and easily determined than this. It is one which the bitterest
opponent of churchmanship has never been able to deny and has never
attempted to deny. The most prejudiced observer paying an alternate
visit to a church where the Faith is taught and to another which is
confessedly ""Protestant"" cannot fail to observe the difference. At the
celebration of the Eucharist in a church of the former type, there is an
absolute stillness and reverence. The congregation kneels, it worships.

In the latter, there is an unrest. People do not show marked
consciousness of being in the presence of mysteries. Whatever they may
think, they do not give the observer the impression that they think God
is there. They sit rather than kneel, they notice the clothes of other
people, there is a certain sense that they are doing the right thing in
""patronising"" the church, and the Sunday dinner looms large over all.

The man lit the candles. A moment afterwards Father Blantyre entered
with the servers and the service began.

The singing was simple but harmonious. There was nothing especially
noticeable in the hymn or the chanting of the Kyries after the
commandments.

The priest went into the pulpit, kissed the white stole, and placed it,
as a yoke, upon his shoulders. Over his head was a crucifix. He was a
small man, dark of hair, and swarthy of complexion. The nose was
prominent and aquiline, the eyes bright, with a net-work of fine
wrinkles round them, the mouth large and mobile. There was almost a
suggestion of the comedian in his face, that is, in its extreme mobility
and good-humour. One could imagine him as a merry man in his private
life. But mingled with this, one saw at once the lines of an unalterable
purpose, and of conviction. Any strong belief stamps itself upon a man's
face in an unmistakable way. When that belief is purely holy and good,
then we say that the man has the face of a saint.

For a moment or two, Mr. Blantyre looked round the church. The eyes, so
puckered at the corners, very much resembled the eyes of a sailor, who
is ever gazing out towards a vast horizon and through furious winds. Men
who are much occupied with the Unseen and Invisible sometimes have this
look, which is the look of a man who is striving to see God.

The subject-matter of the sermon itself was not very remarkable. It was
a sermon dealing with the aids to worship that symbol gives, showing how
a proper use of material objects may focus the brain upon the reality
behind them. During the last week or two, the local paper had been
printing some violent attacks upon the services at St. Elwyn's, for
there was a by-election in progress and one of the candidates was
seizing the opportunity afforded by a ""No Popery"" cry.

The local writer, the vicar pointed out, was obviously alarmed lest
people should worship too much. He spoke of the attacks with sincere
good humour and more than once his words provoked a smile. The
journalist, with the sublime ignorance of lesser local scribes, had
spoken of Queen Elizabeth and expressed a fervent desire that the times
of ""good Queen Bess"" would come again and that the Royal Spinster could
descend on the purlieus of Hornsey and sternly order all Romish toys to
be removed. Father Blantyre quoted Elizabeth's letter to Sandys:

     The queen's majesty considered it not contrary to the Word of
     God--nay, rather for the advantage of the church--that the image
     of Christ crucified,--together with Mary and John, should be placed
     as heretofore in some conspicuous part of the church, where they
     may the more readily be seen by all the people.

The last few words of the sermon were preparatory for the mystery that
was about to begin, an earnest exhortation to all there to make
themselves ready to receive the Lord, who was presently coming among
them.

There was nothing in the short discourse that was remarkable, but its
delivery was extraordinary. The words were uttered with a great
tenderness and solemnity, but quite without any formal note. There was
almost a gaiety in them now and then, a spiritual gaiety that was very
impressive. Father Blantyre leaned over the rail and talked to his
people. The voice, which sank into a whisper at times, and at others
rang out with a sharpness that echoed up in the lofty roof, never once
lost its suggestion of confidential intimacy with those to whom it
spoke. In the entire absence of the usual ""preaching"" note, the sermon
gained immensely in value with this particular audience. Anything
academic would have been endured, but it would not have gone home.

While the offertory sentences were being sung, the congregation saw
that a small group of people had entered the church, presumably to hear
Mass.

One of the churchwardens was able to find seats for the party about
half-way down the central aisle. The new-comers were four in number. All
of them were men.

It is perhaps strange to speak of one of their number as being the
""leader"" of the party, but that was the impression he gave to those
members of the congregation immediately around him. At the close of the
service, moreover, several worshippers agreed with each other that this
person had suggested that to them.

He was a shortish, thick-set man of some five and forty years of age.
His large, intelligent face was clean-shaved. The eyes were small and
very bright, shifting hither and thither in a constant flicker of
observation. The mouth was large, and though the lips were thick and
loose, there was nevertheless a certain resolution in them. They were
frequently curved into a half-smile which had something indescribably
sinister and impudent about it. One saw that, in whatever situation he
might find himself, this person would not easily be abashed or unready.

He wore a frock-coat of shining broadcloth. The waistcoat was cut low,
not as well-dressed people would wear it, showing a large expanse of
imitation shirt-front through which a black stud was thrust. A small bow
of black ribbon served as necktie. In some nameless way, he suggested a
peculiarly unpleasing type of irregular dissenting minister in his
appearance, and this was enhanced by the fact that under one arm he
carried a large Bible of limp leather, secured by an india-rubber band.

Yet, with all this, the new-comer had a remarkable and even arresting
personality. Wherever he went, he would not easily escape notice.

By his side sat a tallish youth with sufficient likeness to him to
proclaim a near relationship.

The young fellow's complexion was somewhat muddy, his hair was smooth
and mouse-coloured, his mouth resembled his father's, except that it had
not the impudent good-humour of the elder man's, and was altogether more
furtive and sly.

The two remaining members of the party were men apparently of the
prosperous small-tradesman type, pursy, flabby with good living, who
had added mutton-chop whiskers to their obvious self-esteem.

To one or two members of the congregation there, the father and son were
not unknown. The thick-set, clean-shaved man was Mr. Samuel Hamlyn, the
editor and proprietor of a small local journal,--the _Hornham
Observer_,--and the youth was his son, who acted as reporter to the
paper and signed himself S. Hamlyn, Junior.

Both were well known in local affairs; Hamlyn was a member of the
school-board and held one or two kindred positions. His religious
sympathies had hitherto been supposed to lie with the numerous
dissenting sects in the parish, all of whom had their bills and other
announcements printed at his office.

The momentary interest and stir created by the entrance of the party
died away almost immediately and Mass continued. Certainly no one in the
church realised that in a few short weeks the fat man with the smile
would be notorious all over England, and that they were to be present at
the very first step in the career of one of the shrewdest of vulgar
opportunists the country had ever known.

The seats reserved for the churchwardens were on the opposite side of
the aisle, but almost upon a level with those in which the new-comers
were seated--perhaps some two rows of chairs behind.

Accordingly Doctor Hibbert, the vicar's warden, had a clear view of the
four men just in front.

Hibbert was an upright, soldierly-looking man, who had, in fact, been an
army surgeon, and had now bought a practice in the parish. He was a
skilful doctor, and a man of considerable mental strength, who had made
himself indispensable in the district and was in the way of becoming a
wealthy man. His earnest churchmanship had not militated against his
success, even among the most extreme Protestants and Dissenters of
Hornham. He was known to be a first-class doctor, and he was too strong
a man for any one to take a liberty with, and of such superior power and
mould to the mass of lower-class people whom he attended that his
opinions were respected.

But going about as he did, among every one in the parish, the Doctor
knew far more of its internal state than any one else. Nothing is
concealed from a medical man in general practice. Confession is
compulsory to him; he sees the secrets of men's lives, knows the
tarnished story of the ""respectable"" person, as sometimes the heroism of
the outcast. Hibbert had his finger on the public pulse of Hornham in a
measure that Father Blantyre himself could hardly achieve.

It was therefore with some little uneasiness and a good deal of
conjecture that the doctor had noticed the advent of Hamlyn and his
party.

The disturbances to public worship which are so familiar to-day were
quite unknown at that time. Hibbert anticipated nothing of what actually
occurred, but his eye was watchful nevertheless.

The Mass went on.

The servers knelt on the altar steps in cotta and cassock, the priest
moved above them in his stiff, flowered chasuble, robed in the garments
of the Passion of our Lord.

The Comfortable Words were said, and the Sursum Corda began.

A deep throbbing sound came from the organ, and, in one great outburst
of solemn avowal, the congregation lifted up their hearts to God.

    SURSUM CORDA!
    HABEMUS AD DOMINUM
    GRATIAS AGAMUS DOMINO DEO NOSTRO!

Ever since the days of the Apostles, the Mass had been said thus, the
most solemn part of the service had begun with these profound words of
adoration. The doctor forgot all else as he worshipped.

Let it be remembered, in the light of what follows, that the vast
majority of the people there believed this, were waiting for
_this_--they believed that when the priest said the Prayer of
Consecration, our Lord Himself had come suddenly among them.

Throughout the rite there was a growing sense and assurance of One
coming. Most of them were quite sure of it.

Human hearts, worn with the troubles of the week, sick to death, it may
be, of a hard material lot, now bowed in contrition and repentance, or
were filled with a certain Hope. Everything in this world was as
nothing, because, upon the altar before which the priest was bending so
low, they believed that God had come.

In what way, or how, they did not know and could not have explained. Did
they _imagine_ it week after week as they knelt in church? Most of them
_knew_ that it was no imagination or delusion that caught at their
hearts, that changed the air of the building in a swift moment, that
caught up heart and soul and spirit in one great outpouring of love and
faith and adoration.

Was _this_ a fable, as folks sometimes told them? This which dissolved
and broke the chains of bodily sense, banished the world, and enfolded
them with its awful sweetness, its immeasurable joy? What else in life
had power to do this, power to hurry away clogging, material things as
in a mighty spiritual wind, to show them once more the stupendous
sacrifice of the Saviour--what else but the indubitable presence of our
Lord?

The priest held up the Host.

At that supreme moment, Doctor Hibbert, whose state of mind may be taken
as typical of many others there, bent in humble adoration and
contrition.

An absolute silence lay over the church; there was not the slightest
sound or movement in it.

A chair was pushed harshly over the tiles, there was a heavy shuffling
of feet. Such sounds in that holy moment affected some of the
worshippers as a physical blow might have done.

But few people looked up. Many of them did not hear the sound, their
ears being tuned to harmonies that were not of this world.

The doctor heard the noise with his ears, but for a merciful moment it
did not penetrate to his brain. And then with a horrid clangour the
visible things of the world came rushing back to him.

He looked up.

The four men just in front of him had risen in their places. The two
tradesmen were red in the face and manifestly uneasy. They breathed
hard, a breath of ostentatious defiance.

Young Hamlyn was glancing round the church with swift, malevolent
movements of his head. His eyes flickered hither and thither until they
finally settled on the motionless figure at the altar, the figure with
the upstretched arm.

The elder Hamlyn held a paper in his hand, from which he began to read
in a loud, unsteady voice:

""_I, Samuel Hamlyn, a lawful parishioner of St. Elwyn's parish, Hornham,
do hereby rise and protest against the illegal and blasphemous fable of
the Mass as performed in this church. And as a member of the Protestant
Church of England I give notice----_""

Every one had risen to his feet. In a distant corner of the church, a
woman began to shriek. A murmur broke into shouts, there was a crash of
some heavy body falling.

A horrid tumult seemed broken loose, as if it had been confined till now
and had broken its bars with one great effort.

In a second, the four men were surrounded by a pushing crowd of men,
beside themselves with horror and anger. Sticks began to quiver in the
air, the crash of the chairs as they were overturned was like the
dropping rattle of musketry fire.

The hard voice of the brawler had gone up a full tone. In its
excitement, it dominated an abominable chorus of shouting.

In half a minute, the doctor and other members of the congregation had
Hamlyn and his son gripped by the arms and were hurrying them towards
the west door without any answer to their frantic threats and menaces.
The other two men followed stolidly.

Nearly every face was turned away from the altar.

The one or two people who had fallen trembling upon their knees when the
riot was at its height saw that the vicar was also kneeling in adoration
of the Blessed Sacrament.

A loud metallic _clang_ resounded through the church. The door was
barred, the brawlers were shut out.

When the maimed, polluted rite was at last concluded, amid deep sobs
from men and women alike, Father Blantyre gave the blessing. They saw
with deep sympathy that the tears were rolling down his cheeks also.

But the doctor saw, with a sudden quickening of the pulses, that the
first finger and the thumb were joined still. It is the custom of the
priest, after he has broken the bread, that the finger and thumb are
never parted till Mass is said.

They were not parted now.

The fact comforted and cheered the doctor. He had been on battle-fields
and had not known the fear and horror he had known to-day.




CHAPTER II

MR. HAMLYN AND SON AT HOME


Mr. Hamlyn lived in Alexandra Road, Hornham. The actual name of his
house was ""Balmoral,"" and it was one of seven or eight other residences
gathered together under the generic title of ""Beatrice Villas.""

The father and son turned into the little path which led up to the
imitation satin-wood door some twenty minutes after the gate of St.
Elwyn's had been barred to them. Their companions, Mr. Burgoyne and Mr.
Moffatt, had left them at the corner of the street, very flustered at
what they had done, and with a dull remorse flitting about their thick
skulls, that they had joined in ""Hamlyn's little game."" Nor did the
repeated assurances of the journalist, that Mr. Herbert--the Liberal
candidate--would ""see them through it,"" help them to recover their peace
of mind. Visions of police-court proceedings and an unenviable notoriety
in the daily papers were very vivid, and they parted with their chief
in mingled sorrow and anger.

Mr. Hamlyn let himself and his son into the little hall of his villa. A
smell of roast meat gave evidence that dinner would soon be ready. Both
men turned into the parlour on the left of the passage. It was a room
which showed signs of fugitive rather than regular use. Two or three
long boxes bearing the name of a local draper stood upon the round table
in the centre. The contents showed that Miss Hamlyn, the agitator's only
daughter, had been occupied in the choice of corsets.

The walls of the parlour were covered with a rich mauve and gold paper,
which gave a dignity to the cut-glass lustres of the chandelier. The
pictures, heavily framed in gold, were spirited representations of
scenes from the Old Testament. On the rack of the rosewood piano--which
stood open--was a song called ""Roses that Bloomed in my Heart.""

The chairs, arranged around the wall with commendable regularity, were
upholstered in plum-coloured plush. On one of them was a card-box of a
vivid green, containing several clean collars of the particular sort
Hamlyn Junior wore; on another stood the wooden box where his father's
silk hat was kept when not in use on Sundays and other important days.

Mr. Hamlyn took off his frock coat and removed the reversible cuffs that
were attached to the sleeves of his flannel shirt by means of an
ingeniously contrived clip. He then put on a loose coat of black alpaca.
His son, having gone through something of the same process, followed his
father to the sitting-room next the little kitchen.

As the parlour was not often used for ceremonial occasions, the Hamlyns
not being very hospitable people, it served as an occasional
dressing-room also, and saved running up-stairs.

The sitting-room window looked out into the backyard, immediately by the
kitchen door, which led into it. As the Hamlyns came in, they were able
to see their servant throwing some hot liquid--the water in which the
cabbage had been boiled, as a matter of fact--into the grid in the
centre of the yard.

The table was already laid for the meal. As, however, it was rather a
long table and the Hamlyns were only three in family,--Hamlyn being a
widower,--the white cloth was laid only on half of it. One or two
volumes of the Heartsease Novelettes and some artificial flowers, with
which a hat was to be trimmed by Miss Hamlyn, were thus left
undisturbed.

""Dinner didn't ought to be long,"" Mr. Hamlyn remarked.

""'Ope not,"" said his son shortly. ""I'll holler to Maud.""

Miss Hamlyn came in soon afterwards, followed by the maid with a joint
of roast beef. The editor's daughter was a tall girl with sulky lips,
bold eyes, and a profusion of dark hair. This last was now screwed round
her forehead in curling-pins.

The two men attacked their dinner in silence. Both of them had tucked a
handkerchief round their necks, in order to preserve the Sunday
waistcoat from droppings of food, a somewhat wise precaution, as both of
them ate very rapidly.

""Maud,"" said Hamlyn at length, ""can you do a bit of typing for me this
afternoon?""

""No, then, I can't, Pa,"" she replied resentfully, ""and it's like you to
ask it. On the Sabbath, too! I'm going out with Gussie Davies for a
walk.""

""Touch the 'arp lightly, my dear,"" he replied, ""no need to get your
feathers up.""

""Well, Pa,"" she answered, ""I'm sure I'm ready to spank the beastly
machine for you all the week, you know I am. But Sundays is different.""

Hamlyn made no reply. Both he and his son were thinking deeply, and as
yet no reference had escaped them as to the doings of the morning.
Although the girl knew there was something special afoot, she was not
much interested in the details, being at all times a person much
occupied with her own affairs.

During the pudding, she had a short and slangy conversation with her
brother, and directly the meal was over she went up-stairs to ""dress.""

The servant removed the plates and dishes, and Hamlyn and his son sat
down at the table. The father drew a large portfolio of papers towards
him. The son lighted a cheap cigarette.

Both of the Hamlyns spoke fairly correctly in public, though with the
usual cockney twang. In the seclusion of Balmoral, neither of them
thought it necessary to be very particular about the aspirates which
they emphasised so carefully elsewhere.

""When will Mr. Herbert pay up?"" said Sam.

""To-morrow. I shall see him in the committee room during the afternoon,
and it's five and twenty pound earned as easy as I ever earned anything
in my life. It'll come in very 'andy too. There's the rent on the
linotype machine just due.""

""The money's all right,"" answered the younger man, ""and, of course,
we're guaranteed against fines and anything of that sort. But do you
think the game's worth the candle? How will opinion in the parish go?""

""Like a house on fire. Wait till you see my leader in Wednesday's issue.
Mr. Herbert has put me up to the whole thing. We're carrying out a
patriotic Henglish duty. Public sympathy will all be with us. Rome is
creeping in among us!""

Sam grinned. ""Well, you know best, Father, of course. And we're bound to
support Mr. Herbert.""

""I've been thinking a great deal,"" Hamlyn answered slowly. ""I've always
been an ambitious man and I've always meant to come out on top somehow
or other. But I've never had a big chance yet. I think,--I'm not
sure,--but I _think_ I see that chance waiting now.""

His shrewd face was lighted up with a curious excitement. The eyes
glowed and the impudent merriment on the lips became more pronounced
than before.

""What is it then?""

""Listen quietly to me for a few minutes. The idea came gradual to me. I
got on the track six months ago. First of all, it was the ten gross of
religious books I had down in the shop. They were of all sorts. Which
was the one that went best? Why, it was _The Adventures of Susan
Lefever, the Captive Nun_. I sold 'em all out in no time. The next best
seller was _The Revelations of Pastor Coucherrousset, the Converted
Catholic Priest_. Anything against Rome! Mr. Leatherbarrow, of the New
Connection Methodists, preached three times on those books. He had all
the congregation fair shaking with indignation against the Scarlet
Woman. You see it's like this. People want a cock-shy. They don't much
care about what it is, as long as they've got it--see the way they're
down on the Sheenies in France. Now a religious cock-shy is the best of
all. It gives people a feeling that they're in real earnest, and they
can kid themselves and other people that it's more disinterested than
politics, for instance. They've nothing to get by it--except the fun of
doing it--and that flatters 'em because they're always on the grab in
every other way. See?""

Sam nodded. He was not one of those youths who despise the words of
parental wisdom. He was not himself a fool, and so he did not fall into
the mistake of underrating his father's capacity and knowledge of life.
The small and vulgar triumphs of Hamlyn's career were all appreciated
and noted by his son, who had a sincere respect for him.

""Very well, then,"" Hamlyn continued. ""It's a sure draw, all over
England, to raise the anti-popery cry. The wholesale trade tell me that
the business done in Fox's _Book of Martyrs_ is a perfect knock-out year
by year, and there's a sure sale for the smaller books about the priests
larking with the girls in the confessional and so forth. Anything with
'Secret History' or 'Jesuit' on the title-page 'll sell like the
_Evening News_ on Derby Day. Now, I've been reading all the publications
of the regular Protestant societies during the last few weeks. Plenty of
cuts at the Ritualists, lots of little sixpennies bound in cloth to
prove as there isn't no such thing as apostolic succession, that wafers
is illegal, and the Eastern position rather worse than arson. They're
all very well in their way, but they're written by D.D.'s and M.A.'s and
such like, who don't care to go too far. I have a list in my portfolio
here of the regular Protestant writers--nearly all _class_, my boy.
Listen here:

""_Transubstantiation and the Invocation of Saints._ Rev. J. Cummer,
Canon Residentiary of Ironpool.

""_Popery the Work of 'the Adversary,'--the Roman Clergy under Satanic
Influence._ Rev. R. S. Blanken, LL.D., incumbent of Christ Church,
Oxton.

""_Ritualism in the English Church: A Word of Warning._ Rev. Joshua Cafe,
D.D., prebendary of Bath and Wells.

""There's dozens of others like this. They're all very well in their way,
but they don't strike the really _popular_ note. They've broken the
ground and sowed the seed, but they're not going to reap the harvest.""

""Who is, then, Father? And what'll it be worth when it is reaped?""

""Us, my boy. As to the worth of it, go on listening to me and you'll see
things gradually getting clearer. I want you to see how I've worked it
all out. If we _do_ strike oil, all I'm telling you now will be
valuable. During my local work for the Protestant cause down here, I've
been brought in touch with members of the old-established societies and
I've taken the length of their foot. They're too dignified altogether.
Real live methods don't appeal to them. Financially they don't do badly,
but nothing like what they _might_ do if they adopted the right methods.
All their subscriptions come from the upper classes, and there's a whole
goldmine lying at their doors which is quite untouched! _abso-lute-ly_
unworked, Sam! The middle classes and the lower classes haven't _begun_
to give to the Protestant cause. Why? Because it hasn't been put
prominently before them in the way they'll understand. Bang the
field-piece! twang the lyre! thump the tub! rattle the tambourine!
That's the way. Look at the Salvation Army! The time is ripe for new
methods and for a new man who isn't a canon residentiary or a D.D. I've
got all the ritualistic statistics. Day by day the Ritualists are trying
it on, getting nearer and nearer to Rome. Everything is ready.""

""I see all that, Father. All you say is clear enough. What I _don't_ see
yet is what you mean to do.""

""I'm coming to that. For several years now, I've been prominent in
Hornham affairs. I'm known as a platform speaker in all the
denominations. What do you suppose I did this for six months ago?"" he
touched the lapel of his coat, looking down on it as he did so.

""Oh!"" he said, ""I forgot I'd changed into my old jacket. I was alluding
to the temperance non-smoking ribbon. It's in my frock-coat. Well, I
mentioned it just to point out that I'm known as a man associated with
all good causes.""

""But only locally, Pa.""

""Exactly. That is all I need to start with. Now, to-day I began: 'Mr.
Hamlyn, a prominent resident in Hornham and a staunch supporter of the
Henglish Protestant Church, has at last felt it his duty to protest
against the illegal practices at St. Elwyn's in as public a manner as
possible.' I've struck a new note, see? What I've done to-day has hardly
ever been done before. Now, why shouldn't this inaugurate a big public
movement all over the country? Why shouldn't offices be taken in the
Strand and a new League started, 'Hamlyn's Protestant Crusade' or
something of that sort? To begin with, subscriptions are invited for
the circulation of real fighting Protestant literature, hot stuff,
giving accounts of the illegal and Romish doings all over the country. I
know where to get the pamphlets written for a mere song, and startlers,
too. Of course, we have all the printing done at the works here in
Hornham,--that'll be worth something considerable. Meanwhile, mark what
happens. The 'silly season' comes on and the newspapers haven't got much
to write about. Our little London concern is established and then we
begin touring round to all the Ritualistic churches and protesting
against their aims. If I know what I'm talking about, in a fortnight or
three weeks one of the biggest booms of the century will begin!
Everything we do will be in the papers, rows in the churches,
police-court proceedings--everything. Whenever I write a letter of
protest to the Bishop of London or the Archbishop of Canterbury it will
appear in all the papers. It don't matter what they say as long as they
mention the Crusade! Then'll come the moment when we really launch out
and become a national Institution. We'll get half a dozen parsons and
fifth-rate M.P.'s to form a committee, and some one to be a treasurer:
he's easy found. Then I become secretary and you assistant-secretary:
we are _salaried_ officials, of course, and we start a little magazine
as the Society's official organ--to be printed at the works. I've many
more ideas for the extension of the plan,--brilliant ideas some of them,
too. But I won't go into them now. I've only given you the roughest
outline of the scheme as yet. Meanwhile, as a preliminary, I'm going to
flimsy out a dozen short reports of to-day's proceedings at St. Elwyn's,
and I want you to run up to Fleet Street with them, about five this
evening. All the dailies will print it.""

He chuckled. ""That's the chief beauty of the scheme,"" he continued; ""you
get the majority of your advertisements free, and in the best papers,
too! It's about the only scheme I ever heard of that could.""

He stopped at last and sank back in his chair, exhausted. He had spoken
long and with great animation, with all the tricks and mannerisms of
rough-and-tumble platform oratory, in which he was a master. The
pantomime of his expressive gestures, the indescribable impudence of the
smile as he sought to prove some depth of folly in the public, the quick
inflections of the voice, gave great force to his words. They sounded
convincing to the younger Hamlyn, into whose muddy pallor a deep red
flush had gradually come.

""It's a big thing, Pa,"" he said at length, ""a very big thing. I see
that, and you're the one to make it go. But there's a lot to be done
first. 'Ave we the ready money to start it? Even in a small way, to get
it once before the public will cost four or five hundred pounds.""

""That's the difficulty, Sam, I admit it. We are pretty low down at
present. The business just keeps its head above water, that's all. The
money from Mr. Herbert is a help, but it's all gone as soon as we get
it. I was thinking that if to-day's little protest makes a stir and we
can do ditto round-abouts during the next week or two, we could get
Moffatt and Burgoyne to advance a hundred each, p'r'aps. As a personal
loan. Mr. Herbert would be good for fifty now, but as soon as he's
elected you'll see he won't bother any more. When we've made the whole
thing hum, he'll come to us and offer to be our Parliamentary
representative. I'm reserving him for that. He'll be useful to ask
questions and help the fizz-up generally. It'll suit him because he'll
have a chance of getting his name in the papers, and it's about the
only chance he will have of getting prominent in the House. But, as far
as the preliminary stages are concerned, my opinion is that he's N.G.
The worst of it is that with a scheme of this sort one can't very well
put it on the market. That's the one drawback of a religious scheme.
There's lots of men who'd see the money in it, but who'd see that if
they joined they couldn't touch a cent. There can't be more than one or
two salaried officials. No, we must depend upon ourselves entirely. I'm
not afraid. It's what Napoleon did, and I'm going to be the Protestant
Napoleon! There's a lot in catchwords--speaking on a side issue--'The
Luther League!' 'Smithfield Soldiers!' or Bunyan's 'Holy War' might be
revived.""

""No, Pa, that wouldn't do now. 'Holy' is a regular Ritualistic word.""

""Well, so it is, Sam. I hadn't thought of it. I'm glad to see that
you've got a good grip of the thing.""

There was a silence in the mean little room. In the adjacent kitchen,
the servant could be heard singing, ""Ower lod geris anoice yeng men, ow
dear, ow dear naow!"" A big green-bellied fly sung and drummed on the
window-pane in the afternoon sunlight. Hamlyn, replete with enthusiasm
and beef, had taken off his alpaca coat and unloosed his collar. The air
was heavy with the odour of food and the acrid smell of Sam's
""ten-for-threepence"" cigarettes, while a penetrating smell of new
calico, proceeding from some of Maud's dressmaking operations, dominated
it all.

A church bell, ringing for afternoon service, was heard not far away.

Suddenly Hamlyn struck the table a sounding blow with his fist.

""It _is_ a good thing,"" he shouted in a wild burst of enthusiasm.

The voice was so full, and confident, that it rang out in the place like
a trumpet.

It had the true accent of an enthusiast, of a leader. There was
mesmerism in it. Hearing it, one would have said that this man would
succeed.

He could influence others, he had energy, resource, and temperamental
force. It was true. The man was gifted. He had power, and to whatever
end that might be directed it would not lose its efficacy. The
conviction of success, its trumpet note, was to become familiar in vast
hysterical assemblies. It was to be mistaken for a deep and earnest
wish to purify the Church, to scatter the wolves from the environs of
the fold. Greed can be sonorous. Tartuffe can always find his Orgon, and
to hawk a battle-cry among the ignorant and dull has ever been a
profitable game.

""I've a word to say, Pa,"" the son echoed; ""I've an idea where the first
cash is to come from.""

""Good, my boy. Let's have it.""

""What about Miss Pritchett?""

Hamlyn looked reproachfully at his son. ""What about the monument!"" he
answered with a sneer. ""She's got the cash, she's got tons of it. But
she's a red-hot Ritualist and Romaniser. Ask me another, Sam.""

Samuel smiled slyly. ""Wait a mo, Pa,"" he said. ""I know a good deal more
about Miss Pritchett than you do. I've been walkin' out with Augusta
Davis lately. She's a friend of Maud's.""

""The companion, you mean? Miss Pritchett's companion? Oh, you've been
smelling round in that quarter, have you?""

""And I've learnt a bit. I know all that goes on. Gussie tells me and
Maud everything. Miss Pritchett's getting tired of St. Elwyn's. She
can't boss the new vicar like she used the old one. As for the Roman
business, she doesn't really care for it. She's nothing to amuse herself
with except that and her ailments. It's the old cat's vanity, that's
all. She likes to be a patroness.""

""That's the sort of woman we want,"" answered Mr. Hamlyn, obviously
struck by the the word. ""There are a lot of rich, single old judies only
fit to be patronesses. They're cut out for it. Do you really think
anything could be done.""

""I do most certainly, Pa. I 'appen to know that Miss Pritchett is
getting on very bad terms with Blantyre. He won't stand her meddling.
I've one or two ideas in my head to help it along. Gussie'll do anything
I tell her.""

""Well, Sam, you do all you can. We won't talk about the matter any more
now. I've got a lot of strings to pull, and I've got a lot of matters in
my mind. We shall get a summons for brawling to-morrow, I expect. I'm
done up now, and I'm going to have a nap. Wake me up in an hour if I'm
asleep, and I'll get out the flimsies for to-morrow's papers.""

Hamlyn possessed that faculty of sleeping at any moment, and of waking
when it suited him, that so often goes with any marked executive
capacity.

He stretched himself upon the little horsehair sofa and covered his face
with his handkerchief.

Samuel picked up one of the ""Heartsease"" novelettes and tried to read in
it. But his brain was alight with the splendour of the new project, and
he could not concentrate his thought upon _Joyce Heathcote's Lover_.

It was thus that the seeds of the new movement were sown, in the back
parlour at Balmoral, Beatrice Villas, Alexandra Road. Historians tell us
that even greater and more epoch-making movements than Mr. Hamlyn's was
destined to be, have originated in even less pretentious dwellings.

Many of us have seen the little house in the Brede Kirk Street of the
old Dutch town, on which is written, _Haec est parva domus natus qua
magnus Erasmus_.

Mr. Hamlyn, Junior, had never heard of Erasmus, but he saw visions of
greatness on that afternoon.




CHAPTER III

LORD HUDDERSFIELD AND THE GUESTS AT SCARNING COURT


From April until the beginning of August, Lord Huddersfield generally
lived at his house at Scarning, the famous old Tudor mansion on the
river, below Pangbourne.

Peers who are something more than merely ""in society"" are generally
known to the public at large by reason of some cause which they benefit,
defend, or are associated with. When it is not a cause, it is a business
that gives such an one his label for the man in the street.

Lord _So-and-so_ is, of course, the great banker or brewer; Lord _This_
is the famous picture collector, who has all the Holbeins; Lord _That_
is known to be the best amateur actor, billiard player, or breeder of
bloodhounds in England. In an age when all celebrities are easily
distinguished thus, Lord Huddersfield, was perfectly familiar to
everyone as the great organising churchman. The ordinary person would
say, ""Lord Huddersfield? Oh, yes, the great Ritualistic Johnny,""
imagining that he had summed up his man with completeness. Yet, saving
only to churchmen and their antagonists--a very small proportion of the
public to-day--Lord Huddersfield was personally quite unknown. He was
hardly ever caricatured in the comic papers or pictured in the more
serious illustrated journals. His face was wholly unfamiliar; the
details of his private life formed no portion of the gossip papers. To
the vast army of English folk, who are utterly indifferent to religious
questions, he was nothing more than a name.

He had only once excited a really general flicker of interest. On the
occasion of a visit to Italy, like many other distinguished visitors to
the capital, he had been received in audience by the Bishop of Rome. As
usual, the evening papers had published ""rumours.""

    ""LORD HUDDERSFIELD AND THE POPE.
      WILL HE BECOME A CATHOLIC?""

had appeared as a scare head-line in one enterprising sheet, and the
peer's telegram, stating that he had been one for many years had been
hastily printed as a startling revelation--until some charitable person
had stepped round to the office and explained the joke to a bewildered
Scotch editor, and the paragraph was excised from later editions.

This much for the figure he cut to the outside world. In the English
Church, he was looked upon as one of the leading laymen, if not the
chief of all of them. He was the proprietor of the great weekly paper
known as the _Church Standard_. He was the chairman of many church
societies, the friend and patron of all Anglican movements and
institutions, and a man whose word carried enormous weight and power.

In private life, his two children and his intimate friends found him
true, devout, diligent, winning all hearts by opening his own, where one
found a singular freshness and simplicity. He went as little into
general society as he could, for all his thoughts and aims were occupied
in one endeavour.

On the Monday after the events in Hornham, Agatha Poyntz and her brother
James were in the lovely private backwater of Scarning. Their punt was
moored to the side of a tiny island, set like a gem in the clear brown
water, the red silk cushions of the boat making a vivid splash of colour
on the bank. With these two was Miss Poyntz's great friend and
confidante, Lucy Blantyre, the only sister of the vicar of St. Elwyn's.

Lucy was a girl of medium height, not at all the willowy modern heroine
of pictures and romance. Her hair was of a deep, dead black, coiled on a
small Greek head. Her complexion was dark, like that of her brother, the
priest, but quite without a certain sallowness that was noticeable in
him. It had the dusky paleness, the pearl-like _morbidezza_ of some
southern types, and, despite the lack of colour, showed a perfect and
happy health. The mouth was rather large. Mockery lurked there, and in
the dark eyes a lambent and somewhat scornful humour was wont to play.

Agatha Poyntz was a tall and merry girl--""a nut-brown maid"" her father
called her. Her round, plump face showed a sheer light-heartedness and
joy in life that was always refreshing to people who found this life
rather a drab and ordinary affair. The care-worn priests and churchmen
who were her father's friends, men who were always too painfully aware
of the great stream of human tears which is for ever falling through the
shadows of the world, were all fond of her freshness and sparkle. And,
so the wisest of them thought that since she took nothing seriously, and
was quite untouched by the vexing problems in which they were
submerged, it was perhaps a good thing that so gay and bright a creature
should come into their lives for a space, realising that, after all, God
made the butterflies which hovered so daintily over the Scarning
water-flowers upon their painted fans.

James Poyntz, Lord Huddersfield's only son, was a very different type.
He resembled his dead mother, a daughter of the Duke of St. Just. He was
tall, slender, and muscular. His face was clean-shaved, lean, and with a
heavy jaw, not the heaviness that signals sensuality and dulness, but
purpose and resolution. His eyes were grey, and glittered when he became
animated, and his clear, cold voice grew emphatic.

Not long before, he had come down from Oxford, where he had
distinguished himself in the history schools, and also by availing
himself of the little-used permission to absent himself from chapel and
the examination known as ""Divinity Moderations,"" granted to men who have
come of age, and who sign a declaration of their absolute and sincere
disbelief in the supernatural. It had been a piquant spectacle to the
sceptic undergraduates and younger dons, to see the son and heir of
Lord Huddersfield openly scornful and protesting against all that his
father held so dear, and quietly taking the much severer tests that the
University statutes impose upon those who would dispense with the
puerile divinity examination.

James Poyntz was on rather bad terms with his father. There was no
confidence between them, and perhaps but little love--though that had
never been tested. The young man had a sufficient fortune from his
mother, and his father was prepared to supplement his income in any way
he might wish, being far too sensible and just a man to endeavour to
make his son suffer financially for his opinions. But James Poyntz
refused money which, as he said, would have been purely superfluous to
him, and was occupied in carving a career for himself at the common-law
bar, where he was already a not inconspicuous figure among the junior
men.

His knowledge of ecclesiastical law was good, and in the wrangles
between diocesan chancellors and recalcitrant clergy which were becoming
more and more frequent, he was frequently retained. He was a very
familiar figure in Dr. Tristram's Consistory Court, and his familiarity
with ecclesiastical litigation only increased a contempt for those who
professed and called themselves Christians, which was as profound as it
was sincere, and as fundamentally the result of ignorance as it was
both.

For, brilliant as he was, the young man had not the slightest
acquaintance with modern religious thought. He saw everything through
the spectacles of temperamental distaste, and still believed that
Professor Huxley had dealt the final blow to Christianity in 1876! Lord
Huddersfield had often pressed his son to read the question as it at
present stood, to see what Gore and the philosophic apologists were
saying, or even to note the cautious but inevitable conclusions that
prominent scientists like Lord Kelvin and Sir Oliver Lodge were arriving
at. But the young man always refused. The ancient indictment of the
Gadarene swine represented the last word in the controversy for him, and
a brain keen and finely furnished with facts on all other questions, on
this was not only content to be forty years behind the conclusions of
theological science, but imagined that it was in the van of contemporary
thought.

Of late, Lord Huddersfield had given up the attempt to influence his
son's opinions. ""It is impossible,"" he had said, ""to explain that the
sky is blue to a man who has blindfolded himself all his life, and one
cannot build a basis in a vacuum."" So, while both men respected each
other's attainments on all subjects but religious ones, on these James
thought his father a fool, and Lord Huddersfield knew that his son was.

Despite all this difference, the younger man was a frequent and welcome
visitor at his father's various houses, and between him and his sister
Agatha there was a real and deep affection. Agatha was conventionally
indifferent to religious things, James was profoundly antagonistic to
them, and thus, if they did not meet quite on common ground, they were
never likely to disagree.

And Lucy Blantyre, the third member of that gay young trio on the summer
morning, was a combination of both of them. She was very well off in the
affairs of this world, as indeed was her brother, Bernard Blantyre of
St. Elwyn's. But, while he had early devoted his life and money to the
service of God, Lucy had refused to identify herself with his interests.
She lived with her aunt, Lady Linquest, a gay old dame of Mayfair, and
it was only at rare intervals that she paid a duty visit to her
brother. Yet, though she was, from a surface point of view, purely a
society girl, popular, and happy in a bright and vivid life, there were
temperamental depths in her, unsounded as yet, which showed her
sometimes--to her own wonder and discomfort--that she was a true
blood-sister to the priest in north-east London. At times, a wave of
scorn for the Church possessed her. She saw the worst side of religious
externals and poured bitter fun upon their anomalies. This is, of
course, a very easy thing to do. Any one can ridicule the unseen and its
ministers: it requires no special talent to be rude to God! At other
times, the girl saw this very clearly and was ashamed. She had a good
brain and despised all that was cheap and vulgar at the bottom; and when
her moods of wilfulness had passed, she stood upon the brink of devotion
and belief.

Nothing serious animated any of the three. The day was wonderful. In a
sky like a hard, hollow sapphire the sun burned like a white-hot disc of
platinum. The island was deliciously cool; the murmur of a near river
mingled with the bourdon of the bees. The smooth turf on which they lay
was starred with chaste and simple flowers.

""Isn't it _perfect_ to-day!"" Agatha said. ""Bee, go away from my face!
'Pleasant it is when the woods are green and the winds are soft and low,
to lie amid some sylvan scene'--Lucy, dear, what are you thinking
about?""

""I was wondering if we were really reclining in what the poets of last
century called 'bosky shade.' Is this bosky, Mr. Poyntz?""

""Decidedly bosky, I should say. But surely both of you can put the
island to a better use than merely to illustrate quotations from the
poets? It's far too fine for that.""

""Oh, do let me have 'bosky',"" Lucy replied. ""It's such a dear, comic
word. I've always loved it. It always seems a fat word to me. I'm sure
it's fat and it waddles--in the word world!""

""Then what does Agatha's 'sylvan' do?""

""Oh, sylvan?--well, I should think it was a slim, graceful, and very
young-ladyish kind of word. It wears a neat grey tailor-made coat and
skirt, and says, 'Papa is of opinion that,' or, 'Mamma has frequently
told me.'""

They all laughed, pleased with themselves, the hour, and the charm that
perfectly absurd talk has for young and happy people.

""Oh, don't talk of words, Miss Blantyre,"" Poyntz said, ""I'm tired of
them. The long vacation draws near, when I want to forget all about
them. My words, the words I live by, or for, are beasts.""

""Quote, dearest,"" Agatha said.

""Well, this is the sort of thing I see more often than anything else at
present,"" he replied: ""'The humble petition of the vicar and
churchwardens of St. Somebody sheweth that, it being considered
desirable to make certain alterations and improvements in the church of
the said Parish, a meeting in Vestry duly convened for considering the
same, was held on the first of June, at which it was resolved that the
alterations shown in the plan annexed hereto and there produced, should
be carried out, a copy of which resolution is also hereto annexed.'""

Both the girls cried out to him to stop.

""What musty words, dry and rusty words!"" Lucy said. ""And, please, what
are they all about, and what do they mean?""

""They mean this--some worthy parson has badgered his congregation for
money. It is the desire of his soul to have a rood-screen in his
chancel, with a gilt and splendid crucifix upon the top. So, armed with
a mouthful of words like that, he gets him to a sort of cellar near St.
Paul's, where a dear old gentleman, named the Right Worshipful T. H.
Tristram, K. C., D.C.L., sits, in a big wig and a red robe. The parson
eloquently explains his wishes, and the Right Worshipful tells him to go
and be hanged--or polite words to that effect. Then I and other young
legal 'gents' get up and talk and argue, and the Right Worshipful
listens until he's tired, and then says no again. The parson goes back
to his roodless temple and preaches against Erastianism, and I and the
other young legal 'gents' pouch a few guineas, and go and play pool at
the Oxford and Cambridge Club.""

""And then,"" Agatha went on,--""then father makes a speech and writes a
letter to the _Times_ and gets fearfully excited and worried for about a
week, neglects his meals, passes sleepless nights, and behaves in a
perfectly foolish manner generally. Then he goes down to the parish and
has a convivial meat tea with the poor parson, and before he goes gives
him a cheque for fifty pounds to go and have a holiday with after all
the strain!""

""Exactly,"" said Lucy, ""I will take up the parable. I have seen our
friend, the parson, in the unutterable north London slum, where my poor
dear brother Bernard spends all his time and money. He goes, as you
say, for a holiday, to recover from the scene in the cellar near St.
Paul's. He goes to Dieppe or Boulogne, where he attends the cathedral
three times a day, and tries to fraternise with the priests, who regard
him as a layman masquerading in borrowed plumes. In revenge, he goes and
makes things uncomfortable for the local English chaplain, who, in most
continental towns, is an undersized person with a red nose and an
enormous red moustache and a strong flavour of Chadband at home. So
'all's well that ends well.' But, really, what fearful nonsense it all
is! Isn't it wonderful that people should waste their energies so!""

""If it amuses them it doesn't matter in the least,"" Agatha said. ""Look
how happy it makes poor dear father. And I daresay he does good in his
way, don't you know. It's far better than racing or anything like that.
Poor dear Hermione Blackbourne was staying here not long ago, and she
was telling me what a wretched time they have at home. Lord Saltire
hardly ever pays the girls' allowances unless he's won a race, and the
poor dears have to study the sporting papers to know if they'll be able
to afford new frocks for Goodwood. Father's fads are at least harmless,
or, at any rate, no one has to suffer for what he gives away.""

""The old type of clergyman seems to have quite died out,"" Lucy said.
""When I was a little girl, the rector at home was a dear old man, who
dressed just like an ordinary person, and went otter-hunting three days
a week. Yet I'm sure he was just as earnest as any of these new faddy
people. We had a delightful old pew, with a fireplace and chairs, and
poor dear father used to get his nap. And as for altar lights and copes
and incense, I don't suppose dear old Mr. Jenkyns had ever heard of such
things. The amount of money that Bernard spends on his church in that
way is ridiculous.""

""The only good I can see in it,"" James Poyntz said, ""is that it brings a
certain colour element into drab and dull lives. The people in your
brother's parish, who never see any thing artistic, must gain in that
way, I suppose. After all, Miss Blantyre, 'it's an ill wind that blows
nobody any good.' All this Church nonsense gives pleasure, however much
we may laugh at it. Take myself, for example. I'm intensely amused at
all the squabbles that go on between Christians. More evil passions are
stirred up and let loose over half a yard of green silk or the precise
manner in which half an ounce of flour and water is baked than the
politics of a century excite! It's perfectly true. There's a spirit of
bitter hatred in it all that is intensely interesting to the student of
character. There are hundreds of thousands of people in England who
would burn my poor father in front of St. Paul's to-morrow if they
could--good, respectable, honest British folk!""

""Well,"" Lucy said, with affected gloom, ""all this only reminds me of my
coming penance. In a day or so now, I must dive into Hornham for my
yearly stay with Bernard. I shall emerge quite thin and crushed. I
always do. The 'clergy-house,' as they call the vicarage, is a
lugubrious place that suggests a rather superior workhouse. When I go,
the drawing-room is solemnly opened by the housekeeper. Bernard gives a
couple of dinner parties and a garden party to a set of the most
extraordinary people you ever saw in your life. I have to be hostess and
chatter to weird people, with whom I haven't a single idea in common.
Lady Linquest drove down from Park Lane to the garden party last year. I
shall never forget it. She gave Bernard such a talking to, told him to
'dress like a gentleman,' and exchange to a nice country parish with
some county people close by, and marry. I wish he would, too! He's
wasting his life, his money, and his health in that awful place. I don't
wonder at aunt's being angry. Why can't he do as she says? He could have
high jinks in a nice little country church in one of the home counties
just as well as where he is now.""

""Beastly life, I should think,"" James Poyntz said. ""Does he live all
alone?""

""Oh, the two curates live with him, Father Stephens and Father
King--they're all 'fathers,' it seems. These are two intense youths, who
dress in cassocks and tippets all day long, and wear their berrettas
everywhere. I think it's positively indecent to sit down to a meal
dressed like that. But the worst of it is, that there's always some fast
day or other, and I feel an awful pig to be having chicken and claret
while the other three have oatmeal and apples. But I insisted on proper
meals last year, much to the disgust of a gaunt old cat of a
housekeeper, whom Bernard thinks the whole world of.""

She stopped, laughing at her own volubility, and lay back upon the
cushions, staring up at the green-leaf canopy above her head. All these
questions seemed very trivial and unreal at that moment, in that
pleasant place of sunshine, soft breezes, and the murmur of falling
water. She thought of the long, mean, suburban streets of Hornham with
humorous dismay. Thank goodness that she was only going to spend a
fortnight there, and then would be away in a gay continental
watering-place with Lady Linquest. But the few days were imperative. She
was fond of her brother and knew how bitterly disappointed he would be
if she were to withdraw from her promise to stay at St. Elwyn's. It was
a duty which must be done, and it was an unkind fate indeed that had
placed her brother in surroundings which were so uncongenial to her, and
endowed him with opinions so alien to her own.

James Poyntz had lighted a cigarette. The smoke curled upwards in
delicate grey spirals, and he could see his sister's friend through
them, surrounded by a shifting frame which cut off the striking and
clever face from its immediate surroundings, giving it a vivid and
independent individuality. He could survey it more completely so. There
was something in Lucy Blantyre that had begun to appeal to the young
man with great and greater strength as the days went on. She was close
upon beauty, and she had all the charm of a high-spirited and well-bred
girl in perfect health, and knowing no trouble in life. But in the life
to which he had been born, girls like her were not uncommon. Despite the
fiction-mongers who fulminate against the vices of ""society,"" and would
have their readers believe that the flower of English girlhood is to be
found in the middle class alone, Poyntz knew many gracious girls who
were worthy to stand by any man's side throughout life. But in Lucy
Blantyre he was beginning to discern something deeper and stronger. He
thought that he saw in her a wonderful capacity for companionship, a
real talent for wifehood. He could imagine that she would be more to her
husband than an ordinary wife, identified with his hopes and career with
all her soul's power, one for whom Milton's epithalamium itself would
not be unworthy, with its splendid ""Hail, wedded love!""

But, though such thoughts had been in and out of his mind for some time,
he was hardly in love with her as yet. His temperament was honest and
sincere, but cool and judicial also. He was the last man to take any
definite step without a full weighing of the chances and results.

But the two had become great friends. Agatha Poyntz had her own thoughts
about the matter, and they were very pleasant ones. Nothing would have
pleased her more than the marriage of her brother and her friend, and
she had made _tête-à-têtes_ for them in the adroit, unobtrusive manner
that girls know.

In all his conversations with Lucy, Poyntz had found a keen, resilient
brain that answered to his thoughts in precisely the way he wished. The
tinge of cynicism in her corresponded to the flavour of it in him, and
there was sometimes real wit and understanding in her mockery.

She ""suited"" him--that is how he would have put it--and he was now
beginning to ask and examine himself if love were not being born, a love
which might make their union a perfect and lasting thing upon his way
through life. Of her sentiments towards him he knew no more than that
she sincerely liked him and that they were friends.

The regular throbbing pant of a steam launch on the silver Thames
outside was heard, and Lucy turned suddenly in Poyntz's direction. She
saw that he was looking at her gravely and steadily. A very faint flush
came into her cheeks, almost imperceptible indeed, and then she smiled
frankly at him.

He smiled also, pleased with himself and her, and with a sense that a
new intimacy was suddenly established between them, an odd sense of
which he was quite certain.

Agatha looked at the little watch in a leather bracelet on her wrist.
""It's nearly lunch time!"" she said; ""I don't know how you people feel,
but the word has a very welcome sound to me. Jim, get up and punt us
home. You'll be able to argue with Father Saltus; I've asked him to
lunch with us to-day. I didn't know you were coming down.""

She spoke of Lord Huddersfield's domestic chaplain, a wise and courtly
elderly man, whom they all liked, without in the least realising the
part he played in Church affairs, regarding him, indeed, as a harmless
student and a pleasant companion, but no more.

In fact, as the light and careless conversation of all of them showed,
not one of the three young people had the remotest idea of what they
were discussing. And though each one of them had a sense of humour, they
were not able to see the humorous side of their airy patronage of the
Catholic Church! This Mr. Saltus was known as one of the most profound
metaphysicians of the day. The greatest modern brains were influenced by
his writings in Christian apologetics; bishops, statesmen, great
scientists knew of him as one to whom it was given to show how all
thought and all philosophy were daily proving the truth of the
Incarnation. His work in the life of the Church was this, and he was
Lord Huddersfield's chaplain because that position gave him leisure and
freedom for his work, and kept him in touch with the very centre of
things.

James Poyntz had arrived from London by an early train, and had joined
the girls at once.

In a moment or two, the young man was propelling the long mahogany punt
with easy strokes towards the artificial cutting which led to the
Seaming boathouse. Then, laughing and talking together, the three
strolled over the wonderful lawns, pneumatic to the tread, brilliant as
emerald to the eye, towards the old house with its encircling oaks and
elms.

The tall red chimneys rose up between the leaves, that triumph of the
Tudor style, which alone of all architectural systems has shown how
chimneys may aid and complete the beauty of a building. The house rested
upon the lawns as if it might float away at any moment, as they passed
round an ancient grey dove-cot and some formal box-trees, and came in
sight of the beautiful place. James Poyntz gave a quick breath of
pleasure as he saw it, the old riverside palace of his ancestors. There
were other houses which would one day be his--a great, grim Yorkshire
fortress, the gay villa at Nice by the old citadel of Mont-Albano, where
the Paglion sings its song of the mountain torrent, the decorous London
mansion in Berkeley Square. But of all, he loved the old Tudor house by
the river best.

How well Lucy walked! her carriage was a pleasure to watch. Yes! she
harmonised with her background, she was in correspondence with her
environment, she would be a fit mistress of Scarning in some dim future
day.

They sat down to lunch in an ancient, mellow room, panelled in oak, with
Tudor roses everywhere. It was beautifully cool and fresh after the
glare outside. Father Saltus was a tall and very portly elderly man. His
head was large, formed on a grand scale, and his mouth powerful but
good-humoured. His eyebrows were very bushy and extremely white, and
they overhung eyes which were of a dark grey, deep but not sombre, with
much that was latent there.

The meal was progressing merrily when the butler entered and spoke to
the footman who had been waiting on them. Then he went up to Agatha.
""His Lordship has returned, Miss,"" he said, ""and will be down to lunch
in a moment.""

Lord Huddersfield had been away for several days. The family house in
London was let, as the Baron did not entertain largely since his wife's
death. Agatha's season was spent under the wing of the St. Justs, her
mother's people. But Lord Huddersfield had chambers in Piccadilly, and
no one ever quite knew whether or not he would be at Scarning at any
given time.

He entered in a moment, a slim, spectacled man, with a short beard, very
quietly dressed, a man who did not, at first glance, in any way suggest
the power he wielded or the strenuous personality he was.

He kissed his daughter, shook hands with his son, Lucy, and the
chaplain, and sat down. They noticed that he was pale and worried.

""Have any of you seen the papers?"" he said in a strong, resonant voice,
which came oddly from a man so ordinary and undistinguished in
appearance.

""I saw the _Times_ this morning, Father,"" Poyntz said, ""but that is
all."" The girls confessed that they had not touched the pile of journals
in the library, and Mr. Saltus said he had been writing letters all the
morning and so had not yet been able to see the news.

""I am sorry,"" said Lord Huddersfield sadly. ""I had hoped that you would
have seen the thing that has happened. I had hoped that I should not
have had to tell you, Miss Blantyre.""

His voice was so charged with meaning that Lucy shivered. Her eyes
became full of apprehension. ""Why me, Lord Huddersfield?"" she said,
""what has happened?""

Agatha, who was thoroughly frightened, laid a sympathetic hand upon her
friend's arm. James, who was gazing anxiously at the girl, suddenly
turned to his father.

""I think you had better tell your news right out,"" he said quietly.
""Don't keep Miss Blantyre in suspense, Father; it is mistaken kindness.
I am sure that she will be brave.""

Every one looked at Lord Huddersfield; the air was tense with
expectation. ""Your good brother, Miss Blantyre,"" the peer began--Lucy
gave a quick gasp and the colour faded from her lips--""your good
brother, yesterday in church, was saying Mass when suddenly some local
residents rose in their places and made an open protest, shouting and
brawling at the very moment of the Prayer of Consecration!""

Lucy gazed steadfastly at him, waiting. He said nothing more. ""Go on,
please,"" she managed to whisper at last.

""They were at once ejected, of course,"" Lord Huddersfield said.

""And Bernard?""

""Although his state of mind must have been terrible, despite his pain, I
learn from a private telegram that he continued the service to the end.""

The three young people stared incredulously; only Father Saltus suddenly
looked very grave.

""But--why--is that all, Lord Huddersfield?"" Lucy said with a gasp of
half-relief. ""I thought you meant that something dreadful had happened
to Bernard.""

""Yes,"" he said, very surprised, ""I have told you.""

James picked up his knife and fork, and continued his lunch without a
word. He was very angry with his father.

Agatha shrugged her shoulders slightly.

""Oh, that wasn't quite fair, Lord Huddersfield,"" Lucy said tremulously.
""You really made me think some awful thing had happened. Only a brawl in
church?""

""I am very sorry, my dear,"" he answered quickly; ""I fear I have shown a
great want of tact. I did not know. I forgot, that is, that you don't
quite see these things as we do. You don't realise what it means.""

""Shall I give you some chicken, Father?"" Agatha said, looking at a dish
of mayonnaise before her. She thought that there had been quite a fuss
made about nothing.

Lord Huddersfield sighed. He felt that he was in a thoroughly
uncongenial atmosphere, though he was sorry for the alarm he had caused.
Once his eye fell in mild wonder upon his guest. How unlike her brother
she was, he thought.

There was an awkward silence, which James broke at length.

""I always thought,"" he said, ""that there would be trouble soon. The days
for locking clergymen up have passed by, but Protestant feeling is bound
to have its outlet.""

His quick brain had seized upon the main point at once.

""Well, there will be more work for the lawyers,"" he continued.

Lord Huddersfield frowned a little. ""Of course, I can't expect you to
see the thing as I do, James,"" he said. ""To me such a public insult to
our Lord is terrible. It almost frightens one. What poor Blantyre must
have felt, what every Catholic there must have felt, is most painful to
imagine.""

""I'm sure Mr. Poyntz has sympathy with any body of people whose most
sacred moment has been roughly disturbed,"" the chaplain said. ""Whatever
a man's convictions may be, he must feel that. But the thing is over and
nothing can put it right. What I fear is, that this is only the
beginning of a series of sacrilegious acts which may do the Church
incalculable harm.""

""The newspaper report, which appeared everywhere but in the _Times_,""
Lord Huddersfield replied, ""stated that it was only the beginning of a
campaign. All the reports were identical and apparently supplied to the
papers by the same person, probably the brawlers themselves--who appear
to be people of no consequence whatever.""

""There will be a service of reparation?"" asked the chaplain.

""Yes, to-morrow,"" answered Lord Huddersfield. ""I am going down to
Hornham and shall be present. We must discuss everything with Blantyre
and settle exactly what lines the _Church Standard_ will take up.""

""Of course, Mr. Blantyre will prosecute?"" James said.

""Oh, yes. My telegram told me that the summons had already been issued.
The law is quite clear, I suppose, on the point, James?""

""Quite. Brawling in church is a grave offence. But these people will, of
course, pose as martyrs. Public opinion will be with them, a nominal
fine will be inflicted, and they'll find themselves heroes. I'm afraid
the Ritualists are going to have a bad time. In '68, the Martin _v._
Mackonochie judgment was very plain, and in '71 the judicial committee
of the Privy Council was plainer still in the case of Herbert _v._
Punchas. Then, after the Public Worship Regulation Act, the Risdale
judgment clinched the whole thing. That was at the beginning of it all.
Now, though prosecutions have been almost discontinued, the few cases
that have been heard before the ecclesiastical courts are all the same.
So far as I can see, if this pleasant little habit of getting up and
brawling protests in church becomes popular, a big fire will be lighted
and the advanced men will have to draw in their horns.""

Lord Huddersfield smiled. He attempted no argument or explanation. He
had thrashed out these questions with his son long ago. Father Saltus
spoke instead.

""If this really spreads into a movement, as it may,"" he said, ""ignorant
public opinion will be with the protestors for a month or two. But that
is all. The man in the street will say that every one has a right to
hold whatever religious opinions he pleases, and to convert others to
his views--if he can--by the ordinary methods of propagandism. But he
will also say that no one has a right to air his opinions by disturbing
the devotions of those who don't happen to agree with him. And what is
more, no religious cause was ever advanced by these means. I have no
doubt that these people will boast and brag that they are vindicating
the cause of law in the Church of England. But if they knew anything of
the history of that Protestantism they champion--which, of course, they
_don't_, for they know nothing whatever--they would know that the law is
the most impotent of all weapons to crush a religious movement.""

James nodded. ""It is a truism of history,"" he agreed.

""Exactly. To call in the aid of the law to counteract the spread of any
religious doctrine or ceremonial is to adopt the precise means that sent
the Oxford martyrs to the stake and lighted the Smithfield fires. From
the days when the High Priests called in the law's aid to nip
Christianity in the bud, the appeal to the law has never been anything
but an appeal to the spirit of intolerance and persecution against the
freedom of religious belief and worship.""

Agatha rose from the table. ""Come along, Lucy dear,"" she said; ""'all's
well that ends well,' and your brother's not going to have a bomb thrown
at him just yet. You will be in the thick of the disturbance in a few
days; meanwhile, make the most of the river and the sunshine! Jim, come
and punt us to the Eyot.""

She kissed her father and fluttered away singing happily a snatch of an
old song, _Green Grow the Rushes O!_

The others followed her. The two elder men were left alone, and for a
minute or two neither spoke.

Then Saltus said: ""They are all young, they have made no contact with
real life yet. God does not always call in early life. To some people,
the cross that is set so high over the world is like a great star,--it
is not seen until the surrounding sky is darkened and the sun grows
dim.""

""I am going into the chapel,"" Lord Huddersfield said, ""to be alone for
an hour. There must be many prayers going up to-day to God for the wrong
these poor ignorant men have done.""

""Pray that they may be forgiven. And then, my dear Lord,"" he continued,
""suppose we have a talk over the situation that has been created--if any
situation beyond the purely local one _has_ been created."" A fighting
look came into his face. ""We shall be wise to be prepared, to have our
guns loaded.""

""Yes, Father,"" Lord Huddersfield said rather grimly, ""we are not without
power and influence, I am happy to think.""




CHAPTER IV

LUCY BLANTYRE AT THE CLERGY-HOUSE


Lucy Blantyre left Scarning Court on Thursday morning. James Poyntz
travelled up to town with her. She was to go home to Park Lane for an
hour or two, make one of the guests at a lunch party with Lady Linquest,
and then, in the afternoon, drive down to Hornham.

She was alone in a first-class carriage with James during the whole of
the journey to London. The last three days had marked a stage in their
intercourse. Both of them were perfectly aware of that. Intimacy between
a young man and a girl is very rarely a stationary thing. It progresses
in one direction or another. James began to talk much of his ambitions.
He told her how he meant to carve his way in the world, the place he
meant to take. The Poyntz family was a long-lived one; Lord Huddersfield
himself was only middle-aged, and might live another thirty years. James
hoped that it would be so.

""I want to win my own way by myself,"" he said. ""I hope the title will
not come for many years. It would mean extinction if it came now. You
sympathise with that, don't you?""

She was very kind to him. Her answers showed a real interest in his
confidences, but more than that. There was acumen and shrewdness in
them.

""You know,"" he said, ""I do hate and detest the way the ordinary young
man in my position lives. It is so futile and silly. I recognised it
even at Oxford. Because of one's father, one was expected to be a silly
fool and do no work. Of course, there were some decent fellows,--Dover,
the Duke of Dover, was quiet and thought about things. But all my
friends were drawn from the social class which people suppose to be just
below our own, the upper middle class. It's the backbone of England. Men
in it take life seriously.""

He stopped after a time, and gazed out of the window at the flying
landscape. Suddenly he turned to her. ""I'm so glad you are my sister's
great friend, Lucy,"" he said.

It was the first time that he had spoken her first name to her. His tone
was charged with meaning.

She looked up quickly, and saw that his eyes were fixed upon her.

""You are all very kind to me,"" she said.

""Every one would be kind to you. I have been very happy since you have
let me be your friend. Do you know that my work and my hopes seem dearer
than ever to me now that I have told you so much of them. We have got to
know each other very well, haven't we?""

""Very well.""

""We shall know each other better. It is my hope. I wonder if I might
write to you now and then, and tell you some of my thoughts and how
things are with me? Would such letters bore you?""

""I should value them, and think them a privilege. A woman is always
gratified when a man confides his thoughts to her. So many men never
allow a woman friend to see below the surface, and so many men--at any
rate, men that I am in the way of meeting--have no thoughts to tell one
even if they would.""

The train began to go more slowly as it rumbled through the dingy
environs, and shook over the myriad points of Waterloo Station. Neither
of them spoke again. There was no doubt in the mind of either as to the
meaning of the situation.

The girl had gathered all his thoughts from his tone. It was very
pleasant to be with him, this sane and brilliant young man with a great
name and such powers. It made her happy to know how he regarded
her--that out of all the girls he knew he had chosen her for a friend.
He would some day ask her to be something more; that also she knew, and
knew that he was conveying it to her. She did not love him, love was a
word not very real to her as yet. Her mental eyes had never visualised
it, it was an abstraction. But she liked and admired him more than any
other man of her set: he was a _man_. Well, there was time enough yet to
think of all that. Meanwhile his deference was sweet; her heart warmed
to him as his, she knew, was warm to her at that moment.

He saw her to the door of the waiting victoria, and stood chatting for a
moment in the hurry of the station, making the footman mount his box
again.

Then he gave the signal to start, and stood upon the platform by his
hansom as she was driven rapidly away. Once she turned and waved a hand
to him.

Lucy lay back in the carriage, pleased with herself and all the world.
She had come on to Victoria, instead of getting out at Vauxhall,
specially to enjoy the longer drive. It was a brilliant day, and as the
carriage came upon Waterloo Bridge, the wonderful panorama of riverside
London was uplifting. Away to her right, the purple dome of St. Paul's
shone white-grey in the sun. The great river glittered in the morning
air, and busy craft moved up and down the tide. The mammoth buildings of
the embankment, Somerset House with its noble façade, the Savoy, the
monster Cecil, the tiled roofs of Scotland Yard all came to the eye in
one majestic sweep of form and colour. And far away to the left, dim in
a haze of light, the towers of Westminster rose like a fairy palace,
tipped with flame as the sun caught the gold upon the vanes and spires.

London! yes! it was, after all, the most beautiful city in the world,
seen thus, at this hour, from this place. How the heart quickened and
warmed to it.

Suddenly the thought of Hornham came to her. She made a little
involuntary movement of disgust. For a whole fortnight she would be
there. It would be intolerable. Why could not Bernard come to Park Lane
for a fortnight? How much more sensible that would be.

Well, it was no good thinking of it. The thing must be done. Yet, from
one point of view how curious it was. How strange that a drive of two
hours would plunge her into a world entirely foreign and alien in every
way to her world.

She was driving up Grosvenor Place now, by the long walls of the King's
Palace Garden, over which the trees showed fresh and green. The stately
street, with the Park gates at the end of its vista, only accentuated
the contrast. She utterly failed to understand how any one could do what
her brother did. There was not the slightest reason for the endurance of
these horrors. His personal income was large, his family connections
were influential. He could obtain a fashionable West End living without
any trouble. She was still scornfully wondering as the carriage stopped
at Lady Linquest's house in Park Lane.

Lucy found her aunt in a little room of china-blue and canary-yellow
which looked out over the Park.

She was a tall woman, of full figure. The face was bright and animated,
though somewhat sensual, inasmuch as it showed that its owner
appreciated the good material things that life has to offer. At
sixty-two, when dames of the middle classes have silver hair and are
beginning to assume the gentle manners of age, Lady Linquest wore the
high curled fringe of the fashion, a mass of dark red hair that had
started life upon the head of a Bréton peasant girl. Art had been at
work upon her face and she was pleasant to look on, an artificial
product indeed, but with all the charm that a perfect work of art has.

She made no secret of it to her intimate friends, and no one thought any
the worse of her in a society where nearly every one who has need of
aids to good looks buys them in Bond Street. Indeed, she was quite
unable to understand what she called ""the middle class horror of paint.""
""Why on earth,"" she would say, ""any one can possibly object to an old
woman making herself look as pleasant as possible for the last few years
of her life, I can't make out. It's a duty one owes to one's friends. It
sweetens life. At any rate, _I_ don't intend to go about like old Mother
Hubbard or the witch in whatshername.""

""Lucy, my dear,"" said this vivacious dame as her niece entered, ""you're
looking your best this morning. And when you look your best my
experience generally tells me that you've been up to some wickedness or
other! How's Agatha, and has James Poyntz been at Scarning, and how's
that poor dear man, Huddersfield, who always reminds me of a
churchwarden? He is the king of all the churchwardens in England, I
think.""

Lucy sat down and endeavoured to answer the flood of questions as
satisfactorily as might be, while Lady Linquest took her mid-morning
pick-me-up of Liebig and cognac.

The good lady gave her niece a rapid _précis_ of the news of their set
during the few days she had been away. ""So that you'll know,"" she said,
""what to talk about at General Pompe's lunch--your last decent meal, by
the way, for a fortnight! I shall give orders to the cook to put a
hamper in the carriage for you to take with you to Bernard's. All those
poor young men starve themselves.""

She rattled away thus while Lucy went to her own room to dress. For some
reason or other, why she could not exactly divine, she was dissatisfied
and ill at ease. The exhilaration of the railway journey, of the
wonderful drive through sunlit London, had gone. Her aunt, kind
creature as she was, jarred upon her this morning. How terribly shallow
the good lady seemed, after all! She was like some gaudy fly dancing
over a sunlit brook--or even circling round malodorous farmyard
stuff--brilliant, useless, and with nothing inside but the mere muscles
of its activity. James Poyntz's words recurred to her, his deep scorn of
a purely frivolous, pleasure-loving life was present in her brain.

Lucy was genuinely fond of Lady Linquest, but somehow on this bright
morning to hear a woman with one foot in the grave talking nothing but
scandal and empty catchwords of Vanity Fair, struck with a certain chill
to her heart.

To see her sitting there, curled, painted, scented, sipping her tonic
drink, ready for a smart party of people as empty and useless as
herself, was to see a thing that hurt, after the experiences of the
morning.

Lucy had not taken her maid to Scarning. She had wanted to live as
simply as possible there, to live the outdoors riverside life. And she
was not going to take Angelique to Hornham either--where the girl would
be miserable and a nuisance to the grave little community there. She
felt very glad, as the chattering little French woman helped her to
dress, that she was not coming with her. The maid's voluble boulevard
French got on her nerves; the powder on her face, which showed violet in
the sunlight, the strong scent of verbena she wore, the expression of
being abnormally ""aware""--all these were foreign to Lucy's mood, and she
noticed them with an almost physical sense of disapproval that she had
never before felt so strongly.

The drive to the smart hotel near Piccadilly only took five or six
minutes, and the two ladies were soon shaking hands with old General
Pompe, their host. General the Hon. Reginald Pompe was an old creature
who was only kept from senile decay by his stays. He was unmarried,
extremely wealthy, and the fashion. In his younger days, his life had
been abominable; now, his age allowed him to do nothing but lick the
chops of vicious memories and prick his ears for scandals in which he
could not share. People said, ""Old General Pompe is really _too_ bad,
but where one sees the Duke of ---- and the Prince of ---- we may be
sure that people like ourselves cannot be far wrong.""

The other guests comprised Lord Rollington, of whom there was nothing to
be said save that he was twenty-four and a fool; Gerald Duveen, who was
a fat man of good family, and more or less of a success upon the stage;
and his beautiful, bold-looking wife, a judge's daughter, who played
under the name of Miss Mary Horne, and of whom much scandal was
whispered.

After a moment or two in the palm room, waiting for the Duveens, who
were a minute or two late, the six people went in to lunch. The special
table General Pompe always used was reserved for them, decorated with a
triumphant scheme of orchids and violets. Lumps of ice were hidden among
the masses of flowers, diffusing an admirable coolness round the table.

The host drew attention to the menu, which he had composed. He mumbled
over it, and as he bent his head Lucy saw that his ears were quite
pointed, and that the skin upon his neck lay in pachydermatous folds,
dry and yellowish.

""Baked red snapper, red wine sauce,"" said Mr. Duveen, with the purring
and very distinct voice of high comedy. ""Hm--turtle steaks
_miroton_--sweetbreads--_Tadema_, quite the best way to do sweetbreads.""

Mrs. Duveen was talking in a low, rapid voice to Lady Linquest. Her
eyes were very bright, and malice lurked in the curves of a lovely mouth
as she retailed some story of iniquity in high places, one of these
private and intimate scandals in which the half-life of the stage is so
rich--actors and actresses more than most people being able to see
humanity with the mask off. How greedy the three men looked, Lucy
thought, as they devoured the lunch in prospect. ""Pigs!"" she said to
herself with a little inward shudder.

Why was this? She had been at dozens of these functions before now and
had thought none of these thoughts. To-day a veil seemed removed from
her eyes: she saw things as they really were. And as they really were,
these people were abominable.

Any of them would

    ""Buy a minute's mirth to wail a week,
    And sell eternity to gain a toy.""

They had the manners of organ-grinders and the morals of monkeys. She
caught some words of what Mrs. Duveen was saying now and again. Lord
Rollington began to tell her, with affected disgust, how he had been at
a burlesque theatre the night before, and the musical-comedy heroine of
the hour had been so intoxicated that she could hardly sing her song.

""Too bad, you know, Miss Blantyre. I spotted it at once. It's always
disgustin' to see a girl take too much to drink, but when she's caperin'
about the stage like that one really has a right to complain. Don't you
think so? Now, if it had been a poor little chorus girl, she'd have been
fired out of the theatre in a second. For my part, I--"" and so on for an
interminable five minutes.

General Pompe began to flirt with Lucy in that elderly
""you-are-only-a-little-girl"" sort of manner, that is so difficult to
repel and which is so offensive. She saw his horny eyes roving over her
person with appreciation.

A great many of Lady Linquest's particular set were like this. Not all
of them, thank goodness, but so very many! And the worst of it was that
society mingled and overlapped so strangely. The sheep and the goats
were not separated in any way. People like the Huddersfields stood
almost alone, and even Agatha, when she was with the St. Justs--her
mother's family--constantly met this sort of people. But, then, Agatha
didn't seem to care, she didn't realise. She laughed at everything and
thought it ""awfully good fun."" In fact, Lucy realised Agatha was
exactly the same as she herself had always been--with the very slightest
intervals--until this moment. It was startling to think that the words
of Lord Huddersfield's son had worked this revolution in her point of
view. For she was quite persuaded that they were the reason of it. She
could find no other reason.

She did not realise then, as she was to realise with humble thankfulness
and awe in the future, the august influence that was at work within her.

She was not gay at lunch. Usually she was a most welcome member of any
such gathering as this. Her sayings were pointed, she entered fully into
the spirit of the hour, her wit adorned the charm of her personality,
and she was universally popular and voted ""good fun"" in the
comprehensive epitome of her associates. This was the highest praise
they knew, and they gave it her without stint.

To-day the party fell flat--there was no doubt about it. The radiance of
the early morning had given place to a heat which became terribly
oppressive, and the sky was overclouded. Thunder was in the air, and
London awaited a storm.

The electric lights began to glow in the restaurant.

Lady Linquest did her best to rouse her niece to gaiety, but her efforts
were futile. The old man who was entertaining them grew sulky, and Lord
Rollington drank glass after glass of champagne. The beautiful actress
was frankly bored, and became more cynical and bitter with every
scandalous story she told.

Only Mr. Duveen preserved his equanimity. He ate and drank and purred
with secure complaisance. It was his rôle in life. Ever since he had
been a little lick-trencher fag at Eton he had been thus. It was said by
his friends in society--after his back was turned--that on one occasion,
having discovered the Earl of ---- kissing his wife, he had murmured an
apology, saying that he had come to find his cigarette case, and
hurriedly retired from the room. This, no doubt, was scandal and untrue,
but it showed the estimation in which he was generally held.

Lucy knew this unpleasant story--Lady Linquest had told her. She thought
of it as she watched the man pouring _mandarin_ into his coffee. Once
more she felt the shrinking and repulsion that had come over her more
than three hours ago.

She knew, or once had known, her Dante. She had had but little time for
anything but frothy reading during the last year or two, but once she
had kept up her Italian. A passage from the _Inferno_ came into her
brain now,--a long-forgotten passage:

    ""Quest i non hanno speranza di morte,
      E la lor cicca vita è tanto bassa
    Che invidiosi son d'ogni altra sorte.""

She saw the people of whom the Florentine spoke before her now, the
people for whom the bitterest fate of all had been reserved,--these who
""have no hope of death, and whose blind life so meanly drags that they
are envious of every other fate.""

Before she left Park Lane, it had been arranged that the small brougham
should call for her at the restaurant, and take her on to Hornham. Her
luggage was small. This smart society girl was going to take her plunge
into the great London _Hinterland_ with a single trunk, like any little
governess driving to her new situation, where she would learn how bitter
the bread of another may taste, and how steep are the stairs in the
house of a stranger.

The carriage arrived just as lunch was over, and she left all of them
with immeasurable relief.

Driving up Shaftesbury Avenue to find her northward route was like
driving into a black curtain. It was terribly hot and dark, the horses
were uneasy, and the people moving on the pavements seemed like phantoms
in some city of dreadful night.

London began to grip and hold her then as it had never done before. Seen
under this pall, its immensity and the dignity it gained by that was
revealed in a new aspect. _Her_ London, her corner of the town, the mere
pleasure-city, became of no consequence, its luxury, its parks and
palaces, shrank and dwindled to nothing in her consciousness.

She was attuned to thoughts more solemn than were wont to have their way
with her. Her eyes and ears were opened to the reality of life.

She had lost her dislike for the visit she was going to pay. Below her
frequent irritation at her brother's way of life there had always been a
strong affection for him. And more than that, she had always respected
him, though often enough she would not admit it even to herself. As the
brougham turned into the surging arcana at Islington her curiosity
about the next few days was quickened: the thought of personal
discomfort--discomfort of a physical kind--had quite gone. She felt that
she was about to have experience of something new, her pulses quickened
to it.

The vicarage of St. Elwyn's was one of those stately old red-brick
houses, enclosed in a walled garden of not inconsiderable extent, that
are still to be found here and there in north London. They date from the
florid Georgian times, when that part was a spacious countryside where
wealthy merchants withdrew from commerce in the evening of their days
and lived a decorous life among the fields and trees. Here and there, in
the vast overgrown and congested districts, one or another of these old
freeholds has been preserved inviolate--as may be seen in the ride from
Hackney to Edmonton--and becomes an alien in a wilderness of mean little
houses and vulgar streets.

Father Blantyre had bought one of these few remaining mansions in
Hornham, at a high price, and had presented it to the parish of St.
Elwyn's as its vicarage. Here he lived with his two curates and a staff
of four servants,--a housekeeper, two maids, and a man-of-all-work. The
personal wants of the three clergymen were very simple, but the servants
were useful in many parochial affairs. In times when work was scarce,
the vicarage staff boiled soup, like any cheap restaurant-keeper. The
house was open at all times of the day or night to people who wanted to
be quiet and alone for a time; social clubs and guilds had their
headquarters there.

Indeed, the place was the centre of a diversified and complex life--how
complex, neither Lucy, nor any outsider, had the least conception.

The carriage stopped at the heavy square porch with its flight of steps,
and the footman ran up them and rang the bell.

Lucy noticed with amusement that the man's face expressed a mild wonder
at the neighbourhood in which he found himself, and that he winked
solemnly at the coachman on his box.

Lucy stood on the steps for a moment. The sky was quite dark, and the
little side street in which she was, showed in a dim and sulphurous
half-light--like the light round the House of Usher. A piano-organ close
by was beating out its vibrant mechanical music with an incongruous and
almost vulgar disregard of the menace of the heavens.

The housekeeper opened the front door, and Lucy entered a big panelled
hall, now in a gloom that was almost profound, and with a tiled floor
that clicked and echoed as the high heels of her shoes struck upon it.

""The vicar is in his study, Miss,"" the housekeeper said. She was a tall,
gaunt, elderly woman, with a face that always reminded Lucy of a horse,
and her voice was dry and hesitating.

Lucy crossed the hall, opened a door of oak and another of green baize,
and entered her brother's room.

It was a large, lofty place. The walls were covered with books in sober
bindings,--there must have been several thousands there. A soft carpet
covered the floor, in the centre of which stood an enormous
writing-table crowded with books and papers.

Hardly any light came into the place through the long window, and two
candles in massive silver holders stood upon the writing-table, throwing
a soft radiance around.

The light fell upon a tall crucifix of silver that stood upon the table,
a beautiful specimen of English Pre-Reformation work. A small couch had
been drawn up close to the table, and on it the priest lay asleep. The
face was lined and drawn with worry and with work, and all its secrets
were told as the man slept. One hand lay hanging from the side of the
sofa--a lean, strong hand, with a coil of muscle upon the back. Seen
thus in an abandonment of repose, Lucy's brother showed as a man worn
and weary with battle, scarred and battered, bruised, but how
irrevocably rich!

A rush of tenderness came over the girl as she looked at him. Here was
the man who had not winced or cried aloud, whose spirit was unbowed
beneath the bludgeonings of life.

A high serenity lay over the pain upon the face. It was a face vowed, a
saint's face, and even as he slept the great soul which shone like a
monstrance within him, irradiated the mask that hid it.

Lucy saw all this, received some such impressions as those in two or
three moments. Some attraction drew her eyes from the sleeper to the
shining symbol of God's pain upon the table. Then they went back to
Bernard Blantyre. To her excited fancy there seemed some subtle sympathy
between them, an invisible shuttle that was flying to and fro.

Then Blantyre awoke and saw her. He did not come from the kingdom of
sleep gradually, as most people do, loath to leave those silent halls.
He sprang suddenly into full consciousness, as soldiers upon fields of
battle, as old veterans used to sudden drums and tramplings are known to
do.

His eyes lighted up with merriment and triumph, his mobile face was one
great smile. He caught her by the arms and kissed her repeatedly. ""It's
splendid to have you again, me darling,"" he said, with a slight Irish
accent that came to both of them when they were excited. ""Ye little
wretch, staying away so long! Why, ye're prettier than ever! Ye'll have
all the Hornham boys waiting for ye outside the church door after Mass,
for we don't see your sort down our humble way--the rale West End
product!""

Laughing and chattering, putting on the most exaggerated brogue, the
brother and sister moved out into the hall. Father Blantyre called
loudly, ""King! Stephens! where are ye? she's come!--I don't know where
my boys are at all, mavourneen--We'll dress um down for not being in to
welcome the new clergywoman. Now, come up to your room, sweetheart, and
Bob'll bring your box up. Bob! bring me sister's trunk up-stairs.""

The little man ran up the wide stairway, an odd, active figure in his
black cassock, laughing and shouting in an ecstasy of pleasure and
excitement. No schoolboy could have been more merry, more full of simple
joy.

Lucy followed him, half laughing, half inclined to sob at this happy
welcome. She was carried off her feet by it all, by this strange arrival
under lurid skies at the dingy old house which suddenly seemed so
home-like.

Reproach filled her heart at her long neglect as she heard her brother's
joy. Simplicity!--yes, that was it. He was utterly simple. The thought
of the people she had left so short a time ago was more odious than
ever.

She found herself alone in her bedroom, a big, gloomy place with solid
mahogany furniture in the old style. There was nothing modern there save
a little _prie-dieu_ of oak by the bedside. But the sober colours and
outmoded massiveness of it all no longer troubled her. She did not give
a single thought to her own luxurious nest in Park Lane--as she had done
so often during her first visit to St. Elwyn's a year ago.

When she went down-stairs once more, both the assistant priests had come
in and were waiting with the vicar in the study, where some tea was
presently brought.

Stephens was a tall, youthful-looking man, rather slangy perhaps, with a
good deal of the undergraduate about him still, but obviously in
earnest. King was square-faced; the clean-shaved jaw showed powerful and
had a flavour of the prize-fighter about it, while his general
expression was grim and somewhat forbidding. He was much the elder of
the two. His expression, the outward shell, was no index to the man
within. A tenderer heart never beat in a man; a person more
temperamentally kind never lived. But he had more capacity for anger,
righteous anger, than either the vicar or Stephens. There were moments
when he could be terrible, and some savage strain in him leaped to the
surface and was only curbed by a will which had long been sanctified to
good.

The two men seemed glad to see Lucy again. She had seen little of them
on her first visit; neither of them had made any impression on her. Now
they interested her at once.

""Now, then, Bernard,"" Lucy said as she began to pour out the tea, ""what
is all this I hear about a scene in church? Lord Huddersfield was full
of it. He was most distressed.""

""He has been awfully good about it,"" Blantyre said. ""He was down here on
Tuesday morning going into the matter. A man named Hamlyn, the editor of
a little local paper, threw the church into a miserable state of
confusion during Mass last Sunday, just after I had said the Prayer of
Consecration. He read a document protesting against the Blessed
Sacrament. We had him ejected, and yesterday he was fined ten shillings
in the local police court. The magistrate, who is a pronounced
Protestant in his sympathies, said that though the defendant had
doubtless acted with the best intentions, one must not combat one
illegality with another, and that the law provided methods for the
regulation of worship other than protests during its process!""

""Pompous old ass!"" said Stephens.

""Well, I'm glad they fined him,"" Lucy said.

""'All's well that ends well!' You won't have the services disturbed
again.""

""On the contrary, dear, we are all very much afraid that this is the
first spark of a big fire. We hear rumours of an organised movement
which may be widely taken up by the enemies of the Church. All through
the ranks there's a feeling of uneasiness. Lord Huddersfield is working
night and day to warn the clergy and prepare them. We cannot say how it
will end.""

He spoke with gravity and seriousness. Lucy, who privately thought the
whole thing a ridiculous storm in a teacup, and was utterly ignorant of
the points at issue, looked sympathetic, but said nothing. She was not
in a flippant mood; she realised she was quite an outsider in the
matter, which seemed so momentous to the three intelligent men she was
with, and, unwilling to betray her lack of comprehension or to say
anything that would jar, she kept a discreet silence.

""We all get shouted after already, when we go into the worst parts of
the parish,"" said Stephens cheerfully. ""They've been rousing the
hooligan element. It's an old trick. Lazy bounders, who don't know a
Christian from a Jew and have never been in a church in their lives,
shout 'papist' after us as we go into the houses. Just before I came in,
I was walking up the street when a small and very filthy urchin put his
head round the corner of a house and squeaked out, 'Oo kissed ve Pope's
toe?' Then he turned and ran for dear life. As yet, I haven't been
assaulted, but King has! Haven't you, King?""

Mr. King looked rather like a bashful bulldog, and endeavoured to change
the subject.

""Do you mean any one actually struck you, Mr. King?"" Lucy said,
absolutely bewildered. ""How awful! But why should any one want to do
that?""

The vicar broke in with a broad grin that made his likeness to a
comedian more apparent than ever.

""Oh, King was splendid!"" he said with a chuckle. ""That ended very well.
A big navvy chap was coming out of a public-house just as King was
passing. He looked round at his friends and called out something to the
effect that here was another monkey in petticoats--we wear our cassocks
in the streets--and see how he'd do for um! So he gave poor King a clout
on the side of the head.""

""Oh, I _am_ sorry,"" Lucy said, looking with interest upon the priest,
and realising dimly that to be a clergyman in Hornham apparently ranked
as one of the dangerous trades. ""What did you do, Mr. King?""

King flushed a little and looked singularly foolish. He was a bashful
man with ladies,--they did not come much into his pastoral way.

Lucy thought that the poor fellow had probably run away and wished that
she had not asked such an awkward question.

""Oh, he won't tell ye, my dear!"" Blantyre said, ""but I will. When the
gentleman smacked um on the cheek, he turned the other to him and kept's
hands behind's back. Then the hero smacked that cheek too. 'Hurroo!'
says King, or words to that effect, 'now I've fulfilled me duty to me
religion and kept to the words of Scripture. And now, me friend, I'm
going to do me duty to me neighbour and thrash ye till ye can't see out
of your eyes.' With that he stepped up to um and knocked um down, and
when he got up, he knocked um down again!""

Mr. King fidgeted uneasily in his seat. ""I thought it was the wisest
thing to do,"" he said, apologetically. ""You see, it would stop anything
of the sort for the future!""

""And the fun of the whole thing, Miss Blantyre,"" Stephens broke in, ""was
that I came along soon after and found the poor wretch senseless--King's
got a fist like a hammer. So we got him up and refused to charge him to
the policeman who turned up after it was all over, and we brought him
here. We sponged him and mended him and fed him, and he turned out no
end of a good sort when the drink was out of him. Poor chap gets work
when he can, hasn't a friend in the world; hadn't any clothes or
possessions but what he stood up in, and was utterly a waster and
uncared for. We asked him if he knew what a papist was, and found he
hadn't an idea, only he thought that they made love to workingmen's
wives when their husbands were at work! He'd been listening to our
friend, Mr. Hamlyn, who called a mass-meeting after the police-court
proceedings and lectured on the three men of sin at the vicarage!""

A flood of strange and startling ideas poured into the girl's brain. A
new side of life, a fourth dimension, was beginning to be revealed to
her. She looked wonderingly at the three men in their long cassocks; she
felt she was in the presence of power. She had felt that when James
Poyntz was talking to her in the train, in the fresh, sunlit morning,
which seemed a thing of the remotest past now. Yet this afternoon she
felt it more poignantly than before. Things were going on down here, in
this odd corner of London, that were startling in their newness.

""And what happened to the poor man?"" she said at length.

""Oh,"" answered the vicar, ""very fortunately we are without a man of all
work just now, so we took him on. He carried your trunk up-stairs. He's
wearing Stephen's trousers, which are much too tight for um! and an old
flannel tennis coat of King's--till we can get his new clothes made. He
was in rags!""

""But surely that's rather risky,"" Lucy said in some alarm. ""And what
about the other servants? I shouldn't think Miss Cass liked it much!""

Miss Cass was the housekeeper, the woman with the face like a horse. She
always repelled Lucy, who, for no reason than the old, stupid ""Dr. Fell""
reason, disliked her heartily.

To her great surprise, she saw three faces turned towards her suddenly.
On each was an expression of blank surprise, exactly the same
expression. Lucy wanted to laugh; the three men were as alike as
children are when a conjuror has just made the pudding in the hat or
triumphantly demonstrated the disappearing egg.

The taciturn King spoke first. ""I forgot,"" he said; ""of course you don't
know anything about Miss Cass. How should you, indeed! Miss Cass is a
saint.""

He said it quite simply, with a little pride, possibly, that the
vicarage which housed him housed a saint, too, but that was all.

""Yes,"" the vicar said, his brogue dropping away from him, as it always
did when he was serious, ""Miss Cass is a saint. I'll tell you her story
some time while you're here, dear. It is a noble story. But don't you be
alarmed about our new importation. Bob will be all right. We know what
we are doing here.""

""It's wonderful, Miss Blantyre,"" Stephens broke out, his boyish face all
lighted up with enthusiasm. ""You know, Bob'd actually never been in
church before yesterday morning, when he came to Mass.""

He stopped for a moment, out of breath in his eagerness. Lucy saw that
he--indeed, all of them--took it quite for granted that these things
they spoke of had supreme interest for her as for them. There was such
absolute _conviction_ that these things were the only important things,
that no excuse or apology was necessary in speaking of them. She found
she liked that, she liked it already. There was a magnetism in these
men that drew her within their circle. She saw that, whatever else they
were, they were absolutely consistent. They did not have one eye on
convention and the world, like the West End clergymen she knew,--some of
them at least. These men lived for one aim, one end, with tremendous
force and purpose. They simply disregarded everything else. Nothing else
occurred! Yes, this was a fourth dimension indeed. She bent herself to
listen to the boy's story, marking, with a pleasure that had something
maternal in it, the vividness and reality of his interest and hopes.

""Before he went,"" the young man said, ""I explained the Church's teaching
exactly to him. Don't forget that the poor chap hadn't the slightest
idea of anything of the sort. He was astounded. A mystery that I could
not explain to him, a mystery for which there were no _material_
evidences at all, came home to him at once. _I saw faith born._ And they
say this is not an age of miracles! Think of the tremendous revolution
in the man's mind. He talked to me after the service. It was all
wonderfully real to him. He was absolutely convinced of the coming of
our Lord. There isn't a rationalist in London that could shake the
man's belief. I asked him why he was so sure--was it merely because I
had told him, because I believed in it? His answer was singularly
touching. 'Nah,' he said, scratching his head,--they all do when they
try to think,--'It wasn't wot you said, guvnor, it was wot I _felt_. I
_knowed_ as 'E wos there. Why, I ses to myself, _It's true!_'""

""It is very wonderful,"" Lucy said. ""It's more wonderful by far than a
man at a Salvation Army meeting or a revival. One can understand that
the sudden shouts and the trumpets and banners and things would
influence any one. But that a service which is inexplicable even to the
people who conduct it should influence this poor uneducated man is
strange.""

""Now, I don't think it strange, Lucy, dear,"" the vicar said; ""it's far
more natural to me than the other. The wonderful power of the Church
lies in this, _that her mysteries appeal to quite simple people whose
minds are a blank on religious questions. They appeal to the simple
instantly and triumphantly._ They feel the power of the Blessed
Sacrament. And _only_ Catholicism can do this in full and satisfying
measure. We find that over and over again. The jam-and-glory teas, the
kiss-in-the-ring revivals, have a momentary and hysterical influence
with the irreligious. But it doesn't last, there is no system or
discipline, and above all, _there is no dignity_. Only priests realise
thoroughly how the poorer and less-educated classes crave for the proper
dignity and beauty of worship. It has always been so. It is the secret
of the power that the Roman Church has over the minds of men.""

""Then why are there so many Salvationists and Dissenters?"" Lucy asked.

""For a multitude of reasons. A dislike to discipline chiefly. People
don't go to church because the novelties of thirty or forty years ago
have filtered down into the omnibuses and people who are naturally
irreligious prefer to make a comfortable little code for themselves. The
Church says you _must not_ do this or that; its rules are thoroughly
well defined. Folk are afraid to come as near to God as the Church
brings them. Their cry is always that the Church comes between them and
God. Often that is a malevolent cry, and more often still it's pure
ignorance. The silly people haven't an idea what they're talking about.
It would be just as reasonable for me to say, 'I hate and abominate
Nicaragua, which is a pernicious and soul-destroying place,' when I've
never been nearer to Nicaragua than Penzance.""

""There is one thing that we do see,"" King continued in his slow,
powerful way. ""Whenever we have open-minded men or women come to church
to pray and find help, they find it. Dozens and dozens of people have
come to me after they have become members of the Church and said that
they could not understand the anti-Church nonsense they themselves had
joined in before. '_We never knew_,' that is the cry always.""

""The thunder's beginning!"" Father Blantyre said suddenly, realising
apparently that the talk was straying into channels somewhat alien to a
young society lady presiding at afternoon tea.

""Lucy, me dear, it's tired you'll be of sitting with three blathering
old priests talking shop in a thunderstorm--there's a flash for ye!""

A sheet of brilliant steel-blue had flashed into the room as he spoke,
showing every detail of it clear and distinct as in some lurid day of
the underworld. The books, the writing table, the faces of the three
clergymen, and the tall silver crucifix between the candles, which had
momentarily faded to a dull and muddy yellow, all made a sudden tableau
which burned itself upon the retina. Then came darkness once more and
the giant stammer of the thunder far overhead.

The thunder ceased and they waited, expectant of the next explosion,
when the penetrating and regular beating of an adjacent bell was heard.

""There's the bell for evensong!"" Blantyre said; ""I did not know it was
so late."" He put on his berretta and left the room, the other men
following him. Lucy rose also. She felt that she would make one of them,
and going up-stairs to get a hat, she presently found herself in the
long, covered passage that connected the vicarage with the church.

The idea of a house which was but an appanage of the church was new to
her. The passage had been built since her last visit. And as she entered
the huge, dim building, she saw clearly how powerful in the minds of her
brother and his friends its nearness must be. All their life, their
whole life, centred in this church. Its services were as frequent and
natural as their daily food. How strangely different it all was to the
life of the outside world! She herself had not been to church for six
weeks or more. Even people who ""called themselves Christians"" only
entered a pew and enjoyed a hebdomadal siesta in church. But these men
could not get on without it. Every thought and action was in communion
with the Unseen. And she was forced to acknowledge it to herself,--if
one actually did believe in a future life, in eternity, then this was
the only logical way in which to prepare for it. If life was really like
a sojourn of one night in an inn, then the traveller who made no
preparation for the journey, and spent the night in careless disregard
of the day, was an utter fool. But no one called worldly people
fools!--it was all very puzzling and worrying, and common-sense did not
seem like common-sense in Hornham.

And was James Poyntz a fool?

It was the last question she asked herself as she turned into the side
chapel where evensong was to be said. Some twenty kneeling figures were
there. The place was dimly lighted save for the tall gas standards by
the priests' seats in front of the altar.

High up before the painted reredos hung a single lamp that burned with a
dull red glow. There were many sick folk in the parish of St. Elwyn's:
at all hours of the day and night, the clergy were sent for to help a
departing soul upon its way hence, and the Blessed Sacrament was
reserved upon this altar in the side chapel.

       *       *       *       *       *

The simple and stately service was nearly over. The girl had listened to
the sonorous words as if she heard them now for the first time. As she
knelt, her heart seemed empty of the hopes, fears, and interests of
daily life. It seemed as a vessel into which something was steadily
flowing. And the fancy came to her that all she experienced was flowing
to her from the dim tabernacle upon the altar. It was almost a
_physical_ sense, it was full of awe and sweetness. She trembled
exceedingly as the service ended and her brother prayed for the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost.

For a time after the echoing footsteps of the clergy had died away, she
remained upon her knees. She was praying, but without words; all her
thoughts were caught up into one voiceless, wordless, passionate
ejaculation.

When at length she bowed low,--it was the first time she had ever done
such a thing,--before the altar, and left the church, it was by the west
door.

She had a fancy for the street, and she found that the thunder had all
passed away and that a painted summer's evening sky hung over the garish
town.

As she finally turned into the vicarage, she cast one look back at the
church. It rose among the houses high into the air. The sunset fired the
wet tiles of the roof and gilded the cross upon the lantern. She thought
of That which was within.




CHAPTER V

WEALTHY MISS PRITCHETT AND POOR GUSSIE DAVIES ENTER THE VICARAGE GARDEN


""Todgers,"" Mr. Stephens remarked to Lucy, as they went down into the
garden after lunch on Saturday, ""could do it when it chose.""

The last preparations for the garden party were being made. The big
marquee was erected, the tennis lawns were newly marked, there was a
small stand for the string band.

Waiters, looking oddly out of their element in the brilliant sunshine,
which showed dress-coats, serviceable enough at night, tinged with a
metallic green like a magpie's wing, were moving about with baskets of
strawberries and zinc boxes of ice.

The old-fashioned garden, an oasis in the wilderness of brick all
around, was brilliant with sunflowers, stocks, and geraniums; the lawns
were fresh and green. The curate was in tennis flannels and an Oxford
blazer, and Lucy meditated upon the influence of clothes, as her
betters had done before her. Stephens seemed to have put off his
priesthood with his tippet and cassock, and the jaunty cap covered a
head which seemed as if it had never worn a berretta. Lucy found, to her
own surprise, that she liked the man less so. It was a total inversion
of her ordinary ideas. She began to think that a priest should be robed
always.

Miss Cass, the housekeeper, in a new cap, came up to them. Lucy had
talked to the woman for more than an hour on Friday afternoon, and the
prejudice caused by her appearance was removed.

""I hope everything is satisfactory, Miss,"" she said. ""It all seems to be
going on well. The men from Whiteley's know their business.""

""It all seems splendid, Miss Cass,"" Lucy said. ""I'm sure it couldn't be
better. Have the band people come?""

""Yes, Miss, and the piano-entertainer too. They're having some
refreshment in the library. His Reverence is telling them funny stories,
Miss.""

She hurried away to superintend further arrangements.

""The vicar is always so fine,"" the young man said, with a delighted
enthusiasm in his chief that was always pleasant for Lucy to hear. ""He
gets on with men so well; such a lot of parsons don't. There's nothing
effeminate about the vicar. He's a man's man. I'll bet every one of
those fellows in there will go away feeling they've made a friend, and
that parsons aren't such scalawags after all.""

A burst of laughter came from the door leading into the garden, as if to
confirm his words, and Father Blantyre descended the steps with a little
knot of men dressed in something between livery and uniform, carrying
oddly shaped cases of black waterproof in their hands.

Laughing and joking, the men made their way towards the music stands.

The vicar came up to Lucy. ""How will it do?"" he said. ""It seems all
right. Just walk round with me, my dear, and I'll give ye a few tips how
to play hostess in Hornham.""

They strolled away together. ""Now, ye'll be careful, won't ye,
mavourneen?"" he said rather anxiously. ""The folk coming this afternoon
require more management and tact than any I've ever met. They'll all
have what they think is the high society manner--and ye mustn't laugh at
um, poor dears. I love 'em all, and I won't have you making fun of
them. I like them better in church than in society, I'm quite free to
admit to you, and their souls are more interesting than their bodies!
Perhaps half a dozen people here this afternoon will be what you'd call
gentlefolk--the doctor, Dr. Hibbert, and a few others. The rest of them
will be fearfully genteel. The young gentlemen will be back early from
the city, and they'll come in flannels and wear public-school ribbons
round their hats, roses in their button-holes and crimson silk
cummerbunds!""

""Good heavens!"" Lucy said.

""Yes, and they'll all want to flirt with ye, in a very superfine, polite
sort of way, and mind ye let um! They'll ask if they might 'assist you
to a little claret cup,' and say all sorts of strange things. But
they're good enough at heart, only they will be so polite!""

""And the women?""

Father Blantyre shrugged his shoulders. ""You'll find them rather
difficult,"" he said. ""You bet they see your name in the papers--they all
read the 'Fashionable Intelligence'--confound um!--and the attitude will
be a little hostile. But be civil for my sake, dear. I hate all this
just as much as you do. I can get in touch with them spiritually, but
socially I find it hard. But I think it's the right thing to do, to
entertain them all once or twice a year, and they do enjoy themselves!
And I owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude for their loyalty during
this trying week. I have had dozens and dozens of letters and calls.
Every one has rallied to the church in a wonderful and touching way
since the Sunday affair. God bless them all!""

Lucy squeezed his arm with sympathy. In an hour, the guests began to
arrive.

Lucy and her brother met them by the garden door of the house. It was a
gay scene enough. A brilliant flood of afternoon sunshine irradiated
everything; the women were well and fashionably dressed, the band
played, and every one seemed happy.

Lucy found it much easier than she expected. The guests were suburban,
of course, and not of the ""classic suburbs"" at that. But, she reflected,
there was hardly a man there who had not better manners than Lord
Rollington or General Pompe. And if they wore Carthusian or Zingari
ribbons, that meant no more than that they were blessed with a
colour-sense; while a slight admixture of ""i"" in the pronunciation of
the first vowel was certainly preferable to the admixture of looseness
and innuendo that she was sometimes forced to hear in much more exalted
circles. So she received tea and strawberries at the hands of gallant
and debonair young gentlemen engaged in the minor walks of commerce; she
chatted merrily with fluffy young ladies who, when they had gotten over
their first distrust of a girl who went to the drawing-room and stayed
with lords, finding that she wasn't the ""nasty, stuck-up thing"" they
expected, were somewhat effusively affectionate. She talked gravely
about the ""dear vicar and those dreadful men"" to ample matrons who for a
moment had forgotten the cares of a small suburban villa and a smaller
income, in the luxury of fashion, the latest waltz tunes, the champagne
cup, and a real social event. Indeed, everything went ""with a snap,"" as
one young gentleman remarked to Lucy. She became popular almost at once,
and was surrounded by assiduous young bloods of the city ""meccas.""

Father Blantyre, as he went about from group to group, was in a state of
extreme happiness, despite his somewhat gloomy anticipations. It was an
hour of triumph for him. His people, for whom he prayed and laboured and
gave his life and fortune, were one and all engaged to show him how
they would stand by him in the anticipated trouble. Everywhere he was
greeted with real warmth and affection, and before long the quick Celtic
temperament was bringing a mist before the merry grey eyes and a riot
and tumult of thankfulness within.

On all sides, he heard praises of his sister. ""The pretty dear,"" one
good lady, the wife of a cashier in a small Mincing Lane firm, said to
him. ""I had quite a long talk with her, Father Blantyre. And a sweet
girl she is. We're not in the way of meeting with society folk, though
we read of all the gay goings-on in the _Mail_; but I said to Pa, 'Pa,'
I said, 'if all the society girls are like that, then there's nothing
much the matter with the aristocracy, and _Modern Society_ is a
catchpenny rag.' And Pa quite agreed. He was as much struck by her as I
was.""

And so on. Every one seemed pleased with Lucy. The guests began to
arrive less and less frequently, until at length the gardens were
crowded and no one else appeared to be coming. All the various games and
entertainments were in full swing, and Lucy was about to accept the
invitation of a tall boy in a frock coat and a silk hat to sit down and
watch a set of tennis with him, when there was a slight stir and
commotion at the garden door of the house.

Miss Cass came hurriedly down the steps, as a sort of advance guard for
two ladies who were ushered into the garden by a waiter. The housekeeper
dived into the crowd and found the vicar, who turned and went with her
at once to meet the late-comers.

""There's Miss Pritchett and Gussie Davies,"" said the young man to Lucy
in rather an awed voice, and then, as if to banish some unwelcome
impression, relieved his feelings by the enigmatic remark of ""Pip, pip,""
which made Lucy stare at him, wondering what on earth he meant.

She noticed that nearly every one at this end of the garden was
watching, more or less openly, the meeting between the vicar and his
guests. She did not quite understand why, but guessed that some local
magnate had arrived, and looked with the rest.

The elder of the two women was expensively dressed in mauve silk, and
wore a small bonnet with a white aigrette over a coffee-coloured fringe
of hair that suggested art. Her face was plump and pompous, a
parrot-like nose curved over pursy lips that wore an expression of
arrogant ill-temper, and the small eyes glanced rapidly hither and
thither. In one white-gloved hand, the lady held a long-handled
lorgnette of tortoise-shell and gold. Every now and then she raised
these glasses and surveyed the scene before her, in exactly the manner
in which countesses and duchesses do upon the stage.

Her companion was young, a large, blonde girl, not ill-looking, but
without character or decision in her face or walk. She was dressed very
simply.

Lucy turned to her companion. ""Do you know them, then?"" she said.

""Rather,"" he replied. ""I should think I did. That's Miss Pritchett, old
Joseph Pritchett's daughter, old Joseph, the brewer. He left her all his
money, she's tons of stuff--awfully wealthy, I mean, Miss Blantyre.""

""Does she live here, then?""

""Oh, yes. In spite of all her money she's always been an unappropriated
blessing. She's part of Hornham, drives a pair in a landau. The girl is
Gussie Davies, her companion. She's not half a bad sort. All the Hornham
boys know Gussie. Nothing the matter with Gussie Davis! The old cat sits
on her fearfully, though. She can't call her soul her own. It's bally
awful, sometimes, Gussie says.""

Lucy gasped. These revelations were startling indeed. She was moving in
the queerest possible set of people. She hadn't realised that such folk
existed. It took her breath away, like the first plunge into a bath of
cold water.

The artless youth prattled on, and Lucy gathered that the lady with
the false front was a sort of female _arbiter elegantarium_
to Hornham, indubitably the richest person there, a leading light.
She saw her brother talking to the woman in an eager way. He seemed
afraid of her,--as, indeed, the poor man was, under the present
circumstances,--and Lucy resented it. With a quick feminine eye, she saw
that Miss Pritchett was assuming an air of tolerance, of patronage even,
to the vicar.

At last, Bernard caught sight of her. His face became relieved at once
and he led the spinster to the place where she was sitting.

Every instinct of the girl rose up in dislike and rebellion as the woman
drew near. She had felt nothing of the sort with the other people. In
this case, it was quite different. She prepared to repel cavalry, to use
the language of the military text-books.

On the surface, the incident was simple and commonplace enough. A
well-bred girl felt a repulsion for an obviously unpleasant and
patronising woman of inferior social rank. That was all. It is a trite
and well-worn aphorism that no event is trivial, yet it is
extraordinarily true. Who could have said that this casual meeting was
to be fraught with storm and danger for the Church in England; that out
of a hostile handshake between two women a mighty scandal and tumult was
to rise?

Miss Pritchett came up to Lucy, and Father Blantyre introduced her.
Then, with an apologetic murmur, he hurried away to another part of the
garden.

""Won't you sit down?"" Lucy said, looking at the chair that had been left
vacant by her late companion.

""Thank you, Miss Blantyre, but I've been sitting in my carriage. I
should prefer to stand, if it's the same to you,"" said Miss Pritchett.

Lucy rose. ""Perhaps you would like to walk round the grounds?"" she
asked.

""Probably I know the grounds better than you,"" the elder woman answered
with a patronage which was bordering on the purely ludicrous. ""This
residence was one of my dear father's houses, as were many of the
Hornham houses. When the vicar acquired the property, the brewery
trustees sold it to him, though I think it far from suitable for a
parish clergyman.""

""Well, yes,"" Lucy answered. ""It certainly is a dingy, gloomy old place,
but what else can you expect down here?""

Miss Pritchett flushed and tossed her head till the aigrette in her
smart little bonnet shook like a leaf.

""One is liable to be misunderstood,"" she said. ""Your brother's small
private means enable him to live in a house which the next vicar or any
ordinary clergyman could hardly hope for.""

""It _is_ very good of Bernard to come down here and spend his life in
such an impossible place,"" Lucy said. She was thoroughly angry now and
quite determined to give the woman a lesson. Her impertinence was
insufferable. To hear this creature speak of Bernard's income of three
thousand a year--every penny of which he gave away or spent for good--in
this way was unendurable.

Miss Pritchett grew redder than ever. She was utterly incapable of
bearing rebuff or contradiction. Her local eminence was unquestioned.
She had never moved from Hornham, where her wealth and large interests
secured for her that slavish subserviency that a vain and petty spirit
loves. For months past, she had been gradually gathering up cause for
quarrel and bitterness with the clergy of St. Elwyn's. She had found
that once within the portals of the church she was just as anyone else.
She could not lord it over the priests as she wished to do. For once,
she was beginning to find that her money was powerless, there was no
""high seat in the synagogue"" that it could buy.

""The place has been good enough for _me_,"" she said angrily, never
doubting that this was final.

""Ah, yes,"" Lucy answered. ""That, Miss Pritchett, I can quite
understand."" The Hornham celebrity was a stupid woman. Her brain was as
empty as a hen's, and she was not adroit enough to seize upon the real
meaning of this remark. She had an uneasy suspicion that it was
offensive, and that was all.

""What you may mean by 'impossible' I am not aware,"" she continued. ""I
speak plain English myself. But those that don't know of a place didn't
ought to speak unfavourable of it. As for your brother, I've always said
that he was a worthy person and acted as well as he might, until late
months, when I've felt it my duty to say a word or two in season as to
some of the church matters.""

""I hope he profited, Miss Pritchett.""

""I fear that he did not receive my words as he should, coming from a
lady of standing in the place--and him only here three years. I'm
beginning to think that there's something in the popular agitation. Upon
my word! Priests do take a good deal on themselves nowadays. It wouldn't
have been allowed when I was a girl.""

""Things have altered very much for the better during the last fifty
years,"" Lucy said pointedly.

This the lady did immediately apprehend. She lifted the lorgnette and
stared at her companion in speechless anger. The movement was meant to
be crushing. It was thus, Miss Pritchett knew from her reading, that
women of the aristocracy crushed inferiors.

It was too much for Lucy. She endeavoured to control her feelings, but
they were irresistible. She had not seen anything so funny as this
vulgar and pompous old thing for years. A smile broadened out upon her
face, and then, without further ado, she burst out into peal after peal
of laughter.

The flush on Miss Pritchett's face died away. It grew perfectly white
with passion.

She turned round. Her companion had been walking some three yards behind
them in a listless and dejected fashion, looking with greedy eyes at the
allurements on every side, and answering the furtive greetings of
various male friends with a pantomime, expressive of contempt,
irritation, and hopeless bondage in equal parts.

Miss Pritchett stepped up to her, and caught hold of her arm. Her
fingers went so deep into the flesh that the girl gasped and gave a
half-smothered cry.

""Take me to the carriage,"" Miss Pritchett said. ""Let me leave this place
of Popery and light women!""

The obedient Gussie Davies turned and, in a moment or two, both women
had disappeared.

Lucy sought her brother. She found him eating a large pink ice in
company with a florid, good-humoured matron in maroon, with an avalanche
of lace falling from the edges of her parasol. ""Hallo, dear!"" he said.
""Let me introduce you to Mrs. Stiffe, Dr. Hibbert's sister. And where's
Miss Pritchett?""

""She's gone,"" Lucy answered. ""And, I'm very much afraid, in a towering
rage. But really she was so insolent that I could _not_ stand it. I
would do most things for you, Ber, but, really, that woman!""

""Well, it can't be helped, I suppose,"" the vicar said with humorous
resignation. ""It was bound to come sooner or later, and I'm selfish
enough to be glad it's you've given me lady the _congé_ and not me. Mrs.
Stiffe here knows her, don't you, Mrs. Stiffe?""

""I do, Mr. Blantyre,"" the stout lady said. ""I've met the woman several
times when I've been staying down here with my brother. A fearful old
cat _I_ call her! I wonder that you put up with her so long!""

""Policy, Mrs. Stiffe--ye know we're all Jesuits here, the local paper
says so in yesterday's issue--policy! You see, when I first came here
Miss Pritchett came to church. She's a leading person here and I made no
doubt others would follow her. Indeed, they did, too! and when they saw
what the Catholic Church really was they stayed with us. And then,
again, Miss Pritchett was always ready to give us a cheque for any good
work, and we want all the money we can get! Oh, there's a lot of good in
Miss Pritchett!""

""I fail to see it on a short acquaintance,"" Lucy remarked; ""if she gave
generously, it was only to flatter her vanity. I'm sure of that.""

""It's a great mistake to attribute unworthy motives to worthy deeds,""
the vicar said. ""We've no right to do it, and it's only giving ourselves
away when we do, after all!""

""Oh, it's all very well, Vicar,"" said good Mrs. Stiffe; ""we know you
never say anything against any one. But if Miss Pritchett is such an
angel, what's the reason of her behaviour now? My brother told me that
things were getting very strained.""

""Ah, that's a different matter entirely,"" Blantyre said. ""She began to
interfere in important things. And, of course, we couldn't have that.
I'd have let her manage the soup-kitchens and boss the ladies' guilds
till the sky fell. But she wanted to do more than that. Poor dear King
offended her in some way--he's not what ye'd call a ladies' man--and she
wrote to me to send him away at once! And there were other incidents.
I've been doing my best to meet her views and to keep in with her, but
it's been very difficult and I felt the storm would burst soon. I wanted
to keep her in the Faith for her own silly sake! She's not a very
strong-minded person beneath her manner, and she's just the sort of
woman some spiritualistic quack or Christian Science gentleman would get
hold of and ruin her health and happiness. I did hope she'd find peace
in the Church. Well, it can't be helped,"" he ended with a rather sad
smile, for his heart was tender for all his flock and he saw far down
into the human soul and loved it. Then he changed suddenly. ""What am I
doing!"" he cried, ""talking parochial politics at a garden party! Shame
on me! Come on, Mrs. Stiffe, come on, Lucy, Mr. Chaff, the
piano-entertainer, is going to give his happy half-hour at Earl's
Court.""

They went merrily away with him. As they approached the rows of chairs
in front of the piano, he turned suddenly to his sister.

""Why didn't ye knock her down?"" he said suddenly, with an exaggerated
brogue and real comic force. Both ladies burst out laughing.

""You ought to have been on the music-hall stage, Vicar,"" Mrs. Stiffe
said, ""you're wasted in Hornham.""

""So I've been told,"" he said. ""I shall think seriously of it. It's a
pity to waste a talent.""




CHAPTER VI

BOADICEA, JOAN OF ARC, CHARLOTTE CORDAY, JAEL, AND MISS PRITCHETT OF
HORNHAM


People of taste are never without wonder at the extraordinary lack of it
that many well-to-do folk display. It was but rarely that a person of
taste entered Malakoff Lodge, where Miss Pritchett dwelt, but when such
an event did happen, the impression was simply that of enormous
surprise. The drawing-room into which visitors were shown was an immense
place and full of furniture. In each of the corners stood a life-sized
piece of statuary painted in ""natural colours."" Here one saw an immense
negro, some six feet high, with coffee-coloured skin, gleaming red lips,
and a gaudy robe of blue and yellow. This monster supported a large
earthenware basket on his back, painted, of course, in correct
straw-colour, from which sprang a tall palm that reached to the ceiling.
In other corners of the room were an Egyptian dancing-girl, a Turk, and
an Indian fakir, all of which supported ferns, which it was part of
Miss Gussie Davies' duty to water every morning.

The many tables, chiefly of circular or octagonal form, which stood
about the room, bore a multitude of costly and hideous articles which
should have been relegated to a museum, to illustrate the deplorable
taste of the middle classes during the early and mid-Victorian era.
Here, for example, was a model of the leaning tower of Pisa done in
white alabaster, some two feet in height, and shielded from harm by a
thick glass case. There, the eye fell upon a bunch of very purple grapes
and a nectarine or two, made of wax, with a waxen bee settling upon
them, all covered with glass also. Literary tastes were not forgotten.
Immense volumes of Moore's poems, the works of Southey or Robert
Montgomery lay about on the tables. These were bound in heavy leather
boards, elaborately tooled in gold representations of Greek lyres and
golden laurel crowns. The shining gilt edges were preserved from the
profanation of a casual opening by two or three immense brass clasps
which imprisoned the poet's thoughts within.

The time in which these things were made was a sentimental age, and it
was well reflected in its _bijouterie_. Innumerable nymphs and
shepherdesses stood about offering each other hearts, madrigals, and
other dainties. But they had none of the piquant grace that Watteau
would have given them, or the charm the white-hot fires of Dresden might
have burnt into them. They were solid, very British nymphs, whose
drapery was most decorously arranged that one thick ankle might be
visible, but no more;--nymphs and shepherdesses who, one might imagine,
sat happily by the bank of some canal, singing the pious ditties of Dr.
Watts as the sun went down,--nymphs, in short, with a moral purpose. The
hangings of Miss Pritchett's room, the heavy window curtains that
descended from baldachinos of gleaming gold, were all of a rich crimson,
an extraordinary colour that is not made now, and the wall-paper was a
heavy pattern in dark ultramarine and gold. Indeed, there was enough
gold in this mausoleum to have satisfied Miss Killmansegg herself.

One merit the place had in summer, it was cool, and when the barouche
that was the envy of Hornham drove up at Malakoff gates, Miss Pritchett
rushed into the drawing-room, and, sinking into an arm-chair of purple
plush, fanned a red and angry face with her handkerchief.

The companion followed her meekly.

""Wait there, Miss Davies,"" said the spinster sharply; ""stand there for a
moment, please, till I can get my breath.""

Miss Davies remained standing before her patroness in meek obedience.
After a minute or two, Miss Pritchett motioned with her hand towards an
adjacent chair. Gussie Davies sat down.

It was part of the spinster's life to subject her companion to a kind of
drill in this way. The unfortunate girl's movements were regulated
mathematically, and in her more genial and expansive moments Miss
Pritchett would explain that her ""nerves"" required that this should be
so--that she should have absolute control over the movements of any one
who was in the room with her.

There had been spirited contests between Miss Pritchett and a long
succession of girls who had refused to play the part of automaton, but
in Gussie Davies, the lady had found a willing slave. She paid her well,
and in return was served with diligence and thorough obsequiousness.
Gussie was adroit, more adroit than her somewhat lymphatic appearance
would have led the casual observer to suppose. Properly trained, she
might almost have made a psychologist, but her opportunities had been
limited. However, for several years, she had directed a sharp brain to
the study of one person, and she knew Miss Pritchett as Mr. Sponge knew
his Mogg. Her influence with that lady was enormous, the more so in that
it was not at all suspected by the object, who imagined that the girl
was hers, body and soul. But, nevertheless, Miss Davies, who hailed from
Wales and had a large share of the true Cymric cunning, could play upon
her mistress with sure fingers, and, while submitting to every form of
petty tyranny, and occasionally open insult, she ruled the foolish woman
she was with.

Gussie sat down. Miss Pritchett did not speak at once, and the girl
judged, correctly enough, that she was meant to open the ball.

""O Miss Pritchett!"" she said with a little shudder, ""what a relief it
must be to you to be back in your own mansion!""

Nothing pleased the spinster more than the word mansion as applied to
her house. Gussie used the term with discretion, employing it only on
special occasions, unwilling to be prodigal of so sure a card.

""You may well say that, child,"" Miss Pritchett answered faintly.

""Now you must let me ring for a glass of port for you,"" the young lady
continued. ""You need it, indeed you do. I'll take the responsibility on
myself.""

She rose and rang the bell. ""Two glasses,"" said Miss Pritchett when the
answering maid had received her order. ""You shall have a glass, Gussie,
for I feel I am to blame in taking you to such a place. I have seen the
world, and I have met women of that class before, I am sorry to say. But
hitherto I have managed to shield you from such contamination.""

Gussie sighed the sigh of innocence, a sigh which the young men with
whom she larked about in Alexandra Gardens never heard.

""I wish I had your knowledge of the world,"" she said. ""But, of course,
I've never mixed in society, not like you.""

The port arrived and in a minute or two the experienced damsel saw that
her patroness was settling down for a long and confidential chat. The
moment promised a golden opportunity, of which she meant to take
advantage if she possibly could. She had a big scheme in hand; she was
primed with it by minds more subtle than her own. The image of Sam
Hamlyn was before her and she burned to deserve that gentleman's
commendation.

""Yes,"" said Miss Pritchett, ""as a girl, when I used to go to the Lord
Mayor's balls at the Mansion House with papa and mamma, I saw what
society really was. And it's worse now! That abandoned hussy at the
vicarage is an example of what I mean. I must not go into details before
you, child, but I know what I know!""

""How _awful_, Miss Pritchett! I saw her making eyes at all the gentlemen
before you went up to her.""

""All's fish that comes to the net of such,"" replied Miss Pritchett. ""An
earl's toy, the giddy bubble floating on the open sewer of a London
season, or the sly allurer of an honest young city gentleman. Anything
in trousers, child, is like herrings to a cat!""

""How _awful_! Miss Pritchett,"" repeated Gussie, wondering what it would
be like to be an earl's toy, and rather thinking she would enjoy it. ""I
suppose you'll go to the vicarage just as usual, though,--on parish
business, I mean.""

This, as the girl expected, provoked a storm, which she patiently
endured, certain that she was in a way to gain her ends. At length, the
flow of voluble and angry words grew less. Miss Pritchett was enjoying
herself too much to risk the girl's non-compliance with her mood.

""There, there,"" she said eventually, ""it's only your ignorance I know,
Gussie, but you do aggravate me. You don't understand society. Never
shall I set foot in that man's house again!""

Gussie gasped. Her face expressed fervent admiration at such a daring
resolve, but slight incredulity as well.

The bait took again. ""Never, as I'm a living lady!"" said Miss Pritchett,
""and I don't know as I shall ever drive up to the church doors in my
carriage on a Sunday morning more! Opinions may change. I _may_ have
been--I don't say I _have_ been, yet, mind you--I _may_ have been led
away by the false glitter of Roman doctrine and goings on.""

The idea seemed to please the lady. She saw herself picturesque in such
a situation.

Gussie started suddenly.

""What's the matter, child?"" she was asked tartly; ""do you think no
one's got any nerves? Keep still, do!""

""I'm very sorry, Miss Pritchett, but when you said that, I remembered
something I was reading last night in the _Hornham Observer_.""

""I was keeping it for Sunday afternoon,"" said Miss Pritchett. ""I did
mean to go to morning service and then read Mr. Hamlyn's side of last
Sunday's proceedings at home, comfortable like. But what's in the
paper?""

""A great deal that will interest you, dear Miss Pritchett, though I do
not know if you will be pleased.""

""Pleased? What do you mean?""

""Your name is mentioned several times.""

""Is it, indeed! We'll soon see about that! Fetch the paper at once and
read what it says. If Mr. Hamlyn's been foolish enough to talk about his
betters, I'll very soon have him turned neck and crop out of the place.
He's a man I've never spoken to more than twice, and he must be taught
his place in Hornham.""

Gussie went out to fetch the paper. She smiled triumphantly as she came
into the hall. All was going well and, moreover, her quick ear had
caught the slight trace of wavering and alarm in the concluding words
of her mistress. Miss Pritchett, like many other people, was never able
to rid herself of a superstitious reverence for print. She devoutly
believed the cheap romances that formed her literary food, and even a
small local newspaper was not without a strong influence on one whose
whole sympathies and interests were local.

Gussie came back with the paper. ""There's two whole pages about the St.
Elwyn's business,"" she said, ""column after column, with great big
letters at the top. Shall I begin at the beginning?""

""No, no; read the bits about me, of course. Read what it was that made
you jump like a cat in an oven just now.""

""That particular bit did not mention your name, Miss Pritchett, but it
chimed in so with what you said just now. I wonder if I can find
it?--ah, here it is--

""'And so I think I have accounted for the reason of the popularity of
such services as go on at St. Elwyn's among the poorer classes. A
wealthy clergyman can buy attendance at any idolatry, and who would
blame a starving brother, desperate for food, perhaps, for attendance at
a mummery which is nothing to him but the price of a much-needed meal?
Not I. Tolerance has ever been the watch-word of the _Observer_, and,
however much I may regret that even the poorest man may be forced to
witness the blasphemous and hideous mockery of Truth that takes place at
St. Elwyn's, I blame not the man, but the cunning of a priesthood that
buys his attendance and then points to him as a convert to thinly veiled
Romanism.'""

Gussie stopped for a moment to take breath. Miss Pritchett's face was
composed to pleasure. This was hot and strong indeed! She wondered how
Father Blantyre liked this!

Worthy Mr. Hamlyn, indeed, had heard of the little incident of the navvy
and Father King, and knew that the erstwhile antagonist was now housed
in the vicarage. Hence the preceding paragraph. Gussie went on:

""'But what shall we say when we find rank and fashion, acute
intelligence and honoured names bowing down in the House of Rimmon? How
shall we in Hornham regard such a strange and--so it seems to
us--unnatural state of affairs?

""'The Scarlet Woman is powerful indeed! It would be idle to attempt to
deny it. The drowsy magic of Rome has permeated with its subtle
influence homes where we should have hoped it would never enter. And why
is this? I think we can understand the reason in some measure. Let us
take an imaginary case. Let us suppose that there is among us a woman of
high station, of intellect, wealth, and charm. She sees a struggling
priesthood establish itself in a Protestant neighbourhood. The sympathy
that woman will ever have for the weak is enlisted; she visits a church,
not realising what its sham and ceremony leads to, under what Malign
Influence it is carried on. And then a gracious nature is attracted by
the cunning amenities of worship. The music, the lights, the flowers,
the gorgeous robes, appeal to a high and delicate nature. For a time, it
passes under the sway of an arrogant priesthood, and, with that sweet
submission which is one of the most alluring of feminine charms, bows
before a Baal which it does not realise, a golden calf that it would
abhor and repudiate were it not blinded by its own charity and
unsuspicious trust! Have I drawn a picture that is too strong? I think
not. It is only by analogy that we can best present the Truth.

""'Nevertheless we do not hesitate to assert, and assert with absolute
conviction, that, if such a clouding of a fine nature were temporarily
possible, it would be but transient. Truth will prevail. In the end, we
shall see all those who are now the puppets and subjects of a Romanising
attempt come back to the clear sunlight of Protestantism, away from the
stink-pots and candles, the toys of ritual, the poison of a painted
lie.'""

Gussie read the paragraphs with unction. She read them rather well. As
she made an end, her guilty conscience gave her a fear that the unusual
emphasis might have awakened some suspicion in Miss Pritchett's mind.
But with great relief she saw that it was not so. That lady was
manifestly excited. Her eyes were bright and there was a high flush on
the cheek-bones. Truth to tell, Miss Pritchett had always suspected that
there were depths of hidden gold in her nature. But they had never been
so vividly revealed to her before.

""Give me the paper,"" she said in a tremulous voice; ""let me read it for
myself!""

Her unguarded words showed Miss Davies how completely the fortress was
undermined. The spinster read the words through her glasses and then
handed the paper back to her companion.

""The man that wrote that,"" she said, ""is a good and sincere man. He
knows how the kind heart can be imposed upon and deceived! I shall take
an early opportunity of meeting Mr. Hamlyn. He will be a great man some
day, if I am any judge.""

""He must have had his eye on the Malakoff,"" Gussie said. ""Why, dear Miss
Pritchett, he has described you to a T. There is no one else in Hornham
to whom it could apply.""

""Hush, child! It may be as you say. This worthy man may have been
casting his eye over the parish and thought that he saw in me something
of which he writes. It is not for me to deny it. I can only say that in
his zeal he has much exaggerated the humble merits of one who, whatever
her faults, has merely tried to do her duty in the station to which she
has been called. And if Providence has placed that station high, it is
Providence's will, and we must not complain!""

""How beautifully you put it, Miss Pritchett!""

The chatelaine of Malakoff wiped a tear from her eye. The excitement of
the afternoon, the glass of port, the periods of Mr. Hamlyn's prose,
had all acted upon nerves pampered by indulgence and tightened with
self-irritation.

""I believe you care for me, child,"" said Miss Pritchett with a sob.

""How it rejoices me to hear you say so, Miss Pritchett,"" Gussie replied,
seeing that her opportunity had now come. ""But your generous nature
gives way too easily. You are unstrung by the wanton insults of that
woman! Let me read you the concluding portion of Mr. Hamlyn's article.
It may soothe you.""

""Read it,"" murmured the spinster, now lost in an ecstasy of luxurious
grief, though she would have been puzzled to give a reason for it.

Gussie took up the paper once more. Now that her battle was so nearly
won, she allowed herself more freedom in the reading. The Celtic love of
drama stirred within her and she gave the pompous balderdash _ore
rotundo_.

""'And in conclusion, what is our crying need in England to-day? It is
this: It is the establishment of a great crusade for the crushing of the
disguised Popery in our midst. One protest has been made in Hornham,
protests should be made all over England. A mighty organisation should
be called into existence which should make every ""priest"" tremble in his
cope and cassock, tremble for the avalanche of public reprobation which
will descend upon him and his.

""'I may be a visionary and no such idea as I have in my mind may be
possible. But I think not. Who can say that our borough of Hornham may
not become famous in history as the spot in which the second Reformation
was born!

""'Much needs to be done before such a glorious movement can be
inaugurated; that it will be inaugurated a band of earnest and
determined men and women live in the liveliest hope.

""'I am confident that a movement having its seed in the borough, if
widely published and made known to patriotic English people, would be
supported with swift and overwhelming generosity by the country at
large. The public response would appal the Ritualists and even astonish
loyal sons of the Church of England. But, in order to start this
crusade, help is required. Some noble soul must come forward to start
the machine, to raise the Protestant Flag.

""'Where shall we find him or her? Is there no one in our midst willing
to become the patron of Truth and to earn the praise of thousands and a
place in history?

""'Once Joan of Arc led the forces of her country to victory. A Charlotte
Corday slew the monster Marat, a Boadicea hurled herself against the
legions of Rome! Who will be our Boadicea to-day, who will come forward
to crush the tyranny of Rome in our own England? For such a noble lady,
who will revive in her own person the undying deeds of antiquity, I can
promise a fame worth more than all the laurels of the old British queen,
the heartfelt thanks and love of her countrymen, and above all of her
country-women--over whose more kindly and unsuspicious natures the
deadly Upas-tree of Romanism has cast its poisonous shade. Where is the
Jael who will destroy this Sisera?'""

Miss Davies ceased. Her voice sank. No sound was heard but the snuffle
that came from the plush arm-chair opposite, where Miss Pritchett was
audibly weeping. Mr. Hamlyn's purple prose had been skilfully introduced
at the psychological moment. The woman's ill-balanced temperament was
awry and smarting. Her egregious vanity was wounded as it had rarely
been wounded before. She had been treated as of no account, and she was
burning with spite and the longing for revenge.

Gussie said nothing more. She let the words of the newspaper do their
work without assistance.

Presently Miss Pritchett looked up. She wiped her eyes and a grim
expression of determination came out upon her face.

""I see it all!"" she said suddenly. ""My trusting nature has been terribly
deceived; I have been led into error by evil counsellors; the power of
the Jesuits has been secretly brought to bear upon one who, whatever her
failings, has scorned suspicion!""

""Oh, Miss Pritchett, how _awful_!"" said Gussie.

""Yes,"" continued the lady with a delighted shudder, ""the net has been
thrown over me and I was nigh to perish. But Providence intervenes! I
see how I am to be the 'umble instrument of crushing error in the
Church. I shall step into the breach!""

""Oh, Miss Pritchett, how _noble_!""

""Miss Davies, you will kindly put on your jacket and walk round to Mr.
Hamlyn's house. See Mr. Hamlyn and tell him that Miss Pritchett is too
agitated by recent events to write personally, but she begs he will
favour her with his company at supper to discuss matters of great public
importance. Tell Jones to send up some sweetbreads at once, and inform
cook as a gentleman will be here to supper, and to serve the cold
salmon.""

Gussie rose quickly. ""Oh, Miss Pritchett,"" she cried, ""what a great day
for England this will be!""




CHAPTER VII

THE OFFICES OF THE ""LUTHER LEAGUE""--AN INTERIOR


On the first floor of a building in the Strand, wedged in between a
little theatre and a famous restaurant, the offices of the ""Luther
League"" were established, and by late autumn were in the full swing of
their activity.

Visitors to this stronghold of Protestantism mounted a short flight of
stairs and arrived in a wide passage. Four or five doors opening into it
all bore the name of the association in large letters of white enamel.
The first door bore the legend:

     ""PUBLISHING AND GENERAL OFFICE INQUIRIES""

This room, the one by which the general public were admitted to the
inner sanctuaries, was a large place fitted up with desks and glass
compartments in much the same way as the ordinary clerks' office of a
business house. A long counter divided the room, and upon it were
stacked piles of the newly published pamphlet literature of the League.
Here could be seen that stirring narrative, _Cowed by the Confessional;
or, The Story of an English Girl in the Power of the ""Priests.""_ This
publication, probably the cheapest piece of pornography in print at the
moment, was published, with an illustration, at three pence. Upon the
cover a priest--for some unexplained reason in full eucharistic
vestments--was pointing sternly to the armour-plated door of a grim
confessional, while a trembling lady in a large picture hat shrunk
within.

This little book was flanked by what appeared to be a semi-jocular work
called _Who Said Reredos?_ and bore upon its cover the already
distinguished name of Samuel Hamlyn, Jr. The eye fell upon that popular
pamphlet in a wrapper of vivid scarlet--now in its sixtieth
thousand--known as _Bow to the ""Altar"" and Light Bloody Mary's Torture
Fires Again_.

_As Soon Pay the Devil as the Priest_ lay by the side of a more
elaborately bound volume on which was the portrait of a lady. Beneath
the picture appeared the words of the title, _My Escape; or, How I
Became a Protestant_, by Jane Pritchett.

Two clerks wrote in the ledgers on the desks, attended to visitors, and
looked after what was known in the office as the ""counter trade""--to
distinguish it from the sale of Protestant literature in bulk, which was
managed direct from the ""Luther League Printing Works, Hornham, N.""

A second room opening into the general office was tenanted by the
assistant secretary of the League, Mr. Samuel Hamlyn, Junior. Here the
walls were decorated with scourges, horribly knotted and thonged;
""Disciplines,"" which were belts and armlets of sharp iron prickles,
designed to wear the skin of the toughest Ritualist into an open sore
after three days' wear. There were also two hair shirts, apparently the
worse for wear, and a locked bookcase of Ritualistic literature with a
little _index expurgatorius_ in the neat, clerkly writing of Sam Hamlyn,
and compiled by that gentleman himself.

In this chamber of horrors, the assistant secretary delighted to move
and have his being, and three or four times a day it was his pleasing
duty to show friends of the League and its yearly subscribers, the
penitential machinery by which the priest-ridden public was secretly
invited to hoist itself to heaven.

The innermost room of all was where Mr. Hamlyn, Senior, himself
transacted the multifarious and growing business of his organisation.
The secretary sat at a large roll-top desk, and a substantial safe stood
at his right hand. An air of brisk business pervaded this sanctum. The
directories, almanacs, and account-books all contributed to it, and the
end of a speaking-tube, which led to the outer office, was clipped to
the arm of the revolving chair.

Three portraits adorned the wall. From a massive gold frame the features
of that fiery Protestant virgin, Miss Pritchett, stared blandly down
into the room. Opposite it was a large photograph of Mr. Hamlyn himself,
with upraised hand and parted lips--in the very act and attitude of
making one of his now familiar protests. The third in this trio of
Protestant champions was a drawing of Martin Luther himself,
""representing the Reformer,"" as Mr. Hamlyn was wont to say, ""singing for
joy at the waning power of Rome."" The artist of this picture, however,
being a young gentleman of convivial tastes, had portrayed the
""Nightingale of Wittemberg"" in a merry mood, remembering, perhaps,
Carlyle's remark, ""there is laughter in this Luther,"" or perhaps--as is
indeed most probable--remembering little of the great man but his
authorship of the ditty that concludes:

    Who loves not women, wine, and song
    Will be a fool his whole life long.

Fortunately, Mr. Hamlyn, whose historical studies had been extremely
restricted, did not know of this effort--just as he did not know that to
the end of his life the student of Erfurt steadily proclaimed his belief
in the Real Presence in the Eucharist.

About ten o'clock on a grey, cold November morning, the two Hamlyns
arrived at the offices of the Luther League together, walked briskly up
the stairs, and, with a curt ""good morning"" to the clerks, entered the
innermost room together.

People who had known the father and son six months ago, seeing them now,
would have found a marked, though subtle, difference in both of them.

They were much better dressed, for one thing. The frock-coats were not
made in Hornham, the silk hats were glossy and with the curly brims of
the fashion. Both still suggested a more than nodding acquaintance with
religious affairs in their costume, some forms of Christianity always
preferring to evince themselves by the style of a cravat or the texture
of a cloth.

Confidence had never been lacking in either of the two, but now the
sense of power and success had increased it, and had also imposed a
certain quietness and gravity which impressed people. Here, at any rate,
were two men of affairs, men whose names were beginning to be known
throughout the land, and Mr. Hamlyn's manner of preoccupation and
thought was only natural after all in one who (as his son would remark
to Protestant visitors) ""practically held the fortunes of the Church in
his hands, and was destroying the Catholic wolves with the sword of
Protestant Truth.""

The two men took off their overcoats and hung them up. Then Mr. Hamlyn,
from mere force of old habit, pulled at his cuffs--in order to lay them
aside during business hours. Finding that he could not withdraw them,
for increasing position and emolument had seemed to necessitate the
wearing of a white shirt, he sat down with a half sigh for the freedom
and comfort of an earlier day and began to open the large pile of
correspondence on the table before him.

""We'll take the cash first, Sam,"" he said, pulling a small paper-knife
from a drawer.

Sam opened a note-book in which the first rough draughts of matter
relating to this most important subject were entered, preparatory to
being copied out into one of the ledgers in the outer office.

Hamlyn began to slit up the letters with a practised hand. Those that
contained the sinews of war he read with a running comment, others were
placed in a basket for further consideration.

""'Well-wisher,' five shillings; 'Well-wisher,' £2 0 0, by cheque, Sam.
'Ethel and her sisters,' ten and six--small family that, I should think!
'Protestant,' five pounds--a note, Sam, take the number. It's curious
that 'Protestant' always gives most. Yesterday seven 'Protestants'
totalled up to fourteen, twelve, six, while five 'Well-wishers' worked
out at slightly under three shillings a head. What's this? Ah! cheque
for a guinea and a letter on crested paper! Enter up the address and
make a note to send half a dozen _Bloody Marys_, one Miss Pritchett's
_Escape_, and a few _Pay the Devils_. During the last week or two, the
upper classes have been rallying to the flag. They're the people. I'll
send this woman the ten-guinea subscription form and ask her to be one
of the vice-presidents. Listen here:


     MARGRAVINE HOUSE,
     LEICESTER

     Lady Johnson begs to enclose a cheque for one guinea to aid Mr.
     Hamlyn in his splendid Crusade against the Ritualists. She would be
     glad to hear full details of the ""Luther League"" and its objects.
     She wonders why Mr. Hamlyn has confined his protests against
     _Romanism_ in the guise of _English Churchmanship_ to the London
     district, and would point out that in her own neighbourhood there
     is a hot-bed of Ritualism which should be exposed.""

Sam went to the book shelf and took down a Peerage. ""She's the wife of a
knight,"" he said, ""one of the city knights.""

""Probably very well off,"" said Mr. Hamlyn. ""We'll nail her for the
Cause! See that the books go off at once, and I'll write her a personal
letter during the day.""

He rubbed his hands together with a movement of inexpressible
satisfaction. His keen face was lighted up with the pleasures of power
and success.

""She's got her own axe to grind,"" remarked Sam. ""Had a flare-up with the
local parson, I expect.""

""Shouldn't wonder,"" replied his father indifferently. ""Here's two
p.o.'s, one for seven bob and one for three. From a Wesleyan minister at
Camborne in Cornwall. I'll put him down to be written to under the local
helpers' scheme. His prayers'll be with us, he says!"" Mr. Sam sniffed
impatiently as he wrote down the sum in his book.

In a few more minutes, the contributions were all booked up and the
Church of England--as represented by these two eminent laymen--was
bulwarked against the enemies to the extent of some seventeen pounds.

""Now,"" said Mr. Hamlyn, ""let's take the press-cuttings next."" He opened
a large envelope.

A day or two before Mr. Hamlyn had varied his pleasant little habit of
turning up during the most solemn moments of a church service and
brawling until he was ejected with more or less force, being brought up
at a police-court a day or two afterwards and paying the fine imposed
upon him with a cheque from Miss Pritchett. During the blessing of a new
peal of bells in a provincial cathedral, he had risen and read a paper
of protest. He had read the paper in a low, hurried voice, and the
disturbance had been purely local and attracted but little attention in
the huge building. In a moment, almost, the secretary of the Luther
League had been conducted to the door of the building by vigilant
vergers.

But the commotion in the press next morning had been enormous. Lurid
reports of this great protest appeared in leaded type, comment of every
kind filled the papers, and their editors were inundated with letters on
the subject. As an editor himself, Mr. Hamlyn well understood the
interior machinery of a newspaper office, and was perfectly well
acquainted with the various methods by which things get into print. He
began to examine the cuttings from the weekly papers that Durrant's had
sent him.

""All goes on well,"" he said at length. ""It really is astonishing the
space they give us! Who'd have thought it six months ago! Don't they go
for the League in some of them! Just listen to this, it's the finish of
a column in _Vigilance_:

""'... and I shall therefore await the publication of the promised
balance-sheet of this precious ""League"" with more than usual interest.
Such an indecent and futile campaign as this deserves to be thoroughly
scrutinised.'""

""That's nasty, Pa,"" said Sam.

""It don't matter in the least. Our League is perfectly honest and
above-board, thank goodness! We shall publish the balance-sheet, of
course. We are doing a great and glorious work for Hengland, and the
labourer is worthy of his hire. We are perfectly justified in taking our
salaries. What does a parson do? And, besides no one reads _Vigilance_
that's likely to give Protestant campaigns a penny. It's a society
paper. Religious people don't see it.""

""Quite so. And all the Protestant papers are with us; that's the great
thing.""

""Exactly, even the old established evangelical papers like the _Church
Recorder_ daren't say anything against us. You see our advertisements
are worth such a lot to 'em! Half the Low Church papers can't pay their
way, the big advertisers won't look at them. All the money goes to the
_Church Standard_ and the other Ritualistic rags. The _Standard's_ one
of the best paying properties in London. So the Low Church papers
_can't_ do without us. Wait a year, Sam, and we'll have our own paper,
put in some Fleet Street hack as editor, publish at a separate office,
and charge the account what we like for our own articles.""

""Our position is practically unassailable, as far as I can see.""

""It's just that, my boy--as long as people send in the money. But
gradually we shall find London getting dry. It's all right now that the
boom's on, but the novelty of the thing will wear off after a bit. And
what we want is to get ourselves so strong that the League will go on
_for ever_! Now, I look on it in this way: Much as I 'ate the Ritualists
and love true Henglish Protestantism""--Mr. Hamlyn's face grew full of
fervour as he said this--""much as I 'ate Romanising tricks and such, I'm
jolly well certain that neither we nor any one else is going to make
much difference to them! They're too strong, Sam. You'll find a red-hot
Ritualist would give up his arms and legs for his carryings-on.
Ritualism's getting stronger and stronger. _They've got the best men for
parsons_, and you see those chaps aren't in it for their own game, as a
rule. They live like paupers and give all they've got away. Well, that
gives 'em grip.""

""Silly fools,"" said Sam contemptuously.

""Poor deluded tools of Rome,"" said Mr. Hamlyn, who, now that his great
mission was an accomplished fact, was really beginning to believe in it
himself. ""Well, my point is this: Ritualism will never stop. It's too
well organised, and the clergy are too well educated. And most of 'em
are 'class' too. It all tells.""

""Well, then, if our efforts aren't going to do any good, in a year or so
the public will notice that, and the public will stop subscribing.""

""Not a bit of it, Sam, you don't see as deep as I do. As long as we keep
the question prominent, it will be all right. First of all, we shall
always get the Nonconformist contribution. In every town, the
Nonconformist minister can be trusted to stir up people against a
Ritualistic 'priest,' especially if he's vowed to celibacy. Married ones
get on better. But what I'm coming to is this: All over Hengland there
are parishes where the vicar is more or less of a Romaniser. But he's
personally liked, perhaps, or no one makes the protest. But in every
parish, experience shows there's two or three prominent folk who hate
the vicar. Now, where there's a spark a flame can be got. It's all very
well to go and protest in a parish where there's a strong feeling
against Ritualism--like St. Elwyn's, for example. But think of the
hundreds of parishes where people jog along quite content, not knowing
the darkness in which they're groping! Now, we'll stir these places up,
we'll raise the flag of the League in places which have been going along
quiet and peaceable for years. There won't be a church from which we
can't get some people away. The Luther League shall become a household
word from John o' Groat's to Land's End.""

""Good scheme, Father, if you can do it. But think of the work, and think
of the risks of letting any one else into the League. We might find
ourselves in the second place some day.""

""Not at all, Sam. Not as I've worked it out. You ought to know that I
never start anything without going careful into the details.""

""Sorry, Father. Let's have the plan.""

""I'm going to start a band of 'Luther Lecturers' to carry Protestant
Truth into the 'idden places. I'm beginning with six young fellows I've
got. They'll travel all over the country, holding open-air meetings of
agitation, with a collection for the League--making public protests in
such churches as I give the order to be gone for, and lecturing on what
Ritualism really is. Now, these chaps will have two lectures. I've had
'em written already. One's on the Mass, another's on the
confessional,--hot Protestant stuff. They'll go like wild fire. The
young men'll learn these lectures off by heart and deliver 'em with
local allusions to the vicars of the parishes as they come to. I've got
a supply of the illegal wafers as the Ritualists use for the Lord's
Supper. Each lecture'll have one or two to show in the meetings. He'll
pull it out and show the poor deluded people the god of flour and water
their priests tell 'em to worship. There's lots of real humour in the
lectures. They'll fire the popular imagination. Every crowd likes to
hear a parson abused. I got the idea of humour and fun in the lectures
from the Salvation Army. You see, we want to reach the class of folk as
don't mind standing round a street-corner meeting and listening. The
Army makes it pay wonderfully! But they only attack sin. They don't
bother what a man does as long as he's good. We're attacking Rome in the
Henglish Church, and it's remarkable what a lot of ridiculous things and
points I've got into these lectures. There's one thing, for instance,
that'll keep all a crowd on the grin--I mean the directions to a
'priest' if an insect gets into the 'consecrated' wine. It has to be
burnt. Can't you see the lecturer with his 'Now, my friends, I ask you
what a poor little spider's done to be used like that?' It's all an
unworked mine! And you see there's no answer to it! A Ritualist 'priest'
who comes to argue--of course, discussion will be invited--is bound to
get left. He'll be so solemn and that, that the ordinary man in the
street won't understand a word he's driving at. My men'll win every
time. You'll see.""

""As usual, Pa,"" said Sam, ""you've hit on a good thing. It'll extend the
League wonderful. But what about your men--where'll you get 'em? and
what guarantee will you have that they won't rob the League?""

""Oh, that's all thought out. I shall have quite young chaps and pay them
about eighteen shillings a week and travelling expenses. Each two or
three days they'll have to send in reports as to the work, and each week
forward the collection. I shall try, eventually, to get real earnest
young men who believe in our glorious Henglish Protestant 'eritage.
_They_ won't rob us. I shall get smart young chaps with plenty of bounce
and go, but not much education. It's not _wanted_ for popular
street-corner work. You get a Ritualist parson coming to try and answer
one of my chaps--take the crucifix question, now. My man will talk about
Popish idols and that--it's all in the lecture--and all the parson will
say is that a crucifix is legal in the Church of Hengland--I believe, as
a strict matter of fact, it _is_. Then my man turns round and tells the
crowd that a crucifix is nothing but a dolly on a stick--he gets the
laugh, see? The 'priest' can't explain all his humbugging reverence and
that in an open-air meeting, with one of my chaps ready with a joke
every time he speaks. I've got four out of my six men already, and if
the thing hums as I expect, I'll put twenty or thirty in the field at
once. They're easy found! There's lots of young chaps connected with
chapels that would far rather tour the country attracting attention
wherever they go, and do nothing but agitate, than work hard! There's
young Moffatt, Peter Moffatt's son. He's a plumber, but he 'ates work.
He's got cheek for twenty, and he'll do no end of good. As for the cost,
why, the men will pay for themselves over and over again. They'll be
well supplied from the central office--extracts from the papers and so
on--they'll take local halls and advertise in local papers. I shall
expect that each man, if he's any good _at all_, will pay all his own
expenses each week and forward a clear two pounds to me! A man that
can't do that, at least, with such backing as we can give him and such a
splendid war-cry--well, I wouldn't give twopence for him.""

""I see it all clear now,"" answered Sam, a flush of excitement coming
into his face. ""And besides the money and extension of the League there
will be splendid opportunities for you and me to run down now and then
to support our men and get an 'oliday--take Brighton, for instance! It's
full of Ritualists. A couple of men could spend a month there.""

""And take from two to three hundred pounds, I should think,"" said the
secretary, thoughtfully, ""besides dealing an 'orrid blow to the wolves
in the fold of the Protestant Henglish Church. We'll have some good
protests in Brighton! Then, when our lecturers are fined for brawling,
we'll instruct them _not to pay the fine_, but to go to prison for a
fortnight instead! Of course, it'll be considered 'andsomely in their
salaries. Then we'll send them round the country with a magic lantern
and a rousing lecture. 'Imprisoned by the Romanisers,' 'In Gaol for the
Protestant Faith!' or something like that.""

""That's _fine_,"" said Sam, in an ecstasy of enjoyment. ""Why, Father, the
whole thing grows like a snowball! It _must_ grow.""

""Didn't I tell you, six months ago?"" said Mr. Hamlyn. ""Look at us then
and now! What were we then? Nothing, 'ardly. What are we now? Directors
of a big concern, becoming known all over Hengland, drawing good
salaries, and with all the pleasure of bossing a big show. Look at the
printing account the works have against the League, look at our expenses
when we've got thirty or more Luther lecturers all over the country! And
yet there's nothing risky in it. Nothing at all. No bogus-company
promoting, no snide article to sell. We've no limited-liability company
act to fear, no treasury investigations. We stand upon solid rock and
nobody can't touch us! And why? Because we are championing the freedom
of the people's religion, we are fighting for glorious Protestantism!""

""Fancy no one thinking of it before!"" said Sam.

Mr. Hamlyn's shrewd, able face beamed with merriment. ""Providence,"" he
said, ""chooses its own instruments. Now, then, send me in the shorthand
clerk; I shall be at work all day. To-night I address a public meeting
in the 'Olborn Town Hall, and before ten I'm due to sup with Miss
Pritchett. She wants something definite done in St. Elwyn's, and I must
think out a slap in the face for Blantyre.""

""I'll run round to the bank,"" said Sam, ""and pay this morning's little
lot into the general fund, and post the statement to the treasurer.""

""Right, my son. What was it?""

""Seventeen pounds odd, Pa.""

""Protestants are waking up,"" said Mr. Hamlyn, ""our work for the Cause
has a blessing upon it.""




CHAPTER VIII

A PRIVATE CONFERENCE AT MIDNIGHT A YEAR LATER


It was late at night in Father Blantyre's study at Hornham. King and
Stephens had gone to bed, but the vicar sat with Dr. Hibbert, his
churchwarden.

Both men were smoking. By the side of the doctor stood a modest peg of
whiskey; the priest contented himself with a glass of soda-water. The
candles by which the room was lighted showed that Mr. Blantyre's face
was very worn and weary. He seemed a man who was passing through a time
of stress and storm. The bronzed countenance of the doctor wore its
usual aspect of serenity and strength. Both men had been talking
together earnestly for a great part of the night. A true and intimate
friendship obtained between them, and it was a plan that fortnightly
they should meet thus and make confidences to each other about that
which they held so dear.

""It is just a year,"" Blantyre said, ""since Hamlyn committed his first
sacrilege in our own church.""

""The time goes very fast,"" Hibbert answered, ""yet look at the changes!
The man has become almost a power in the land, or at least he seems to
be. It is his talent for organisation. It's supreme. Look how this
wretched 'League' has grown. It has its spies and agents everywhere, its
committee has names of importance among its members, the amount of money
that rolls into Hamlyn's coffers must be very large.""

""I'm afraid so. But think of the turmoil and unrest one man can
create--the misery and pain churchmen feel every day now as they see the
jocose blasphemies of these people and see the holiest things held up to
an utterly vulgar and soulless ridicule. It's a wrong thought, Hibbert,
perhaps, but I do sometimes long to be out of it all, to start afresh on
such new work as God may give one in another life!""

""Such a thought comes to all of us at times, of course. But it's
physical mainly. It's merely a languor of overstrain and a weak nervous
state. You know yourself how such thoughts come chiefly at night, and
how after your tub, in the morning light and air they all go.""

""Materialist! But you're right, Hibbert, quite right.""

""You go on taking the physic I've sent you and you'll pick up soon. But,
of course, this _is_ a very trying time. The parish is in a constant
turmoil. These Sunday evening Protestant meetings when folk are coming
out of church are a bad nuisance. That's a new move, too.""

""Yes. They found that the hooligan riot-provoking business was very
simply dealt with, and so they are trying this. It is that poor, silly
old creature, Miss Pritchett. The Hamlyns are hand and glove with her. I
suppose she is sincere, poor old lady! I hope so. She was an ardent
Catholic, and I hope she does honestly believe in the new substitute for
the Faith. I am very sorry for her.""

""I'm less charitable, Blantyre; she's a spiteful old cat. I am not
violating any professional confidence in telling _you_ that she won't
live long if she goes on living in the thick of this noisy Protestant
agitation. I do my best for her, of course, but she won't do as she's
told.""

""She's a nuisance,"" the vicar said, ""but I hope she won't go yet. I
should like to make friends with her before she dies. And I should like
her to die in the Faith.""

""She won't do that, I'm afraid, Blantyre. She has gone too far away from
the Church. But, now, what do you honestly think the effect of this
Luther crusading business has been on the Church.""

""Well, I think there can be no doubt of that. I was talking it over with
Lord Huddersfield last week and we both agreed. The _Church_ has gained
enormously. People who were simply attracted by ceremonial and what was
novel to them have gone out, in a restless endeavour to find some new
thing. But that is all. Our congregations here, our communicants, have
grown very much. There is a deeper spiritual fervour among us, I am sure
of it. No churchman has taken Hamlyn seriously for a moment. He has
failed in every attempt he has made to interfere with our teaching or
our ceremonial, failed absolutely. All his legal cases have fallen
through, or proved abortive, or are dragging on towards extinction. The
days of ritual prosecutions are utterly dead. All the harm Hamlyn has
done the Church itself is to weary our ears and hearts with a great
noise and tumult, with floods of empty talk. He has stung our nerves,
he hasn't penetrated to any vital part.""

""Yes, that is so. It needs more than the bellowings of such a man, more
than the hostility of people who are not members of the Church, to hurt
her in any serious degree. The man and his friends have a large rabble
behind them, but they can only parade through the streets of England
beating their drums and rattling their collecting boxes. The Church is
safe.""

""It is. And yet in another way, all this business is doing fearful harm
to the _morale_ of the country, limited though it may be. The mass of
non-Christian people who might be gathered into the Church are looking
down upon these unseemly contests with a sneer. They feel that there can
be little good or truth in a system of philosophy which seems to them to
be nothing but an arena of brawling fools. Therein comes the harm.
Hamlyn isn't injuring church people, he is giving contraband of war to
infidelity. And just at this particular moment in the world's history
this is extremely dangerous. In thirty years, the danger will have
passed away; to-day, it is great.""

""And why particularly at this moment?""

""Why, because the world is utterly changing with extraordinary rapidity.
That world which once adjusted itself so sweetly to our faith is
vanishing, is gone. The new world which is arriving is unassimilated,
unsorted, unexplained. The light hasn't entered it yet, it doesn't know
how to correspond. The trouble lies in that. The new politics, science,
philosophy, art, are only social habits. And these will not talk our
language yet, or confess Christ. And this squabble and turmoil will
retard the new adjustment for years, because outsiders won't even
trouble to examine our claims or make experience of our system. _And
people are glad of any excuse to ignore or at least avoid Christianity._
You see, a new religion has sprung up.""

""Yes--go on.""

""It is the religion of pleasure, excitement, nervous thrill bought at
any cost. Renan, who had eyes and used them, saw that. He has given us
the hint in his _Abbess of Jouarre_. 'Were the human race quite
certain,' he says, 'that in two or three days the world would come to an
end, the instinct of pleasure'--_l'amour_ is his word--'would break out
into a sort of frenzy; in the presence of death, sure and sudden,
nature alone would speak, and very strange scenes would follow. The
social order is preserved by restraint; but restraint depends upon a
belief in a hereafter.' And already, 'If a man dies, shall he live
again?' is the burden of a new soliloquy on the lips of a new Hamlet.
Faith is becoming more and more an act, a habit, of heroism. So you see
the harm Hamlyn and his gang are indirectly doing. But do you know where
it seems to me the great counteracting influence to his work lies at the
moment?""

""Where?""

""You will wonder to hear me say so, but I firmly think for the moment it
lies in the ranks, and true love of our Lord, of the pious Evangelical
Party in the Church! They are Catholic without knowing it. They think,
and think sincerely, that the forms the Church has appointed, some of
her Sacraments even, obscure the soul's direct communion with God. They
are not in line with us yet. But there is a sterling and vivid
Christianity among them. There is a personal adoration of Jesus which is
strong and sweet, a living, wonderful thing. And, you see, all this
section of the Church is exempt from the attacks of the _extreme_
Protestants--who seem themselves to have hardly any Christianity at all.
Nor do the really pious Evangelicals approve of this civil war. They
won't be mixed up in it. They are far too busy doing good works and
preparing themselves for the next world to join in these rowdy
processions of the shallow, the ill-informed, or the malevolent. They
don't approve of _us_, of course, but they have no public quarrel with
what they see is substantially powerful for good. Since Hamlyn's brigade
has been throwing mud at us, and we, of course, have defended ourselves
to the best of our ability, the minds of those who are eager to justify
their adhesion to the religion of pleasure cannot, at least if they have
any logic or sincerity, avoid a consideration of the quiet
Evangelicals.""

""It is a new idea to me,"" said the doctor, refilling his pipe, ""but I
suppose you are right. They despise the whole business of agitation, and
yet don't make it a pretext as the rationalists are glad to do. The
whole thing is a miserable business! What annoys _me_, Vicar, is the
facility with which a rowdy, ignorant man of the lower classes has been
able to make himself a force.""

""It is hard. But one must remember that however sincere he is--and I
know nothing against his personal character--he only appeals to the
ignorant and rowdy. Have you seen his new leaflet?""

""No, I think not. What is it?""

""It came by post last night; apparently the whole district is being
circularised. Really, the thing is quite a curiosity. I will read you a
few paragraphs.""

He opened a drawer and took a small pamphlet from it, which was headed
""THE HORNHAM SCANDAL."" ""Listen to this:

""'At St. Elwyn's, Hornham,' writes a lady member of the Luther League,
'I recently attended the so-called ""High Mass."" There were three priests
in vestments; there were eight candles burning at eleven o'clock on the
altar; there was incense and all the appurtenances of a Roman Mass; the
men bore that ignorant and unwashed appearance which is commonly to be
seen at any time in an Italian church. At times they crossed themselves,
but often they seemed to forget, and then suddenly to remember. I stayed
as long as I could, but it was not long, for I was sick at heart at the
thought of what our country is being mercilessly dragged into, and that
it is for services of this description that we hear from time to time
our foolish girls exclaim, ""How I hate the name of Protestant.""'""

""Elegant style,"" said the doctor dryly, ""but to call our congregation
'unwashed' is not only perfectly untrue, but a little touch of feminine
spite that shows the spirit in which these crusades are carried on. I
wonder how many of the five thousand were unwashed when our Lord fed
them!""

""That is a quotation,"" said the vicar, ""now hear the robuster prose of
the great Hamlyn himself:

""'It appears that there are literally no lengths of lawlessness,
ecclesiastical insubordination, blasphemous poperies, or unscriptural
profanation of places of worship to which Ritualistic innovators will
not proceed. Among other Romanising acts of the vicar of St. Elwyn's,
the notorious ""Father"" Blantyre, is a direction to some of his
congregation who attend the Lord's Supper. These members have taken the
bread from him--or rather the superstitious wafer which is substituted
for bread--with the thumb and finger. ""Oh, no,"" says our priest, ""you
must hold out your hand for it."" These are the ""instructions"" of
""Father"" Blantyre to those about to attend the Lord's Supper for the
first time after confirmation:

""'_As soon as the priest comes up to you, hold up your hands as high as
the chin, so that he may place the Blessed Sacrament in your hand while
he says the words, The Body of our Lord._

""'But we ask our Protestant brethren how, if the minister--falsely
called ""priest""--places the bread in the hand of the communicant, how
the latter can comply with the direction ""take this""? Let England awake
to this ""priestly"" and insidious Popish plan.'""

""Well!"" said the doctor, ""of all the--"" Words failed him.

""Isn't it vulgar and childish!"" said the vicar, ""but how admirably
adapted to suit the ignorant folk who will read it. The adroit
substitution of a colloquial use of the word 'take' for its real meaning
of 'receive'! And then the continual effort to degrade the Mass, to rob
it of its mystery and holy character--it's clever, it's subtle. Hamlyn
is a man of parts!""

""Is there any more?""

""Oh, yes, plenty. So far I have only read the mildest parts. Here is a
distorted simile which I should hardly have thought even Hamlyn would
have printed. It is painful to read:

""'One of our Luther Lecturers recently asked a poor, deluded young
female who is in the habit of attending the pantomime at St. Elwyn's why
she went there. The poor, deluded creature replied--doubtless with words
put into her mouth by her ""Father Confessor""--that its ""spirituality""
and ""devotion"" attracted her. Ah! Rome and Ritualism have ever known how
to appear as a pure and modest virgin, even when rotting (to use the
image of the Holy Spirit in the Word) with fornication. O foolish young
woman! How have you been bewitched with these sorceries? A clean thing
is to be got of an unclean thing!'""

The doctor ground his teeth. ""I wish we'd had the man in the regiment!""
he said. ""Unclean! I'd have cleaned the brute!""

The vicar sighed. ""Of course it doesn't really matter,"" he said. ""This
sort of stuff carries its own condemnation with it. Still it is most
distressing. It does wound one deeply to hear the highest and holiest
things spoken of in this way. All my people feel it. Some of them--poor
things--have come to me weeping to hear such words--weeping for shame
and sorrow. Here is the last paragraph. The pamphlet concludes with a
fine flow of rhetoric, and an invitation to me:

""'The late Dr. Parker said: ""Popery is the vilest blasphemy out of hell.
It is the enemy of liberty; it is the enemy of intelligence; it is the
enemy of individuality, of conscience, and responsibility; it is the
supreme wickedness of the world, the master effort of the devil.""

""'And so say we. Therefore, honest, English, Protestant people of
Hornham, look to it that these doings in your midst are put down with a
stern hand. A great meeting of ratepayers will shortly be held in the
Victoria Hall under the auspices of the Luther League. A lecture, with
lime-light views, will be delivered on the cloaked and hooded Popery
that stalks in our midst. An invitation will be extended to ""Fathers""
Blantyre, King, and Stephens, the ""Priests"" of St. Elwyn's church, who
will be accommodated with seats upon the platform if they care to come.
We of the Luther League invite them to public controversy, to an open
debate upon the great questions at issue. Will they be present? Time
will show.'""

Hibbert rose. ""Well, it's time we were in bed,"" he said. ""Good-night. I
should think over that sporting offer of Hamlyn's if I were you. A
public appearance might do good. I like a fight.""

""I doubt it,"" the vicar answered; ""still, it may be worth considering.
One never knows. One doesn't want people to say that one is afraid.""

""Good-night, Vicar.""

""Good-night, Hibbert. Forget all about these surface worries and sleep
well.""

The vicar was left alone.

He took a letter from his pocket. It was from Lucy, who wrote from Park
Lane. In the letter, she said that she purposed--if he would care to
have her--to come down to Hornham at once and spend some months at the
clergy-house.

""If you can put up with a girl for a time in your bachelor stronghold!
I'm sick to death of this life; it has lost all its attractions for me.
I want to _live_, not play, and you, my dear old boy, will show me the
way. A letter is no way--for me--to tell you of my thoughts. But higher
things than of old are working in me. St. Elwyn's calls me, it seems
home; I so often think of the big quiet church and the ceaseless
activity that centres round it. I long for the peace there! I have much
to tell you, much to consult you about, and I am beginning to wonder why
I have left you alone so long. Good-night, dear.""

Putting down the letter, he looked at the clock. It was now far after
midnight, and he stayed the hand that was about to raise the glass that
stood on the table beside him.

In a few hours it would be dawn, the dawn when in the dim hour he daily
went to meet the Lord in the Eucharist. How wonderful that was! What
unending joy the break of day had for this good man, as he began the
ancient and mysterious rite of the Church! There, there, beside the
altar, there was peace! In this desert world, that was so far from Home,
there was always that daily glimpse into the Unseen, that Communion in
which dead friends and great angels joined, when the Paraclete came to
the weary, sinful hearts of men like fire, when our Lord in his risen
majesty came to the world to hearten his soldiers, to fill his toiling
saints with power to continue to the end.

If only the whole world _knew_ and realised this! Sometimes the priest
thought with simple wonder, that if only men knew, all trouble and
sorrow would be over. To him the material world was the unreal place,
the dream, the fable. Daily he _knew_ that the Unseen was ever near,
close, close!--how blind and sorrowful the world was, that did not know
or care for Jesus.

He knelt down now to say his prayers. He prayed for the Church, his
congregation, for his sister, and his friends. Then he prayed that he
might be worthy to receive the Blessed Sacrament at dawn.

And then, happy, comforted, and at peace, with the certainty of an
unseen glory all round him, with august watchers to shield him through
the night, he sought his couch and slept a deep, dreamless sleep with
crossed hands.

""_From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks
of the Lord Jesus._""




CHAPTER IX

A UNION OF FORCES


In Hornham, the vast majority of a poor and teeming population was quite
without interest in any religious matter. The chapels of the various
sects were attended by the residuum, the congregations at St. Elwyn's
were large--to the full holding capacity of the mother church and the
smaller mission building--and a fair proportion of people worshipped at
St. Luke's, the only other church in the neighbourhood.

Mr. Carr, the vicar of St. Luke's, was a man of about thirty-five. He
had taken a good degree at Cambridge, spent a few years in various
curacies, and had been appointed vicar of St. Luke's, Hornham, which was
in the gift of an Evangelical body known as Simon's Trustees, about four
years before Mr. Hamlyn had thrown Hornham into its present state of
religious war.

The vicar of St. Luke's was a man of considerable mental power. He was
unmarried, had no private means, and lived a lonely, though active,
life in his small and ill-built vicarage. In appearance, he was tall,
somewhat thin, and he wore a pointed, close-cropped beard and moustache.
His face was somewhat melancholy, but when he was moved or interested,
the smile that came upon it was singularly sweet. In the ordinary
business of life, he was reserved and shy. He had none of the genial
Irish _bonhomie_ of Blantyre, the wholesome breezy boyishness of
Stephens, or the grim force of King. He had a ""personality""--to the
eye--but he failed to sustain the impression his appearance made in
talk. He was of no use in a drawing-room and very nearly a failure in
any social gathering. Those few members of his flock with whom, now and
again, he had to enter into purely social relations, said of him: ""Mr.
Carr is a thorough gentleman, but the poor fellow is dreadfully shy. He
wants a wife; perhaps she'd liven him up a bit.""

Such was the man in private life. In his clerical duties, as a
priest--or, as he would have put it, a pastor--his personal character
was sunk and merged in his office as completely as that of Father
Blantyre himself. His sermons were full of earnest exhortation, his
private ministrations were fervent and helpful, and there was a power in
his ministry that was felt by all with whom he came in contact.

He was distinctly and entirely what is known as an ""Evangelical,"" using
that fine word in the best and noblest sense. He belonged to a school of
thought which is rapidly becoming merged in and overlapped by others,
sometimes to its betterment, but more frequently to its destruction, but
which standing by itself is a powerful force.

He did not realise the state of transition in which he and other men of
his school must necessarily stand to-day. Their position, admirable as
it often is, is but a compromise. He did not as yet realise this.

Of Blantyre and the people at St. Elwyn's he knew little or nothing. He
had met the clergy there once or twice upon official occasions, but that
was all. He was too busy with his own work to have much time to attend
to that of other people, but he had the natural distaste of his school
and bringing-up for ceremonial and teaching of which he had no
experience, and merely regarded as foreign, anti-English, and on the
whole dangerous.

He was not a bigot, and the leading feature in his religion was this: He
assigned an absolute supremacy to Holy Scripture as the only rule of
faith and practice, the only test of truth, the only judge of
controversy. He did not think that there was any guide for man's soul
co-equal or co-ordinate with the Bible. He did not care to accept such
statements as ""the Church says so,"" ""primitive antiquity says so,"" or
""the Councils and the Fathers also say so,""--unless it could be shown to
his satisfaction that what is said is in harmony with Scripture.

Disregarding as superfluous all external and ""vicarious"" form in
religion, he attached paramount importance to the work and office of our
Lord, and the highest place to the inward work of the Holy Spirit in the
heart of man. And he attached tremendous importance to the outward and
visible work of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man. His supreme belief
was that the true grace of God is a thing that will always make itself
manifest in the behaviour, tastes, ways, and choices, of him who has it.
He thought, therefore, that it was illogical to tell men that they are
""children of God, and members of Christ, and heirs of the kingdom of
Heaven"" unless they had really overcome the world, the flesh, and the
devil. But he could not be stern or menacing in his dealings with
souls. The mercy of God was more in his thoughts, always and at all
times, than the wrath and judgment of God.

His attitude toward the pressing questions that were agitating the
Church of England, all over England, was in logical correspondence with
his beliefs. There was much within the Church that he had not understood
or realised as yet, but he was no Hamlyn, to break down and destroy all
that has made the Church of England what it is.

He neither undervalued the Church nor thought lightly of her privileges.
In sincere and loyal attachment to her, he would give place to none. His
apprehension of churchmanship was limited, that was all.

Nor did he--as far as he knew--under-value the Christian ministry. He
looked upon it as a high and honourable office instituted by Christ
Himself, and on priests as God's ambassadors, God's messengers, God's
stewards and overseers. Nevertheless he looked upon what he knew as
""sacerdotalism"" and ""priestcraft"" with unfeigned dislike and uneasiness.

He believed in baptism as the appointed means of regeneration and that
it conveyed grace _ex opere operato_; a position in which he was a
little in advance of some of his school. His views on the Eucharist were
hardly so sound, though there was nothing in them absolutely
antagonistic to the truths which he had not yet realised. He certainly
did not regard Holy Communion as the chief service in the Church, its
central point.

On outward things, he was sane enough. He liked handsome churches, good
ecclesiastical architecture, a well-ordered ceremonial, and a
well-conducted service. If any one had told Mr. Carr that he was as
nearly as possible ""Catholic"" in his views, that if they were logically
pushed forward to their proper development he would be practically one
with the St. Elwyn's people, he would first have been startled somewhat
unpleasantly, and then he would have laughed incredulously.

And if some one had gone to Blantyre and told him that Carr was thus, he
would have smiled rather sadly to think that his informant had realised
the truths taught by the Anglican Church in a very limited way.

This mutual misunderstanding between the only two schools of thought in
the Church of England that have enduring value is very common. The
_extreme_ Protestants are not church-people at all in any right sense
of the word. The ""Broad"" party are confused with their own shifting
surmises from day to day, and make too many ""discoveries"" to have real
and lasting influence. But the ""High Church"" people and the pious
""Evangelicals"" are extraordinarily close to one another, and neither
party realises the fact, while both would repudiate it. Yet both schools
of opinion are, after all, occupied with one end and aim to the
exclusion of all others--the attaining of personal holiness.

It was on a bright morning that Mr. Carr came down-stairs and
breakfasted, after he had read prayers with his two servants. There was
no daily service in St. Luke's, though evensong was said on Wednesdays
and Saturdays. He read his morning paper for a few moments, then put it
down and pushed his plate away. He was unable to eat, this morning.

He got up and walked uneasily about the room. His face was troubled and
sad. Then he pulled a letter from his pocket and read it with a doubtful
sigh. This was the letter:

     ""LUTHER LODGE,
     ""HORNHAM, N.

     ""DEAR SIR:

     ""Faithfully yours,

The clergyman read and reread the letter, hardly knowing what to make of
it. He had done so many times. The infinite condescension of it annoyed
him; the recapitulation of the writer's position seemed a piece of
impudent bravado, and reminded the vicar of St. Luke's of the unhappy
state that religious life was in at Hornham.

Some days before, shocked and distressed beyond measure at the growing
turmoil in Hornham, startled by the continued evidences of it that he
met with in his pastoral life, he had written to Mr. Hamlyn asking for a
private interview. He had shrunk from doing anything of the sort for
weeks. His whole nature revolted against it. But he had dimly recognised
that in some measure he might be said to be in a middle position between
the two conflicting parties, and thought that his mediation might be of
some avail. Repugnant as it was to him, he resolved that he must do
what he thought to be his duty, and after he had made it the subject of
anxious and fervent prayer he had made up his mind to see if he could
not prevail with the leader of the ""New Reformation"" to cease his
agitation, in Hornham at any rate. He imagined that Hamlyn could hardly
realise the harm he was doing to the true religious life in the place.
It was not his business to argue with the reformer about his work
elsewhere. He knew nothing of that. But in Hornham, at any rate, he did
see that the civil war provoked nothing but the evil passions of hatred
and malice, had no effect upon either party, and prevented the steady
preparation for heaven which he thought was the supreme business of
Christians.

Hamlyn's letter certainly didn't seem at all conciliatory. It disturbed
him. He had hardly ever spoken to the man in the past, but he had known
of him, as he necessarily knew of every tradesman in the borough. Social
considerations hardly ever entered his mind, but he had not thought of
Hamlyn as a potentate in any way when he had written to him. He knew him
for a plump, shrewd, vulgar man, who dropped his aspirates and said
""paiper"" for ""paper,"" and, indeed, had thought none the worse of him
for that. But the letter surprised him. It was almost offensive, and he
was as near anger as a gentle-minded man may be.

At half-past ten o'clock, he sighed, realising that a most distasteful
duty had to be done, and prepared to leave the house. Before he left his
study, he knelt down and prayed for a blessing in his mission. He always
prayed before any event of any importance in life. An enormous number of
people still do, and it is a very great pity that some people do not
believe or realise the fact. Prayer is not the anachronism many
publicists would have us believe. If among all classes, Christians by
open profession, and people who make no profession at all, save only
contempt for Christianity, a census of prayers prayed during one day
could be taken, the result would be very remarkable indeed. It would
certainly startle the rationalists. Statistics show that every second a
child is born and a person dies. It is during the approach of such
occasions that even people who call themselves ""atheists"" generally
pray. Ask hospital nurses, doctors, or parish priests! There is no
greater humbug than the pretence that prayer as a general necessity and
practice is dead. There is more irreligion visible to-day than at any
other time in English history, perhaps. But that does not mean that
people do not pray. The majority live a jolly, godless life till they
are frightened. Then they pray. The minority pray always.

Mr. Carr left his house with a more vigorous step after his petition. As
so many folk know, the help that comes from prayer is only
self-hypnotism--of course. But it is certainly odd what power some of
the least gifted and most ordinary people have of this self-hypnotism.
One had always thought it rather a cryptic science, the literature of
India, for example, regarding it as a supreme achievement. But it must
be very simple after all! And if the help that comes to the human heart
after prayer _is_ a result of this magnetic power, all we can say is
that in the depths of a Whitechapel slum, the outcast, forgotten, and
oppressed have each and all the most remarkable, delicate, and cultured
temperaments, not in the least seared or spoilt by privation and want.
The only point that one quite fails to understand is, why are the
leading reviews and scientific publications still discussing this art,
or talent, as something rare, abnormal, and as yet little understood?

Mr. Carr drew near to ""Luther Lodge."" ""Balmoral"" had been deserted for
some time by the Hamlyn family, who very properly felt that it was
beneath the dignity of its celebrated head, and would also be harmful to
the glorious Protestant cause, if they remained among the
undistinguished inhabitants of Beatrice Villas.

About the time that this decision had been arrived at, a substantial
square house, unornamental but sound--like Protestantism itself--was
vacated by its former inhabitant, the Mayor of Hornham, a
leather-dresser in a large way, who had sold his business to a company
and was retiring to the country. Mr. Hamlyn looked over the place--then
known as Hide-side House--and saw that it would exactly suit him and his
altered fortunes. He changed the name to ""Luther Lodge,"" made some
extensive purchases of furniture, and established himself there with his
son and daughter.

Carr drew near to the iron gates before the circular sweep of gravel
known to the past and present inhabitants of the house as the ""drive.""
The gates were hung from two stone pilasters, each surmounted by a small
but extremely rampant lion, fiercely Protestant of aspect and painted a
dull purple. The whole aspect of the place was chilling, as the
clergyman walked up to the door. The formal lace curtains in the
windows, the brilliant black-leaded boot-scraper which reflected the
sunlight in a dozen facets of vicious leaden fire, the great apple of
shining brass which was the bell-pull--all these affected him in an
unpleasant manner. He was supremely unconscious of any artistic likings
or knowledge, but the seeds of them were latent in him nevertheless, and
the place hurt his senses in a strange way.

A trim maid came to the door, the extreme antithesis of the
filibustering ""general"" of a year ago, and showed him into the hall.

""I'll see if master's disengaged,"" she said; ""are you the gentleman as
has an appointment with master for eleven?""

Mr. Carr confessed to being that gentleman and the girl left him
standing there. From some room in the upper part of the house, so it
seemed, the tinkling notes of a piano came down to him. Some one--it was
Miss Hamlyn herself--was singing fervently of ""violets, violets, I will
wear for thee.""

After a considerable interval, the maid came back. ""Master will see you
now, sir,"" she said, and ushered the visitor into Mr. Hamlyn's study.

It was a fair-sized room with a long French window opening upon a lawn
in the centre of a small, walled garden. Many book-shelves filled with
grave and portly tomes lined the walls, a large writing-table stood in
the middle of the carpet. Some months before, a struggling firm of
""religious publishers"" had failed, and their stock of theology was
thrown upon a flooded market as ""Remainders."" Mr. Hamlyn, as being in
the trade himself, was enabled to acquire a library suited to his
position at remarkably cheap rates.

Mr. Hamlyn rose from his chair.

""Glad to see you,"" he said hastily, and with great condescension and
good humour. ""Fortunate I happened to have a morning free. Now, what can
I do for you? No spiritual trouble, I hope? Ritualists been prowling
round St. Luke's? If so, say the word, give me the facts, and I'll see
you are protected!""

""It is on a question connected with the state of affairs in the district
that I called to see you, Mr. Hamlyn.""

""Quite so, Mr. Carr, just what I expected. Well, I've always heard good
accounts of you as a loyal Protestant minister--though I can't approve
of your using that pestilential book, _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, in
your church--and I will do what I can for you. Providence has placed a
scourge in my hand to drive the idolaters from the Temple, so tell me
your trouble.""

Carr had listened to this, which was delivered in a loud, confident
voice, with growing amazement. He hardly knew how to take the man.

""I deplore very much,"" he said, making a great effort, ""the state into
which Hornham has been thrown. I cannot, of course, approve of much that
I understand takes place at St. Elwyn's. Yet I am beginning to fear that
the remedy is worse than the disease. I am sure, Mr. Hamlyn, that your
great desire must be to see the people led to love the Lord Jesus and to
live godly, sober lives. Well, I find that the crusade of the Luther
League is unsettling the minds of weaker brethren. They are becoming
excited, forgetful of duty, carried away by the flood of a popular
movement. All this is hurtful to souls. Men should have peace to make
themselves right with God. Strife and anger hurt the soul and wound it.
Now I have no concern with any other place but this, in which my
ministry is set. But in Hornham, at least, I have come to ask you to
moderate your attacks upon the High Church party, to extend to them the
same tolerance they extend to us.""

Hamlyn stared at the speaker.

""To moderate MY methods?"" he shouted in a coarse voice. ""Do you know
what you're asking? Do you realise who I am?""

""Perfectly, Mr. Hamlyn,"" the clergyman answered with considerable
dignity. ""I am speaking, I hope, to a brother Christian, and as such, in
the name of our dear Lord, I ask you to cease this strife and discord
among us. God will show his desires in his own way; prayer is a more
powerful weapon than public invective. And it is idle to deny that the
vicar of St. Elwyn's and his curates are doing good. I believe their
teaching on fundamental truths is wrong, I deprecate the ceremonial with
which they veil and cover the simple beauties of the Christian faith.
But Mr. Blantyre is a good and noble-hearted man. He gives his life and
his large income--it is a matter of common knowledge--to the service of
the poor and needy. He is utterly unselfish, he loves Jesus. Let him
work in his own way in peace.""

Mr. Hamlyn's face grew very red. The man was mentally bloated by
prosperity and success. Daily he was hailed by fools as the saviour of
his country, his name was on many lips, and his sense of proportion was
utterly gone.

""Really!"" he said, ""of all the mad requests as was ever made me this is
the maddest! Are you in your senses, Mr. Carr--you a Protestant minister
of the Word? You can't be. You come to me, me, who Providence has set at
the head of Henglish Protestantism, and ask me to join a base conspiracy
to silence the clarion of Truth! to leave my 'igh ground of Principle
and grovel before a petticoated 'priest'! Why, you're asking me to let
the Pope and the devil into Hornham. Have you ever cast your eye upon
the works of the immortal John Bunyan? What about Mr. Facing-both-ways?""

Mr. Carr kept his temper. He was there upon an important issue. What did
it matter if the man was rude? ""But don't you think, as a Christian,"" he
said mildly, ""that it is hard enough to fight the devil, the world, and
the flesh without private differences in the Christian camp?""

""Who's speaking of Christians?"" Hamlyn cried; ""not I. Blantyre is no
Christian; he is doing the devil's work, which is the work of Rome. He
gives away his money because the devil showed him that it was a good
move, to win souls to Rome. As for his goodness, how do we know what
goes on in the confessional? I've heard----""

Carr stood up. ""Let me tell you at once, sir,"" he said in a hard voice
and with flashing eyes, ""that any scandal and slander you make before me
about a man I know to be pure and good I will at once repeat to him, and
you will have to take the consequences.""

""Ah!"" said the agitator sharply and suddenly and with his impudent smile
flashing over his face, mingled with a sneer, ""I see now! I ought to
have seen it before. You are a wolf in sheep's clothing! While we all
thought you a faithful Protestant, you have secretly joined causes with
the enemy. The cloven 'oof 'as peeped out! You come as a sneaking
ambassador of Rome in the garb of a Protestant. The Jesuits have been
having a go at you, Mr. Carr, and they've got you! I shouldn't wonder if
you've got your 'air-shirt on now! Go back to them as sent you and say
that I've scourged 'em with whips in the past and I'll give 'em
scorpions now. This will make a fine story at our next meeting in the
public 'all!""

Carr turned on his heel without a word and left the room. He crossed the
hall in a couple of strides, opened the door, and walked quickly over
the gravel sweep. As his hand was on the latch of the gate, the
reformer's voice hailed him. Mr. Hamlyn was looking round the corner of
the door; a genial grin--a clown's grin--lay upon his face. ""Mr. Carr!""
he bawled with unabashed and merry impudence, ""been to Mass yet?""

Then, with a final chuckle, he closed the door.

The peacemaker walked sadly away. He saw at once the sort of man he had
been dealing with, and recognised how futile any protest would be in the
case. He saw clearly how unassailable Hamlyn's position was, while the
country was full of people who would pay him to keep them in a state of
pleasurable excitement. It was better than the theatre to which Hamlyn's
subscribers loudly protested that their consciences would not allow them
to go! It was a sort of bull-baiting revived; the lust of the public at
seeing some one hunted was satisfied.

How infinitely better the sober methods of the old-established
Protestant societies were! Legitimate propaganda, a dignified and
scholarly controversy, these were right and sane. But this clown's
business, this noise and venom, was utterly disgusting. He had caught a
glimpse into the machinery of the whole movement that sickened him.

He went home to his lonely house and made a frugal lunch. Something
ought to be done, but what? He was not a man to fail in any efforts he
made in a good cause. He did not propose to cease his attempts to
restore Hornham to decent calm, even now. But he could not see, at the
moment, what was the next move he should make.

During the afternoon he set out on a round of parochial visiting. He sat
by the bedsides of the sick, the querulous, the ungrateful, and told his
message of comfort. He heard much of Hamlyn's campaign. The new leaflet
with its violent language was thrust into his hand. Every one wondered
what would happen next. Would Mr. Blantyre face the Luther Lecturers in
the public hall? One old bedridden dame Carr found all agog with
excitement and spite. ""It'd come to a fight,"" she expected, and ""wot an
awful thing it was to have them wicked monsters the Papists so close.
She could 'ardly sleep o' nights thinking of it all."" Carr found that
the poor old creature had not the remotest idea of what ""Papist"" meant,
of what anything meant, indeed; but she would hardly listen to his
prayers and Bible-reading nevertheless, so eager was she to discuss the
""goings on.""

About four, as he left the last house he purposed to visit just then, a
strange thought came to him suddenly. He was at the extreme end of his
parish, not far from St. Elwyn's. Would it not be a good thing to go and
visit Blantyre, to express his sympathy and to discuss whether some way
out of the present trouble could not be found?

The idea strengthened and grew. He knew Blantyre was a decent
fellow--every one said so. But, nevertheless, he had the sense of
venturing into the lion's den! He should feel strange among these
priests with their foreign ways, their cassocks and berrettas; there
would be discomfort in the visit.

It is curious how, in the minds of the least prejudiced, the dislike to
the definite and outward symbols that a priest wears still lingers. In
another generation, it will have been swept away, but it still survives
as a relic of the dark, secularising influences of the eighteenth
century. And, again, the man in the street does not like to be reminded
that there is a God and a class of men vowed to His service, and the
complete distinction of a priest's costume is too explicit a reminder.

Carr thought the matter out for a minute or two and then made up his
mind. He would go and talk over the situation with Blantyre. With a
vivid sense of how his host of the morning would call his action ""bowing
down in the house of Rimmon,"" a sense that only quickened his steps and
sent a contemptuous curl to his lip, he turned and walked towards the
clergy-house.

He rang the bell, and a tall and rather hulking man in livery showed him
into a large drawing-room. This was the navvy, Mr. King's former
assailant, who had been promoted, at his own request, to a distinctive
costume, which he wore with pride and diligence. His only grief was that
he was not allowed to ""wipe the floor with that there Hamlyn,"" but he
lived in hope that some fresh outrage would provide him with the
necessary permission.

Carr looked round the room. There was nothing ecclesiastical about it,
no flavour of the monk at home. It had been newly papered; the walls
were covered with pictures so fresh and new in treatment that they might
have come from the Academy of that year. The vicar of St. Luke's
suddenly awoke to the fact that he was in a very charming room indeed.
There was a Steinway grand piano there, a beautiful instrument; he saw
that the Twelfth Nocturne of Chopin stood open upon it. Everywhere he
saw a multitude of photographs in frames of silver, copper, ivory,
peacock leather--every imaginable sort of frame. A great many of these
photographs were signed in the corner, and looking at some of them he
was surprised to see that they were of very well-known people. Here was
a well-known general, there a judge, again the conscious features of a
society actor beamed out at him. His eye, unobservant at first, began to
take in the details of the room more rapidly. There were a hundred
luxurious little trifles scattered about, numerous contrivances for
comfort. He was wondering to whom this room could belong, when the door
opened and his doubts were resolved.

A girl came in, a girl with a beautifully modelled face, healthy and yet
without crimson in it. A pair of frank, dark eyes looked at him from
beneath an overshadowing mass of dead black hair.

""How do you do, Mr. Carr,"" she said,--he had given the man his card,--""I
am Mr. Blantyre's sister; I've only just pitched my tent in Hornham.
Bernard will be in for tea in half an hour.""

Rather nervously, Carr explained that he had called on a matter of
parochial business. He remained standing, a little at a loss. This girl
was not like the young ladies of Hornham.

""Well, you must have some tea,"" Lucy said with decision as she rang the
bell. Carr sat down. He anticipated a somewhat trying half hour until
the vicar should arrive. He was a gentleman, well bred in every way, but
his life, from the time of his school days, had been lonely and without
much feminine companionship.

In five minutes he found, to his own great surprise, that he was talking
vividly and well, that he was quite pleased to be where he was. And the
girl seemed to be interested and pleased with him. It was a very new
sensation, this feeling of mutual liking, to the lonely man. The
conversation turned naturally to the unrest around them. Carr said
nothing as yet of his morning's experience.

""Well, I must confess, frankly, Mr. Carr,"" Lucy said, ""that until lately
I never took any interest at all in these things. They seemed humbug to
me. Now, of course, I know better. It's a _shame_! a black shame, that
Bernard and the others should be treated so by this disgusting man. If
he only knew what their life was! how self-denying, how full of
unceasing labour and worry, how devoted. Take Mr. Stephens, for
instance: he's only a boy, yet he's killing himself with work and
enthusiasm. He was up all last night with a man that has delirium
tremens, yet he said Mass at half-past seven, came to breakfast as merry
as a sand-boy, and was teaching in the national schools at nine. And
he'll be on his feet to-day until nearly midnight without a word of
complaint. He'll spend nearly the whole evening in the boys' club,
boxing and playing billiards with them--oh, you can't think how the
three of them work!""

She went on with a series of anecdotes and explanations, told with great
vividness and power, in her new enthusiasm for the men among whom she
had come. And throughout all her talk, the clergyman heard frequent
references to the services that went on almost unceasingly in the great
church hard by. He heard names, strange and yet familiar, startling to
his ear, and yet which seemed quite natural and fitting in the place
where he was. One thing he began to see clearly, and with interest:
whatever these men were in opinion, a life of real and active holiness
went on among them. And he noticed also, with wonder, how everything
seemed to draw its inspiration from the church, how constantly the
clergy were there, hearing confessions, saying services, praying, and
preaching. The whole thing was new to him.

They were the best of friends, talking brightly together, when the door
burst open and the impetuous priest rushed in. ""Well, I'm glad to see
you!"" he said with a broad grin of welcome. ""Had tea?--that's right. I
see you've made friends with my clergywoman! I've been in church hearing
confessions, or I'd have been in sooner.""

His manner was extremely genial. He seemed genuinely glad to see his
brother vicar and not in the least surprised or puzzled.

Carr looked attentively at him. So this merry Irishman, with the lined,
powerful face, the grey hair, and eyes which sometimes blazed out like
lamps--this was the great Ritualist, the Jesuit, the thief of English
liberty!

He had a wonderful magnetic power, that was evident at once. His
sympathy for everything and everybody poured from him; he was ""big,"" big
in every way.

He chatted merrily away on a variety of topics while taking his tea.
Asking his sister for another cup, he suddenly turned to Carr. ""That
reminds me,"" he said, ""of a good story I heard yesterday. Father
Cartwright was here to lunch, he is one of the St. Clement Fathers at
the Oxford monastery. Not long ago a young nobleman--rather a _bon
vivant_, by the way--went down to spend a few days with the Fathers. He
made his arrival, very unfortunately for him, poor fellow! on a Friday,
when the fare's very frugal indeed. He had very little to eat, poor
chap, and went to bed as hungry as a hunter, quite unable to sleep he
was. Now, it's the custom for one of the Fathers to go round in the
night with a benediction, 'The Lord be with you.' They always say it in
Latin, _Dominus tecum_. The young man heard some one rapping at the
door. 'Who's there?' says he. '_Dominus tecum_,' was the answer.
'Thanks, very much,' said the nobleman, 'please put it down outside'!""

While they were laughing at the story, Lucy rose and, shaking hands
with Carr, went away.

The two clergymen were left alone. ""You'll not mind talking in here?""
Father Blantyre said. ""I've got a poor chap in me study I don't want to
disturb. I found um after lunch making a row in the street with a crowd
round him, a poor half-clothed scarecrow, beastly drunk--never saw a man
in such a state. I asked one of the crowd who he was and he said he was
a stranger, a ship's fireman, who'd been about the place for a day or
two, spending all his money in drinks, and he hadn't a friend in the
world. A policeman came along and wanted to lock um up, but I managed to
get him in here and he's sleeping it off. I shall give um egg in milk
when he comes round: his poor stomach's half poisoned with bad liquor
and no food. I always find egg and milk the best thing in these cases. I
wish he wasn't so dirty! We shall have to give 'm a hot tub before he
can go to bed.""

""What will you do with him?""

""Oh, keep him here for a day or two to pull round, give um some clothes,
and pack 'm off to sea again where he can't get any drink.""

""Don't such men ever rob you?""

""Hardly ever. It's not your real outcast who steals much. They're
generally so astonished to find a parson isn't as black as he's painted
that they don't think of anything else. They go away feeling they've got
a _pal_, made a friend! That's the awful want in their lives. A lot of
them come back, and write to me while they're away, too, queer letters
full of gratitude and bad language! But ye came to see me, my friend.
I'm so glad you've found your way here. Now, what can I do for you, or
are ye going to do anything for me?""

His manner had changed. His tone was indescribably sympathetic and
gentle. If ever the wisdom of charity and the light of holiness shone
out on a man's face, Carr thought that he saw it now.

He was entirely dominated by the man. In a burst of nervous words, he
poured out his thoughts. He told of his futile visit to Hamlyn, his keen
distress at the result, the misery the agitation gave him, and the harm
he believed it to be doing.

Blantyre listened with few words. Now and then he made a warm and
penetrating remark.

""It will pass,"" he said at length; ""God will give us peace again. He is
trying the faith of the poor and ignorant among us. Our prayers will
avail. But we will concert together that we may take such measures to
stop the local evil as we properly can. I have been loath to move in the
matter, but now that you have come to me we will join forces and take
action. There are ways and means. I hate pulling wires and using
influence, but one must sometimes. I had hoped it wouldn't be necessary.
But something must be done. Lord Huddersfield will take action for us.
The street meetings can be stopped at once. Then we can inaugurate a
real press campaign and let the leader-writers loose. Hitherto it's been
our policy to say nothing much, except in the religious papers, of
course. But the time has come when we must fight, too. I was talking to
Sir Michael Manicho about it the other day. A word or two from him and
the country will be ringing with warnings. We can rob this Luther League
of its powers in a week. It will _go on_, of course, but with its fangs
drawn. The people who support it will, many of them, cease their
subscriptions. And there is the law also. The magistrates of London are
quite ready to take a strong stand. That is settled. And a word from
the Archbishop, perhaps, would be a help. Public opinion is very easily
turned.""

He spoke calmly, but with conviction and a quiet sense of power. Carr
began to see dimly what great forces were behind this man and others of
his kind. The tremendous organising machinery of the Catholic Church was
laid bare for a moment.

A most confidential talk followed. Blantyre gave the other details and
names. He made it plain to Carr's astonished ears that those in high
places were waiting to act, waiting to see if the Church needed them.
The depth and force of it all astonished him.

A bell began to ring. ""There's evensong,"" said Blantyre, ""I must be off.
It's my turn to say it to-night.""

""I will come, too,"" Carr answered.

""Do, do! and take some food with us all afterwards, and we'll have a
longer talk. You can't think how happy I am that we have come together.
What? You've never seen our church? Why, then, you've a treat in front
of ye! Every one says it's beautiful. We all love it, we're all proud of
it!""

He took him by the arm and led him away.

Not a word of the differences that separated them, no suspicion, or
distrust, nothing but welcome and brotherhood!

The tall, bearded man and the quick, shaven Celt in his cassock went
into the church together to pray--

""Give peace in our time, O Lord.""




CHAPTER X

LOW WATER AND GREAT EXPECTATIONS


In a couple of months after the meeting between Carr and Blantyre,
public opinion had spoken in no uncertain way about the ""Luther League.""
Public opinion in these days is very easily led in this or that
direction--but only for a time. There is a vast stratum of common-sense,
of love of justice, of wholesome sanity, in England, and it can always
be reached by a little boring. In the end, especially upon any question
which is in its essence sociological, a proper balance is found and the
truth of a matter firmly established.

And Hamlyn's agitation was treated as a social question rather than a
religious one, at any rate by a secular press. Whether the doings of the
High Church party were legal or illegal according to the prayer-book
(such was the line the papers took) was a question to be decided by
experts in history and the authorities of the Church; a question, in
fact, that ought to be decided in a legitimate way. What was, however,
quite certain, was that the proceedings of Hamlyn and his party were
improper, vulgar, and indecent. It was simply misleading nonsense to
cover the Ritualistic party, a body of high-minded and earnest men, with
the noisy and venomous vituperation of the streets. Freedom of thought
was the heritage of every Englishman, and Hamlyn had simply elected
himself a grand inquisitor of matters that did not concern him and which
he was unable to understand. No dishonesty on the man's part was
alleged. But his history was unearthed by one or two enterprising
journalists, following the popular lead. It was shown that while nothing
had ever been said against his personal character--and nothing was said
now--he had risen from the position of a struggling local newspaper man
to comparative affluence and the control of a large and costly
organisation. The cash accounts of the League were scrutinised, and
unkind remarks were made upon the constant advertisements of the League,
with their cry for increased income and fresh subscribers. It was
pointed out that people who supported a crusade made without authority
by a self-constituted Peter the Hermit, over whom no proper control
could be exercised and whose methods of prosecuting it were a mixture of
buffoonery, uncharitable malice, and untruth, were incurring a serious
responsibility.

In short, public opinion was told in plain language exactly how it ought
to regard the campaign. Great newspapers spoke out during one fortnight
with singular unanimity. Street meetings were promptly broken up by the
police, and after some of the Luther Lecturers had been to prison,
finding that public interest in their ""martyrdom"" was languishing, they
subsided into quiet, devotional meetings on the sands at popular
watering-places. Whenever Mr. Hamlyn hired a hall and lectured on the
iniquities of the local clergy, he was confronted by the spectacle of a
sharp-faced man who took down every word of his utterances with
scrupulous fidelity. It was always the same machine-like man, in
Liverpool or in Plymouth, in Bath or Dundee--there he was. The
agitator's eloquence was considerably checked. He was in no condition to
sustain an action for slander or libel in which, he well knew, some poor
clergyman would somehow be able to brief all the great hawk-faced
leaders of the bar, gentlemen with whom Mr. Hamlyn wished to have as
little as possible to do.

At such open-air meetings as were permitted, some unobtrusive stranger
was generally to be found distributing leaflets among the crowd, which
resembled nothing so much as the literature of the Luther League itself
in its general ""get-up"" and appearance. On perusal, however, it proved
to be of quite a different tenor, being nothing else than extracts from
the best-known English newspapers on Mr. Hamlyn and his mission. This
was very trying and disturbed the harmony of many meetings.

In the assemblies convened at halls hired for the occasion,--admission
by ticket only,--it frequently happened that some well-known local
resident, who could not be denied, made his appearance, and with a few
weighty words entirely changed the character of the meeting. The reports
from his myrmidons all over the country, which reached Mr. Hamlyn in the
Strand, showed a series of counter-moves which alarmed him in their
neatness and ingenuity.

It had been for months a pleasing habit of the peripatetic Protestants
under the Hamlyn banner to visit churches and make notes of the
ornaments therein, afterwards lecturing on them in their own inimitable
and humorous manner to crowds in back streets.

Mr. Moffatt, indeed--the young gentleman who had forsaken the plumbing
and gas-fitting industry to become incandescent and watery on the
Protestant war-path--had more than once broken a small crucifix with an
umbrella. The lecturers found, however, that, as if by some concerted
action, church doors were locked wherever they might go. The poor
fellows' hunger for the sight of candlesticks and sanctuary lamps was
hardly ever gratified now, and they were compelled to the somewhat
ignominious expedient of nailing the bulls of Mr. Hamlyn to the doors of
sacred buildings and going gloomily away.

On one occasion, Mr. Moffatt, who was a young fellow of considerable
hardihood, arrived at a well-known sink of ritual during the week, where
the incense used in church cost, it was reported, as much as _eight
shillings a pound_! Failing in every effort to penetrate the building,
one Sunday morning he mingled with a group of worshippers and made an
attempt to enter the church. Being a somewhat tubby youth of no great
height, he followed closely on the footsteps of a ponderous gentleman
quite six feet high, and congratulated himself he was escaping
observation, just as one has seen a small dog slink nearer and nearer to
the tempting joint upon the dinner-table. His hopes were doomed to
failure. He was almost inside the porch when two stalwart church wardens
barred the way and read him a paper, which stated that, as he was a
known brawler who had been convicted of other illegal disturbances in
God's house, entry was refused him.

At the moment, in his chagrin and surprise, Mr. Moffatt could think of
no better retort than an injunction to the reader of the document to
""keep his hair on."" Then, gathering his faculties together, he commenced
a vigorous protest as to his rights as a ""baptized, confirmed
communicant member of the Church of England"" to make one of the
congregation. No answer whatever was vouchsafed him, and he was
compelled to stand meekly by while the usual members of the congregation
were admitted.

He bethought himself of an appeal to the majesty of the law! ""Very well,
then,"" he said, ""I shall go and fetch a policeman. That's all.""

One of the church wardens opened the inner door of the church and
beckoned to some one. A sergeant of police, in his uniform, emerged
quietly. Mr. Moffatt started, muttered something about ""writing to the
Bishop,"" and left the vicinity of the church without further ado.

And it was thus all over the country. Hamlyn and his son realised that a
strong and powerful organisation was arrayed against them. Their tactics
were counter-checked at every turn.

As a natural consequence of all this, the subscriptions to the League
fell away at a most alarming rate. The street and public hall
collections of the lecturers dwindled until they could hardly pay
themselves their own modest emoluments. The general subscriptions and
special donations to the head office were in a no less unsatisfactory
condition.

A very great number of people, with an honest dislike and distrust of
practices which seemed to them against the law of the Church of England
(as they understood it), had hitherto sent Hamlyn considerable sums of
money. His campaign seemed to them a real and efficacious method of
dealing with the question, and his methods had not been very clear to
them in their actual detail.

But when the most influential part of the press began to speak with no
uncertain voice, these people began to hurriedly repudiate any
connection with the Luther League and to tie their purse-strings in a
very tight knot indeed. Then, again, there was a second not
inconsiderable class of people whose support was withdrawn. These were
more or less of the Miss Pritchett order. They had some real or fancied
grievance against the vicar of the parish in which they lived, and the
machinery of Hamlyn's League was found to be at their service for the
purposes of revenge. Under the cover of religious truth they were able
to gratify a private spite--a method of campaign as old as history
itself. The aims of these people had been achieved. That is to say, Mr.
Hamlyn or his friends had made themselves more or less a thorn in the
sides of the local clergy, had ""banged the field-piece, twanged the
lyre,"" and departed with as much money as they were able to collect in
the cause of Protestant Truth.

And those people who had first moved in the matter saw that, after all,
the _status ante quo_ had not been altered in the least, that nothing
had happened at all! One or two people of no importance whatever might
have left the Church, but the general result was, as a rule, an
increase of the attacked congregation and, inevitably, an enormous
increase of personal popularity of the priest and of loyalty to him and
his teachings.

So this second class of worthies also became hard-hearted to the
perfervid advertisements of the League, buttoned up their pockets, and
tried to behave as though the names of those twin greatnesses, Martin
Luther and Samuel Hamlyn, had never crossed their lips.

In the offices in the Strand, all these causes were thoroughly
appreciated and understood. The prosperity, or rather the consciousness
of it, which had seemed to ooze from Mr. Hamlyn's features, was no more
to be seen. The countenance of the Protestant Pope wore an anxious and
harassed expression when he was alone with his son, and their talks
together were frequent and of long duration.

One disastrous morning the post brought nothing in the way of fuel for
the Protestant fire except a single miserable little post-office order
for seven shillings and sixpence, a donation from ""A Baptist Friend.""

Protestant Truth was in a bad way. Both the Hamlyns thought so as they
sat down gloomily for a private conference in the inner room.

""There's a good balance in the bank, of course,"" Hamlyn said. ""We've got
staying power for some time yet, and the salaries are safe. But it's the
future we've got to look to. The righteous cause can't go on nothing.""

""Don't you worry, Father,"" said Sam, ""that Exeter Hall speaking has
pulled you down a bit. You're not your real self. I haven't a doubt that
you'll think of something to wake things up in a day or two.""

""Hope so, I'm sure, though I can't think of anything at present. But
seven and six! It's the first day Protestantism's dropped below a matter
of two pound odd.""

""There's plenty of other posts during the day, Pa.""

""That's true. One day or three days don't matter. But it shows how
things are going. The Romans have been too cunning for us, Sam. The
wiles of the Scarlet Woman are prevailing; honest, straightforward
Protestants are being undermined.""

""But think of the letters of sympathy we've 'ad since the great
Ritualistic conspiracy has come up. The real hearty Protestants are as
faithful as they ever were.""

""Yes, they are,"" said Mr. Hamlyn reflectively; ""we can always fall back
on them, and we've got some thousands of names and addresses on the
books. The League'll _go on_ safe enough, there'll always be labourers
in the vineyard and them as will pay the overseer his just dues. But
it's 'ard, after the splendid success we've had, to sink down into a
small commonplace affair with just a bare living. The real red-hot
Protestants, who are really _afraid_ of Rome and that, are so few! These
disgusting newspapers been showing up everything and the lukewarm people
have been falling away. All the real money is flowing back into Roman
channels. If there were more really earnest Protestants we might keep on
as good as ever. But there's not. We haven't sold a gross of _Bloody
Marys_ during the month. It's a pity we had to suppress the
_Confessional_; that was a real seller--and did a lot of good,"" Mr.
Hamlyn added as an afterthought.

""We couldn't well do no other after the 'int we got from the _Vigilance_
people,"" said Sam.

""I suppose not. But it was a great pity.""

""You're due at Malakoff House to-night, aren't you, Pa?""

""Yes, at seven. I'm very uneasy in my mind about Miss P., Sam.""

""Gussie says she's worse than she knows herself. She hasn't been out of
bed for a fortnight now.""

""She's not long for this world, I'm afraid,"" Hamlyn answered. ""While
she's alive we are fairly safe. But when she's in Glory where shall we
be?""

""That's the question, Father. Gussie knows nothing and can't find out
anything, neither. A really handsome legacy invested in some good stock
would put us right again whatever might happen.""

""It would. But just at present the old lady's awful to deal with. You
see, I'm in an awkward position, Sam. I'm not such a fool as to tell her
how we've been bested lately--that's to say, I can't bring myself to
wound a faithful Protestant heart by stories of persecution of them as
is doing the Lord's work against Rome. Miss P. don't know anything about
the checks we've received of late. Well, then, she's always bothering me
to know why we aren't keeping it up in Hornham, why we aren't going for
Blantyre and that lot. She hears everything that goes on in the parish,
though Gussie Davies does her best to stop it. But she don't seem to
trust Gussie as she did, which is a pity. Miss P. quite sees that, for
some reason or other, things have gone quiet in the parish, and she's
getting restive. Something must be done soon, that's quite evident. Some
big thing to wake her up--and everyone else, too.""

""It doesn't matter much how far we go now.""

""Not a bit. The further the better, as a matter of fact. The lecturers'
hands are so tied now, what with all these cunning moves of the
Romanists, that _they_ can't do anything. It seems we've alienated all
the moderate people and we've only the extreme ones to rely on. Well,
then, we must wake _them_ up, that's all. The papers can't well say
worse of us than they do already, so it really is the best policy to
give the whole country a regular startler. I can't think of anything new
at present, but I shall. I expect a bit of inspiration'll come before
long. Anyway, I shall tell Miss Pritchett to-night to wait and have
patience a little longer, as there's something in the wind that will do
all she wants. It's her illness. She _must_ have continual bits of
excitement to keep her going, it's a regular disease with her now. If I
can think of a good scheme to liven up things generally, in the first
flush of it she'll be so pleased that we might venture a word or two
upon her testamentary dispositions. I should feel so much happier about
the Cause if I knew the League was down in her will for a thumping sum.
Of course, anything of the sort would have to be said most careful.
She'd get up and be healthy again in a week if she thought we thought
she was going to peg out!""

Mr. Hamlyn concluded his remarks with a somewhat resentful sigh, and,
whistling down the speaking-tube for the correspondence clerk, began to
dictate his morning's letters.

It was about seven o'clock when the secretary arrived at Malakoff House,
tired and dispirited. The whole day had gone unsatisfactorily. An
evening paper had come out with a leaded column about the League which
was far from complimentary. The various callers at the office were all
more or less disagreeable, and even the volatile Samuel had been plunged
into a state of furtive gloom that radiated mis-ease upon all who came
near him.

Mr. Hamlyn was shown into the drawing-room and in a minute or two,
Gussie Davies came to him. The girl was white and tired of feature.
Dark semicircles were under her eyes, but her manner had a nervous
excitement that was infectious.

Both of them spoke in that agitated whisper that some people affect in
the neighbourhood of those who are seriously ill and whom they think
like to die. It is a whisper in which there is a not unpleasurable note,
a self-congratulation at being near to the Great Mystery, as spectators
merely.

""How is she?"" whispered Hamlyn.

""Bad,"" answered Gussie. ""Dr. Hibbert's been and I had a chat with him
afterwards. He daren't speak as plain as he'd like, for fear of
frightening her. But he says she must _not_ keep on exciting herself. It
will be fatal if she does. Another two months of this St. Elwyn's
excitement will kill her, Mr. Hamlyn. I'm sure of that.""

""What's she been saying?""

""Oh, the same old thing: Why doesn't Mr. Hamlyn do something decisive?
Why doesn't he strike these proud priests some crushing blow? You know
she's heard that Miss Blantyre has come to live at the vicarage, and
that makes her keener than ever.""

""Well, I must think of something, that's all,"" said the secretary in a
decisive whisper. ""I'll promise her a new move almost at once. I
suppose you've had no chance to get in a word about the will?""

""Not a chance. I can't find out anything either. All I know is that her
solicitor hasn't been here since she joined the League. So that looks as
if there isn't anything done _yet_.""

""I don't suppose there is, my dear. But if I can keep her quiet _now_,
and do something big in the parish in a few days, then I suppose we
might broach it?""

""Certainly, Mr. Hamlyn, I should say so.""

""Good. One more question, Gussie, before I go up. Do you think it wise
to mention a contribution to the working fund just now? One can never be
too zealous in the cause of Protestant Truth, but I want to deal wisely
with her.""

""Oh, I think you'll be safe enough for a hundred or two,"" Gussie said,
""as long as you promise her a good rumpus soon! She ain't mean, I will
say that for her.""

Mr. Hamlyn nodded in a brisk, business-like way, rang for the maid, and
was shown up to the sick-room.

Gussie remained in the drawing-room. She wondered how successful her
friend and lover's father would be. She had immense faith in his
abilities and already looked forward to the time when, released for ever
from her duties at Malakoff House, she would, as Mrs. Hamlyn, Junior,
become a leading lady of True Protestantism. Not that the girl hated her
employer. She had no affection for Miss Pritchett--and it would have
been wonderful if she had--but her feeling was not stronger than that.
As for the money question, the money that the rich old lady was giving
to the Luther League, Gussie saw no harm in that. The money was for a
good cause, so she believed, and the Hamlyns, _père et fils_, had much
better have the handling of it than any one else!

Mr. Hamlyn was a considerable time. The girl wandered about the room,
agog to hear his news, thinking with a certain terror of the grim old
woman up-stairs. For what had been tartness and acerbity had become
grimness now, in the pompous old-fashioned bed-chamber, where she lay
waiting the beating of those great black wings which all, save she, knew
were drawing near.

Although Gussie Davis knew all the foibles of her mistress and could
play upon them with adroitness and success, she felt, nevertheless, a
fear of the old woman. Miss Pritchett, with all her absurdities, her
petty jealousies, her greed for flattery, was a woman with a
personality. She was very rich, and she had chosen to remain among the
surroundings of her youth and be great among the small. Yet even a petty
supremacy awes the petty, and the sly Welsh girl was indubitably awed.
She was not wholly bad, not unfeeling in her way, but she was weak. In
the hands of the Hamlyns, she had been as putty from the very first.
They were strong men. There was no doubt about that. With all the
temperamental vulgarity and greed of both father and son, there was
indubitable strength--and, in the case of the elder, considerable
magnetic power.

They had been kind to her also. She was genuinely fond of Sam, and he
was fond of her. The accident of her position, that she was able to help
and forward their plans, made no difference as to that. Hamlyn, Senior,
liked her. He would, she knew, be kind and fatherly to her when she was
married to Sam. He was that now.

For, if Hamlyn had been able to employ his cleverness to good advantage
in the exploitation of any other thing save of religion, he would have
been counted as a shrewd business man and nothing more. Nothing worse
than that at any rate. He had no personal vices. He did not in the least
realise that he was living a life that was shameful. Religion meant no
more to him than any other way of making money would have meant. That
was all. And, oddly enough, Blantyre himself shrewdly suspected this,
while Carr looked upon the agitator as infamous.

Hamlyn was perfectly aware that he was a humbug, but he thought that his
humbug was perfectly legitimate in the war of life.

The priest at St. Elwyn's whom he had so bitterly attacked and wounded
was a psychologist. Most priests are. Men who sit in churches and hear
the true story of men's lives learn an infinite tenderness. Men come to
them for comfort, to hear the comfortable words that our Lord has spoken
for the sinful who are penitent, to receive from them that absolution
which is nothing more than the confirmation, in a concrete and certain
way, of the promise of God. It is only the people who have never
confessed their sins, not to a priest, but to God through a priest, who
speak against the Sacrament of Penance.

They do not know they are tilting at windmills. And the bitter shame
that sometimes comes to a man as he tells another man the true story of
his life is in itself the truest evidence that he means to amend it. No
one would do that without penitence. There is a motive for every action;
the motive would be wanting if confession were made without a resolve to
lead a new life. If those who fulminate against the Church's method, and
sneer at the members of the Church who follow it, as dupes and fools,
could understand that it is discipline that purifies and exalts, they
would sneer no longer. It is all very well to be a _franc-tireur_, no
doubt. But it is better to be a member of the regular forces. It is not
so jolly for a time, perhaps, but in event of capture, the former is
shot at sight, the latter becomes a prisoner of war with all the rights
and traditions of his lot.

Simile was one of Mr. Hamlyn's pet weapons, but in his noisy syllogisms,
he left out the first two premises and confined himself to the
conclusion--generally an emphatic epithet.

Mr. Hamlyn came down-stairs at last. His face was grave, but peaceful.
Perspiration showed upon it. He had been having a hard time.

""I say, my dear,"" he whispered, ""I wonder if you've got a cup of tea
handy. I've had a thick time!""

It is better to take the stimulant of tea than the more usual brandy and
soda. Hamlyn was a strong teetotaller, and that counted to his credit at
a moment like this. For the man had obviously been through an unnerving
experience. He was not his ready and impudent self.

The tea was brought. It revived him.

""Well!"" he said in a low voice, ""I don't want to go through many scenes
like that again, Gussie! She's getting worse and worse. Her brain can't
last much longer if she goes on like this! However, I managed to calm
her down. She's going off to sleep now. I told her I'd wake Hornham up
in a few days--and I'll _have_ to do it, what's more!""

""Did you get a cheque?"" said the practical Gussie.

""Yes,"" said Mr. Hamlyn in a slightly more relieved voice. ""She gave me a
couple of hundred in the end. At heart, she's devoted to the cause of
Protestant Truth. But she's getting horribly restive, my dear. I'm sorry
for her. She's a wreck of what she used to be--but she's a wreck that
wants a lot of salvage!""

The colour came back into the plump, clean-shaven face as the tea did
its work.

""I forgot, my dear,"" he said; ""I brought you a box of chocolates. It
clean went out of my 'ead,"" he waved an exhausted hand towards his small
brown leather bag, which stood on the table between a plaster model of
the leaning tower of Pisa and a massive volume entitled _Every Young
Lady's Vade Mecum_.

Gussie smiled her thanks and opened the bag, while Mr. Hamlyn poured out
another cup of tea.

Gussie felt in the bag. It was full of papers, but there were two
parcels there. She took them out. They were of much the same size. Each
was neatly tied up in white paper.

She pulled the string from one of them. A number of thin
semi-transparent white wafers fell out upon the table.

""Oh, I'm sorry!"" she cried, ""I thought this was the box of chocolates.""

Hamlyn looked up wearily. To his immeasurable surprise, he saw that the
girl's face had grown very pale. She shrunk away from the table.

""What's the matter, my dear?"" he said, thoroughly alarmed.

She suddenly flushed a deep scarlet.

""What are these?"" she said, pointing with a shaking finger to the things
on the table.

""Them?"" said Mr. Hamlyn in cheerful surprise. ""Mass wafers, my dear. I
buy them in a shop in Covent Garden. We distribute them among the Luther
Lecturers, for object lessons to the poor deluded Ritualists.""

The girl had crouched to the wall of the room. Hamlyn was seriously
alarmed. Her face was almost purple, her eyes started out of her head.

""They're not con--_consecrated_?"" she gasped.

Hamlyn could not understand her emotion. ""No,"" he said; ""why, Gussie,
what a superstitious little thing you are. And if they were, what then?""
Frank amazement showed on his face.

""Oh, nothing, Mr. Hamlyn,"" the girl said at length, becoming more normal
in her manner.

In a few minutes, Hamlyn left the house, leaving the girl in her
ordinary manner, eating the chocolates that he had brought her.

His able mind was busily at work. He knew that during Miss Pritchett's
adhesion to St. Elwyn's Gussie had, perforce, been one of the
congregation there and had been taught and trained by the clergy.

""No wonder,"" he thought bitterly to himself; ""no wonder that they can
win along the line, when they can sow seeds like that in a girl's mind.
Why, she's a thorough little Protestant at heart. To think that those
things should have startled her so! It's a lingering prejudice, I
suppose. They _are_ a queer lot--the Romanists!""

As he communed thus with himself, a swift thought came to him. At the
moment of its arrival in his brain, he almost staggered. Then, pulling
himself together, he walked rapidly to his own house.

He thought he saw his way to a _coup_ that would make all his previous
efforts as nothing. How wonderfully simple it was! Why had he never
thought of it before--_what_ a fool he had been! Here was the solution
of all the difficulties he was in. The answer seemed to have come to his
conversation with Samuel in the morning.

He went to his study and fortunately found that Sam was already there.
Miss Maud Hamlyn sat in the room also, but when she saw her father's
face, she left the room at once. It wore the ""business look"" she knew
well, and, though she but dimly understood what her brother and father
were engaged in, she knew it had brought great prosperity and honour to
all of them, and was loath to intrude upon any profitable confabulation.

""Have you got it, Pa?"" said Samuel, eagerly.

""Yes, I _'ave_,"" answered the secretary, ""and very fine it is too!""

""How much?"" asked Sam.

""What do you mean?""

""The cheque, Miss Pritchett's latest.""

""Oh, _that_,"" said Hamlyn. ""Two hundred, what we expected. I meant
something else. I've got the new scheme to wake things up! The best
thing we've done yet, my boy!""

Sam rubbed his hands. ""What did I say this morning? I knew you'd do it,
Pa. Well, let's have it.""

Mr. Hamlyn sat back in his chair, willing to dally a moment with his
triumph and enjoy the full savour of it.

""Why we never thought of it before,"" he said, ""beats me entirely!
Something suggested it to me to-night, and I've been wondering at our
neglecting such a move.""

""What _is_ it then?""

""What about one of us going to the Mass and bringing away the
consecrated wafer? Then a big public meeting's called and I _show_ the
people what we've got! The 'flour-and-water god' of the Romanists! Not
the usual plan of producing a wafer we've bought from a shop, but the
_real thing_, Sam! Then they'll all be able to see that there's no
difference between before and after! It'll explode the whole thing and
give the League an advertisement better than anything that's gone
before!""

Sam looked very grave indeed. ""It's a little bit _too_ much, I'm afraid,
Father,"" he said.

""What do you mean, my son?"" answered the secretary in extreme and real
surprise.

""Well, I don't know,"" Sam said doubtfully, ""but I shouldn't like to
meddle with it myself.""

Mr. Hamlyn leaned forward. ""Sam,"" he said, ""you're a fool. You're as bad
as Gussie Davies! Leave the matter to me. Who's awakened Protestantism
in Hengland? ME! Who knows how to work a popular cause? ME! Who's going
to boom the Luther League up to the top again? ME!""

""Have it your own way, Father,"" Sam said, ""you generally do come out on
top.""

""Ring the bell for some tea,"" said Mr. Hamlyn, ""and let's talk out the
details. We'll 'ave to get it where we aren't known by sight.""




CHAPTER XI

THE NEWS THAT CARR BROUGHT


As the days wore on, and Lucy Blantyre became accustomed to her
surroundings, she found that she was in thorough tune with them. During
the year she had been away from St. Elwyn's, she had spent most of the
time abroad, at first with Lady Linquest, afterwards with friends. The
old life of fashionable people and ""smart"" doings palled horribly.
Travelling was a diversion from that, and, in some sense, a preparation
for the more useful life that she determined to live in the future.

She had quite made up her mind to that. Nothing would induce her to go
back to live in Park Lane once more. Life offered far more than the West
End of London could offer; so much was plain. She kept up a regular
correspondence with her brother and was fully informed of all that took
place in Hornham. Her thoughts turned more and more affectionately
towards the dingy old house, centre of such ceaseless activities, the
old house with the great church watching over it.

Down there it seemed as if provision was made for all one's needs of the
mind. Stress and storm beat upon it in vain, and it combined the joys of
both the cloister and the hearth.

In her limited experience, there had been nothing like it. A year or two
ago, she would have smiled incredulously if any one had told her that
she would like going to church twice or three times on a week-day. But
during her stay at St. Elwyn's how natural and helpful it had seemed,
how much a part of the proper order of things. The morning Eucharist
while day in the outside world was beginning, the stately and beautiful
evensong as men ceased their toil, these coloured all the day, were
woven into its warp and woof. She knew that the _abnormal_ life was the
life of the majority, the life of those who lived in a purely secular
way, who never worshipped or prayed.

When any mind, in its settling of its attitude towards the Unseen, gets
as far as this; when it realises that, despite the laughter of fools and
the indifference of most people, the _logical_ use of life is to make
it in constant touch with God, then, as a rule, the personal religious
conviction will come in due time. It had not come to Lucy yet in full
and satisfying measure, it had not come even when she determined to make
her home with her brother for a time and help in any way she could.

During the year of travel, she was also in regular communication with
James Poyntz. Insensibly his letters to her had become the letters of a
lover. He told her all his thoughts and the details of his work and
hopes, and, mingling with what were in fact a series of brilliant
personal confessions, there began to be a high note of personal devotion
to her. One does not need the simple alphabet of lover's words to write
love letters. Poyntz used no terms of endearment, and as yet had made
her no definite proposal of marriage. But the girl knew, quite
certainly, exactly how he felt towards her. There was no disguise in his
letters, and the time was drawing near when he would definitely ask her
to share his life.

She had not yet definitely summed up her attitude towards him. She was
at the crossing of the roads; new influences, new ideas were pouring
into her brain from every side. It was necessary to readjust herself to
life completely before she could settle upon any course.

She knew that to be Lady Huddersfield was to take a high seat in Vanity
Fair. The Huddersfields belonged to the old order of society, to that
inner circle of the great who never open their door indiscriminately to
the Jew and the mining millionaire. People laughed at them and called
them pompous and dull, but there was a high serenity among them
nevertheless. She might have married half a dozen times had she so
chosen. Her income was large enough to make her a small heiress, at any
rate to be an appreciable factor in the case, besides which her birth
was unexceptionable. It was known that when Lady Linquest fluttered away
to another world, the old lady's money would come to her niece. But
position merely, rank rather, did not attract a girl who already went
wherever she chose. And among the men in society who had offered her
marriage, or were prepared to do so, she found no one capable of
satisfying her brain. Poyntz did this. She found power in him, strength,
purpose. She knew that, in whatever station of life he was, the man was
finely tempered, high in that aristocracy of intellect which some people
say is the only aristocracy there is.

She was conscious of all this, but, especially since she had been
settled in the vicarage as a home, she was becoming conscious of many
other influences at work upon her. Religion, the personal giving of
one's self to God, was tinging all her life and actions now. Hour by
hour, she found herself drawing nearer to the Cross. Her progress had
become a matter of practical experience. It was impossible to live with
the people she was among, to watch every detail of their lives, to find
_exactly where the motive power and the sustaining power came from_,
without casting in her lot with them in greater or less degree. Every
day she found some hold upon the outside world was loosened, something
she had imagined had great value in her eyes suddenly seemed quite
worthless! Looked at in the light that was beginning to shine upon her,
she was frequently surprised beyond measure to find how worthless most
things were! Her brain was keen, cool, and logical. Hitherto she had
refused to draw an inference--no proof, by the way, of any want of
logical skill;--now she was drawing it.

She was great and intimate friends with the two assistant priests,
Stephens and King. Stephens was engaged to a girl in the country, King
belonged to some confraternity of celibates. Both were high-minded men,
who appreciated to the full the charm of cultured feminine society and
found her drawing-room a most pleasant oasis now and then. And every one
at the clergy-house began to see a great deal of Mr. Carr. The lonely
man found companionship and sympathy there. He found intellectual men,
university men like himself, with whom he could talk. He had been
intellectually starving in Hornham, and good brains rust unless they
have some measure of intercourse with their kind.

He was constantly with his new friends. One Sunday Father Blantyre
preached at St. Luke's. The church was crowded, to hear a man whom a
great many there believed capable of almost any form of casuistry and
sly dealing. But when the little Irishman got into the pulpit he gave
them a simple, forcible discourse on some points of conduct, delivered
with all his personal charm, his native raciness and wit; many wagging
tongues were silenced in the parish. Carr's experiment was a bold one,
but it succeeded. An ounce of fact is worth a pound of hearsay.
Blantyre was so transparently honest, so obviously incapable of any of
the things imputed to him by the Luther Leaguers, that the most
prejudiced folk at St. Luke's said no more than that it was a pity such
a decent fellow, who could preach such a good sermon, wasted so much of
his time over unnecessary fads!

For some reason or other,--she could not quite explain it to
herself,--Lucy looked on Carr with different eyes from those with which
she viewed Stephens or King. He seemed less set apart from the ordinary
lot of men than they were. His ordinary clerical costume may have had
something to do with it, the contrast between his clothes and those of
the laymen not being so marked as in the case of the High Church clergy.
And his manner also was different in a subtle way. Lucy liked the manner
of King and she liked the manner of Carr, but they were markedly unlike
each other. The former spoke of everything from the Church's point of
view, the latter more from the point of view of an ordinary layman who
loves and serves our Lord.

Lucy had no fault to find with the ecclesiastical attitude. She had long
before realised what were the spiritual results of rebellion and
schism; they were too patent in Hornham. She was definitely Catholic.
Therefore she approved of King as a priest and liked him as a man. But
Carr seemed to be more upon her own level, not set apart in any way. She
knew he was just as much a priest as the other, but he came into her
consciousness from a purely human standpoint, while the other did not.

Viewing him thus, she had come to find she liked him very much indeed.
He was a very ""manly"" man, she found, with a virile intellect which had
had too little play of late years. She came to know of his life and
found it as full of good works as her brother's. The methods differed,
the Church and its services took an altogether secondary place in these
ministrations; the charities of a poor man were necessarily more
circumscribed than those of his rich neighbour, but the spiritual
fervour was as great.

Lucy could not help wondering why a man who had such abundant means to
his hand of holding and influencing his people used so few of them. Why
was his church not beautiful? How did he exist spiritually without the
sacramental grace so abundantly vouchsafed at St. Elwyn's?

She had a glimpse deep down into the man once. One evening at St.
Elwyn's, when Carr had come to supper, the conversation turned upon a
rather serious epidemic of typhoid fever that had only just been
overcome in Hornham and which had caused a widespread distress among the
poorer classes.

""I'm getting up a fund,"" Father Blantyre said, ""to relieve some of the
worst cases and to send as many as possible of the convalescents off to
the seaside. Now, Lucy, my dear, what will you stump up? This girl's
rolling in money, Carr! She's more than she knows what to do with!""

Lucy noticed--no one else did--that Mr. Carr flushed a little and
started as Blantyre finished speaking.

She turned to her brother. ""I'll give you a hundred pounds, dear,"" she
said.

""Good girl!"" he shouted in high good humour.

Lucy turned to Carr. ""I suppose you've a great many destitute cases in
St. Luke's?"" she asked.

""Very many, I'm sorry to say,"" he answered sadly. ""I've done what I
could, but I've hardly any money myself until next quarter-day, and our
people are nearly all of them poor."" He thought with gentle envy of
these wealthy folk who were able to do so much, while he, alas! could do
so little.

""I'll subscribe something to St. Luke's, too,"" Lucy said. ""I'll give you
the same, Mr. Carr. I'll write you a cheque after supper.""

""That's a sportswoman!"" said Father Blantyre; ""good for you, Lucy!""

Carr flushed up. The destitution in his parish had been a constant grief
to him during the last few weeks. He had not known where to turn to
relieve it. He had prayed constantly that help might be forthcoming. He
broke out into a nervous torrent of thanks which came from his very
heart, becoming eloquent as he went on and revealing, unconsciously
enough, much of his inward self to them. They were all touched and
charmed by the man's simplicity and earnestness. He showed a great love
for the poor as he talked. Sympathy for suffering and kindness towards
it are not rare things in England. We are a charitable folk, take us in
the mass. But this quality of personal love for the outcast and
down-trodden is not so often met with. It is a talent, and Carr
possessed it in a high degree.

A step in their intimacy was marked that night; all felt drawn more
closely to the Evangelical vicar. He stood alone; his life seemed
cheerless to them all and their sympathy was his--though he had never
made the least parade of his troubles. Moreover, the three clergy of St.
Elwyn's were beginning to find out, with pleased surprise, how near he
was to them in the great essentials, how Catholic his views were.
Already much of Carr's dislike to the ceremonial of St. Elwyn's was
fading away. He had witnessed it, found that there was absolutely no
harm in it, that it did _not_ stand between the soul and God, but even
sometimes assisted in the journey upwards. He did not endorse it as yet,
he did not contemplate anything of the sort for himself or his people,
but he saw the good there and found nothing to disgust or harm.

Later on that evening, Dr. Hibbert came in, and there was music. Lucy
played and sang to them, and Carr, who had a fine baritone, sang an old
favourite or two, college songs, _Gaudeamus Igitur_, _John Peel_, and
the like.

Then, while the four other men took a hand at whist--if only Mr. Hamlyn
could have seen the ""devil's picture books"" upon the table!--Carr had a
long, quiet talk with Lucy Blantyre. He found himself telling her much
of his work and hopes, of his early life in a bleak Northumberland
vicarage, of Cambridge, and the joyous days when he rowed three in the
King's boat and all the skies were fair.

Now and then, when he would have withdrawn into himself again, fearing
that he was boring her, she encouraged him to go on. With her cheque in
his pocket, he went home in a glow that night. He thought constantly of
her, and when he went to bed, he looked curiously in the mirror, turning
away from it with a sigh, a shake of the head, and the chilling memory
that the girl was rich, allied to great families, a personage in London
society, and that a poor gentleman toiling in Hornham could never be a
mate for such as she was.

Three or four days after the incident of the subscription, Lucy received
a letter from Agatha Poyntz, who was staying with the St. Justs in
Berkeley Square. The letter begged Lucy to ""come up to town"" for an
afternoon. A theatre party had been formed, which was to consist of
Agatha herself, Lady Lelant, a young married cousin of hers, and James
Poyntz. Lucy was begged to come and complete the party. They were to go
to tea afterwards at the Savoy or somewhere, and Lucy could drive home
in the evening. The letter was quite imperative in its demand for Lucy's
presence, and the girl had a shrewd suspicion who it was that had
inspired it. Her last few letters from Poyntz had been almost, so she
fancied, leading up to just some such occasion as this which was now
proposed.

She thought it all over during the morning of that day. Her mind
wavered. A few weeks ago she knew that she would not have hesitated for
a moment. Whatever her answer might eventually be to what James Poyntz
had to say, she would have gone to the tryst and listened to him. To
hear him pleading, to see this scion of an ancient and honourable house,
this big-brained man, pleading for her, would be sweet. Every woman
would feel that. But now she hesitated very much. She hardly owned it to
herself, but a very different figure was coming to have a continual
place in her thoughts. A graver figure, a less complex figure, and one
invested with a dignity that was not of this world, a dignity that the
peer's son had not.

For now, most indubitably, a new element was coming into her life, one
that had not been there before.

And there was yet another cause for her hesitation. She had come to see
that the supremely important thing in life was religion; she knew that
it was going to be so for her. She wasn't bigoted, she realised the
blameless life that many people who did not believe in our Lord appeared
to live. But that was not the point. Works were good, they were a
necessary concomitant of any life that was to be bound up with hers. But
faith was a paramount necessity also. She had no illusions about James
Poyntz. She did not think, as less keen-sighted girls have thought of
atheist lovers, that she could ever bring him to the Faith. She knew
quite well that it would be impossible, that he was one of those folk to
whom the ""talent"" of faith does not seem to have been given, and who
will have to begin all over again in the next world, learning the truths
of Christianity like children.

While she was thinking out the question of acceptance or refusal, her
eye caught a date on her tablets. It was the date of the theatre party
and also of a meeting to be held during the afternoon in the public
hall at Hornham, at which Father Blantyre had consented to hold public
argument upon the legalities of ritual and the truth of Catholic dogma
with some of the Luther Lecturers.

Hamlyn had intended that this meeting should take place in the evening,
for two reasons. In the first place, during the afternoon he was himself
to address a great meeting in London, to which all the ""red-hot
Protestants"" on the lists of the League had been specially invited by
ticket, and at which a great sensation was hinted at, in much the same
way as music-hall managers announce the forthcoming appearance of some
entirely new spectacle, trick, or performer.

Mr. Hamlyn had hoped to arrive in Hornham from the Strand flushed with a
great victory, the news of which would have preceded him during the
afternoon.

Moreover, in the evening an audience would assemble with which the
Luther Lecturers would be thoroughly at home--Mr. Sam Hamlyn would have
seen to that--and the place would be packed by rowdy non-churchgoers who
would come with the intention of witnessing a row, even if they
themselves had to create it. Thus a ""great Protestant demonstration of
North London"" would be absolutely assured.

Unfortunately, Mr. Hamlyn received the plainest of plain hints from the
local chief of police that he would get himself into particularly hot
water if he proceeded with his little scheme, and that the words of one
of his men--the ingenuous Mr. Moffatt indeed, who, locked out of every
church in England, had lately returned to his parental roof for a
holiday--to a certain rough section of the community, in connection with
this very meeting, would be brought up against him.

The police had no objection to a meeting during the afternoon. The
dangerous element would still be pushing their barrows of plums and
pears through the city streets, and though the meeting would, no doubt,
be skilfully packed with partisans, many women would be present and
nothing more than a wordy war would be likely to result.

Lucy saw the date and considered that the question of the matinée was
decided for her. She mentioned the invitation at lunch, and was very
much surprised to find that her brother strongly deprecated her
intention of being present at the discussion and welcomed this
invitation.

""I don't want you to go, dear,"" he said; ""I beg of you not. It will be
rough and bitter. I know it. I shrink from it myself, but I must show
them that we are not afraid to meet them openly. But it would do nothing
but distress you. Write to Miss Poyntz this afternoon and say you'll go.
Then you can hear all about the meeting in the evening when you get
back."" He was so obviously in earnest that Lucy could not but agree.

It seemed fate sent her to meet James. Well, it must be, that was all.
Circumstances must be faced, and if she did not know her own mind now,
it was possible that the event itself would decide it for her.

But she addressed the letter with marked nervous excitement, and the
""Hon. Agatha Poyntz"" was more tremulous than her writing was wont to be.

There were two days more to wait, a Sunday intervened, and she hardly
left the church during the whole day, seeking counsel and help where
only they are to be found.

On Monday, she arrived at the theatre at about two. She had refused to
lunch with her friends and drove from Hornham in a hansom cab, meeting
them at the door of the building.

They went at once to their box and found that there were some five
minutes to wait before the rise of the curtain.

The theatre was curious after the glare of the sun outside, fantastic
and unreal. Hardly anybody talked, though there was a good house, and
the strange quiet of a matinée audience seemed to pervade the four
people in the box also.

Lucy leaned back in her chair with the sensation of dreaming. This
morning she had knelt in the side chapel at St. Elwyn's! A moment before
she had been alone in the cab, among the roar and bustle of Trafalgar
Square. Now she was in a dream. Agatha and Adelaide Lelant smiled at her
without speaking--just like odd dream people. James Poyntz sat just
behind her. She was acutely conscious of his presence. Now and then he
bent forward and made some remark or other in a low voice. That also
seemed to come from a distance. She seemed to have left all the real
things behind in Hornham.

The scents, the dresses of the fashionable people in the stalls, the
dim, apricot light, seemed alien to her life now, a reminder of
experiences and days long since put away and forgotten.

The little band below had been playing a waltz of Weber's, a regret
which was strangled into a sob as the curtain rose suddenly upon the
first act of the play.

How acutely conscious one was at first of the artificial light! The big
frame of the proscenium enclosed a rich garden scene, beautifully
painted. But it was full of hot yellow light, until the eye forgot the
outside day it had lately quitted. Lucy thought that for the sake of
illusion it was a mistake to come to the play in the afternoon. She said
so to James.

""Well,"" he whispered, ""for my part, there is never any illusion in the
stage for me. It is a way of passing an idle hour now and then. That is
all. I came here not to see the play, but to see you.""

She turned towards the stage again with a slight flush.

Behind the footlights the perfectly dressed men and women went through
their parts. All appeared as if they had put on for the first time the
clothes they wore; both men and women had the complexion of young
children--peaches and cream--unless the light fell on the face at an
awkward angle. Then it glistened.

And all the people on the stage talked alike, too. They did not speak
quite like ladies or gentlemen, but imitated the speech of ladies and
gentlemen wonderfully! The play did not interest Lucy. It was a
successful play, it was played by people who were celebrated actors, but
she was out of tune with the whole thing. It wasn't amusing. Between the
acts, Lady Lelant chatted merrily, of such news as there was to be
gleaned during a passage through town. She spoke of the movements of
this or that acquaintance, whom this girl was engaged to, why Lord
Dawlish had quarrelled with the Duke of Dover. Lucy had no interest in
these matters any more. She realised that with astonished certainty. She
didn't care a bit. After all, these smart people and their doings were
not, as she had thought in the past, any more interesting than the group
of church people at St. Elwyn's. Indeed they were less so. Dr. Hibbert,
one or two of the nursing sisters, some of the choir men, King,
Stephens, Carr--all these people had more individuality, _lived,
thought, felt, prayed_ more intensely than Lady Lelant's set, Lady
Linquest's set, any purely fashionable set. There was not a doubt that
in the mere worldly economy of things, in the state politic, every one
of these Hornham people _mattered more_ than those others. And, where
hearts and wills are weighed, to the critical Unseen eyes, their value
was greater still. Lucy was glad when the play began again, and she was
relieved of the necessity for a simulated interest in things she had
long since put away from her.

The last act of the mimic story dragged on. Agatha and Lady Lelant were
absorbed in it. Lucy withdrew a little from the front of the box. She
cared nothing for the play, nor did her companion. Both of them knew of
things imminent in their twin lives greater than any mimic business
could suggest to them.

He began to tell her in a low voice of his joy in seeing her again. It
thrilled her to hear the lover-like tones creeping into a voice so
clear, cold, and self-contained in all the ordinary affairs of life. It
was an experience that disturbed and swayed all the instincts of her
sex. For she knew that this was no ordinary conquest that she had made,
no ordinary tribute to her mind and person. She might have received the
highest compliment that he was about to pay her from many a man as
highly placed and socially fortunate as he. There was no exhilaration,
no subtle flattery of her pride and the consciousness of her womanhood
in that. But she knew him for what he was. She had learned of the
intellect and power of the man--herein lay an exquisite pleasure in his
surrender. And she liked him immensely. Physically, he pleased her eye,
and her sense of what was fitting in a man. Mentally he compelled her.
And now and again in their intimacy, an intimacy that had grown
enormously during the last year, fostered on their mutual epistolary
confidences, she had found a sudden surrender, a boyish leaning on her,
a waiting for her approving or helpful word, that was sweet to her.

At last the curtain fell.

""Now, then,"" Poyntz said, ""we'll go and have tea on the terrace at the
Sardinia. There will be a band, a really good band, and the embankment
will look beautiful just now. Come along, young ladies; we'll walk,
shall we? It won't take us five minutes."" They left the theatre.

""Ah!"" Lucy said with a sudden gasp of relief, ""how good the air is after
that dark place and the stage. My eyes feel as if they had been actually
burnt.""

The long lights of the summer afternoon irradiated everything. There
are moments in summer when the busiest London street seems like a street
in fairy-land. It was so now as they walked to the great riverside
hotel; a tender haze of gold lay over all the vast buildings, the sky
began to be as if it were hung with banners.

They passed from the roar of the street to the great courtyard, with its
gay awnings of white and red, its palms and tree-ferns in green tubs,
its little tables like the tables of a continental café. Little groups
of people of all nationalities sat about there. The party heard the
twanging accent of the United States, the guttural German, the purring,
spitting Russian.

They entered the hotel, walked down a corridor, descended some steps,
and came out upon the terrace.

Lucy had a finely developed social instinct. She knew what was going on
instinctively, and it was plain to her at once that the moment had come.
Agatha Poyntz and her cousin had disappeared as she sat down at a small
table with James, hidden by shrubs from the rest of the terrace.

Below and beyond were gardens in which children were playing, the wide
embankment, and the silver Thames itself, all glowing under the
lengthening sun rays.

What did she feel at that moment? She found that she was calm, her
pulses were quiet, her breathing untroubled and slow.

He leaned forward and took her hands strongly in both of his. At first,
his words came haltingly to him, but then, gathering courage, he made
her a passionate declaration.

Her heart cried out vaguely to some outside power for guidance; her
inarticulate appeal was hardly a prayer, it was the supreme expression
of perplexity and doubt.

""For months, all my work and life have been coloured by thoughts of you,
have had reference to you. I can conceive, since I have been writing to
you, and you to me, I have had hopes and dreams that have become part of
my life! If you could accept this, this devotion, this strong feeling of
love which has grown up in me, I feel that our companionship would be a
beautiful thing. Lucy, I am not eloquent in love as some men are said to
be, I can only tell you that I love and admire you dearly and have no
greater hope than to share everything with you, my lady, my love!""

The strong, self-contained young man was deeply moved. He continued, in
a monologue of singular delicacy and high feeling, to pour out the
repressed feelings of the past year, to offer her a life that was more
stainless--she knew it well--than that of most young men.

She was deeply touched, interested, and rather overawed. But there was
no thrill of passion in her that could answer to the notes of it that
were coming into his voice and shaking it from its firmness, sending
tremulous waves quivering through it.

Her hand shook in his hold, but it was passive. Emotion rushed over her,
but it was a cool emotion, so to say; she was touched, but her blood did
not race and leap at his touch, she felt no wish to rest in his arms, to
find her home there!

At last she was able to speak. There was a pause in his pleading, his
eyes remained fixed upon her face in anxious scrutiny.

She withdrew her hand gently.

""You have touched me very deeply,"" she said. ""But I can't, oh, I _can't_
answer you now. This is such a great thing. There is so much to think
over, so much self-examination. It might all look quite different to
one to-morrow! Let me wait, give me time. I will write to you.""

His ear found the lack of what he sought in her voice. Even to herself
her tones sounded cold and conventional after his impassioned pleading.
But she found herself mistress neither of reason nor of feeling as she
spoke. She was bewildered, though not taken by surprise.

He seemed to understand something of her state of mind. If his
disappointment was keen, he showed nothing of it, realising with the
pertinacity of a strong, vigorous nature that nothing really worth
having was won easily, thankful, perhaps, that he had won as much as he
had--her consideration.

""You know how great a thing this is to me,"" he said. ""You would never be
unkind or hard to me and it would be an unkindness to prolong my
suspense. When will you give me my answer?""

""Oh, soon, soon! But I must have time. I will write to you soon, in a
fortnight I will write.""

""That is so long a time!""

""It will pass very swiftly.""

""Then I accept your decree. But I shall write to you, even if you don't
answer me until I get the letter, oh, happy day! on which you tell me
what my whole heart longs to hear. You will read my letters during the
time of waiting? Promise me that, Lucy.""

""Yes, yes, I promise,"" she said hastily, seeing that Agatha and Adelaide
Lelant were coming towards them.

Her brain was whirling; James himself was agitated and unstrung by the
vehemence of feeling, the nerve storm, that he had just passed through.
And in the minds of Miss Poyntz and Lady Lelant the liveliest curiosity
and interest reigned, as it naturally would reign, under such
circumstances, in the minds of any normal young women, gentle or simple,
with blue blood or crimson.

But the four people had learned the lessons their life-long environment
had taught. Their faces were masks, their talk was trivial.

When at length Lucy rose to go, declining to drive home with Lady
Lelant, they all came into the big, quiet courtyard of the hotel, ""to
help her choose her hansom."" Every unit of the little party felt her
departure would be a relief, she felt it herself. The two girls did not
know what had happened and were eager to know. James wanted to be
alone, to go through the interview step by step in his brain,
reconstructing it for the better surveyal of his chances, and to plan an
epistolary campaign, or bombardment rather.

Lucy felt the desire, a great and pressing desire, for home and rest.
She arrived at the vicarage an hour or so after. As the cab had turned
into the familiar, sordid streets she had felt glad! She smiled at her
own sensations, but they were very real. This place, this ""unutterable
North London slum,"" as she used to call it, was more like home than Park
Lane had ever been.

How tired she felt as she went up-stairs to her room! Her face was pale,
dark circles had come out under her eyes, she bore every evidence of
having passed through some mental strain.

After a bath she felt better, more herself, after these experiences of
the afternoon. And to change every article of clothing was in itself a
restorative and a tonic. It was an old trick of hers, and she had always
found it answer. When she went down-stairs again she was still pale, but
had that freshness and dainty completeness that have such enormous
charm, that she always had, and that her poorer sisters are so unable
to achieve in the _va et vient_ of a hard, work-a-day life.

She wanted to see Bernard, she hungered for her brother. With a pang of
self-reproach, she remembered, as she came down-stairs, that this had
been the afternoon of the public debate with Hamlyn's people. It was an
important event in the parish. And from her start from the clergy-house
to her arrival back at its doors, she had quite forgotten the whole
thing! In the absorption with her own affairs, it had passed completely
from her brain and she was sorry. Of late, she had identified herself so
greatly with the affairs and hopes of the little St. Elwyn's community,
that she felt selfish and ashamed as she knocked at the door of the
study. She waited for a moment to hear the invitation to enter. It was
never safe to go into Bernard's room without that precaution. Some
tragic history might be in the very article of relation, some weary soul
might be there seeking ghostly guidance in its abyss of sorrow and
despair.

Some one bade her enter. She did so. The room was dark, filled with the
evening shadows. For a moment or two, she could distinguish nothing.

""Are you here, Ber?"" she said.

""The vicar is up-stairs, Miss Blantyre,"" came the answer in King's
voice, as he rose from his seat. ""I'm here with Stephens.""

""Well, let me sit down for a little while and talk,"" Lucy said. ""May
I?--please go on smoking. I can stand Bob's pipe, so I can certainly
stand _yours_. I want to hear all about the meeting in the Victoria
Hall.""

They found a chair for her; she refused to have lights brought, saying
that she preferred this soft gloom that enveloped them.

Her question about the meeting was not immediately responded to. The men
seemed collecting their thoughts. By this time, she was really upon
something that resembled a true sisterly footing with these two. Both
were well-bred men, incapable of any slackening of the cords of
courtesy, but there was a mutual understanding between them and her
which allowed deliberation in talk, which, in fact, dispensed with the
necessity of conventional chatter.

King spoke at length. ""Go on, young 'un,"" he said to Stephens, waving
his pipe at him, as Lucy could see by the red glow in the bowl. ""You
tell her.""

""No, _you_ tell her, old chap.""

Lucy wanted to laugh at the odd pair with whom she was in such sympathy.
They were just like two boys.

King sighed. Conversation of any sort, unless it was actually in the
course of his priestly ministrations, was always painful to him. He was
a man who _thought_. But he could be eloquent and incisive enough when
he chose.

""Well, look here, Miss Blantyre,"" he said, ""to begin with, the whole
thing has been an unqualified success for the other side! That is to say
that the people in the hall--and it was crammed--have gone away in the
firm conviction and belief that the Luther Lecturers have got the best
of the priests, that, in short, the Protestants have won all along the
line.""

""Good gracious! Mr. King, do you really mean to say that one of these
vulgar, half-educated men was able to beat Bernard in argument, to
enlist the sympathies of the audience against _Bernard_?""

""That's exactly what has happened,"" King answered. ""The vicar is
up-stairs now, utterly dejected and worn out, trying to get some sleep.""

""But I don't understand how it could be so.""

""It is difficult to understand for a moment, Miss Blantyre. But it's
easily explained. One good thing has happened: Every priest in the
kingdom will have his warning now----""

""Of what?""

""Never to engage in public controversy with any man of the type sent out
to advertise the Luther League. I'll try and explain. You'll know what I
mean. The controversy upon any sacred and religious subjects, subjects
that are very dear to and deeply felt by their defender, is only
possible if their attacker pursues legitimate methods. What happened to
day is this:

""The audience was mostly Protestant, with a strong sprinkling of people
who cared nothing one way or the other, but had come to be amused, or in
the expectation of a row. And even if the meeting wasn't 'packed,'--and
I've my doubts of that,--you see Catholics don't like to come much to
anything of the sort. It is so terribly painful to a man or woman whose
whole life is bound up in the Sacraments, who draws his or her 'grace of
going on' and hope of heaven from them, to sit and hear them mocked and
derided by the coarse, the vulgar, the irreligious. It's an ordeal one
can hardly expect any one to go through without a burning indignation
and a holy wrath, which may, in its turn, give place to action and words
that our Lord has expressly forbidden. One remembers Peter, who cut off
the ear of the High Priest's servant, and how he was rebuked. That's why
there were not many Catholics present, and besides, the chief had asked
many of the congregation to stay away. He wouldn't let Dr. Hibbert go;
he knew that he'd lose his temper and that there would be a row.""

Lucy listened eagerly. ""And what did happen?"" she cried.

""Tell Miss Blantyre, Stephens,"" King answered. ""I'm not lazy, but
Stephens has got colour in his descriptions! It's like his sermons, all
poetry and fervour and no sound discipline! And besides, he's got the
'varsity slang of the day. It's nasty, but it's expressive. When I was
up, we talked English--go on, young 'un.""

His voice sank, his pipe glowed in the gloom. Stephens took up the
parable. ""Well, I can't go into all the details,"" he said. ""But the
first thing that happened was that the lecturer stood upon the platform,
shut his eyes, and prayed that Hornham might be delivered from the
curse of priesthood and the blasphemy of the Mass!--this while the vicar
was on the platform. The man was going to begin right away, after this,
when Mr. Carr stopped him and said that he wished to offer up a prayer
also. The fellow frowned, but he dare not stop him. So Carr prayed for a
quiet and temperate conduct of the meeting! Then the man began. It was
the usual thing, mocking blasphemy delivered in the voice of a
cheap-jack, with a flavour of the clown.

""The man had two sacramental wafers and he kept producing them out of a
Bible, like a conjuring trick! They were of different sizes, and he
said: 'Now, here you see what the Ritualists worship, a biscuit god! And
you'll notice there's a little one for the people and a big one for the
priest--priests always want the biggest share!' Roars of laughter from
every one, of course. Then the fellow went on to speak of the fasting
communion. 'For my part,' he said, with a great grin, 'I like to have my
breakfast comfortable in the morning before I go to church, and I
honestly pity the poor priests who have to starve themselves till
mid-day. I shouldn't wonder if the Reverend Blantyre'--with a wink
towards the vicar--'often has visions of a nice bit of fried bacon or an
'addock, say, about eleven o'clock in the morning.'""

Lucy gasped. ""How utterly revolting,"" she said, ""and people really take
that sort of thing seriously?""

""Oh, yes, the sort of people to whom these Luther Leaguers appeal. You
see it's their only weapon. They can't argue properly, because they are
utterly without education, and they only supplement the parrot lectures
they've been taught with their own native low comedy. Our friend this
afternoon wound up his oration by inviting the vicar to ask
questions--he didn't want him to speak at length, of course. 'Now,' he
said, 'I call upon the Reverend Blantyre to ask me any questions he
chooses. And I'll just ask him one myself--if God had meant him to wear
petticoats, wouldn't He have made him a woman?' This was rather too
much, and there were some hisses. The vicar was in his cassock. But the
vicar laughed himself, and so every one else did. It seemed to restore
the good humour of the meeting, which was just what the lecturer didn't
want.

""Well, to cut a long story short, every question the vicar put was the
question of a cultured man, that is to say, it assumed _some_ knowledge
of the point at issue. Each time he was answered with buffooneries and a
blatant ignorance that gave the whole thing away at once to any one that
_knew_. But there was hardly any one there that did, that was the point.
The whole audience imagined that we were being scored off tremendously.
They got noisy, cheered every apish witticism of the lecturer--oh! it
was a disgusting scene. I'll give you an instance of what was said
towards the end. The vicar was appealing to the actual words of the
Gospel in one instance. 'The Greek text says,' he was beginning, when
the man jumps up--'Greek!' he shouted, 'will Greek save a man's soul?
_Do you suppose Jesus of Nazareth understood foreign tongues?_'

""There was a tremendous roar of applause from the people at this. They
thought the lecturer had made a great point! They actually _did_! Well,
of course, there was hardly any answer to that. In the face of such
black depths of ignorance, what _could_ any one do? It would be as easy
to explain the theory of gravity to a hog as to explain the Faith to a
grinning, hostile mob like that. The vicar sat down. The clown always
has the last word in argument before an audience of fools or children.
It must be so.""

""How did it all end up?""

""Oh, the lecturer got upon his hind legs again and made a speech in
which he claimed to have triumphantly refuted the sophistry of the vicar
and to have shown what Ritualism really was. Then, encouraged by the
general applause, he was beginning to be very personal and rude, when
there was a startling interruption. Bob got up from the back of the
hall--we didn't know he was there--and began to push his way towards the
platform, with a loudly expressed intention of wringing the lecturer's
neck there and then. I got hold of him, but he shook me off like a fly.
'Let me be, sir!' he said, 'let me get at the varmin, I'll give him a
thick ear, I will!' Then King saw what was going on and rushed up. Bob
remembered what King gave him last year and he tried to dodge. By this
time, the whole place was in an uproar, sticks were flying about, people
were struggling, shouting, swearing, and it looked like being as nasty a
little riot as one could wish to see.""

""How _horrible_!"" Lucy said with a shudder. ""I wish Bernard had never
been near the place.""

""Well, then, all of a sudden,"" the curate continued, ""a mighty voice was
heard from the platform. It was Carr! I never heard a man with such a
big, arresting voice. He was in a white rage, his eyes flashed, he
looked most impressive. He frightened every one, he really did, and in a
minute or two he got every one to leave the hall quietly and in order.""

""How splendid!"" Lucy said. She thought that she could see the whole
scene, the squalid struggle, the strong man dominating it all. Her hands
were clenched in sympathy. Her teeth were locked.

""He's a big man,"" the young fellow replied, ""a bigger man than any one
knows. He'll be round here this evening, I expect. You must get him to
tell you all about it, Miss Blantyre.""

A few minutes afterwards every one went to church. It was a choral
evensong that night, and sung somewhat later than the usual service was.
Blantyre did not appear. Lucy would not have him wakened. She knew that
sleep was the best thing for over-tired nerves, that he would view the
futile occurrences of the afternoon less unhappily after sleep.

It was after nine o'clock when the vicar eventually made his appearance.
He was worn and sad in face, his smile had lost its merriment. Lucy had
made them all come into her room for music. They wanted playing out of
their depression, and in ministering to them she forgot her own quandary
and perplexities. At last the light, melodious numbers of _Faust_ and
_Carmen_ had some influence with them, and about ten the three men were
visibly brighter. They were in the habit of taking a cup of tea before
going to bed; to-night Lucy made them have soup instead.

It was a few minutes after the hour, when the bell rang; in a moment or
two, Bob--extremely anxious to efface himself as much as possible after
the event of the afternoon--showed Mr. Carr into the drawing-room.

His face was very white and set. ""I am extremely sorry,"" he said, ""to
call on you so late, but have you seen the evening papers, any of you?""
No one had seen them.

""I'm afraid there is something that will give you great pain, a great
shock. It has grieved me deeply, it must be worse for you, my
friend--thinking as you do of the Eucharist.""

""What is it?"" Father Blantyre said.

Carr held out an evening paper. ""Briefly,"" he said, ""while we were at
the meeting down here, Hamlyn, Senior, had a special gathering of
extreme Protestants in Exeter Hall. He produced a _consecrated wafer_
and exhibited it, stating that he had purloined it from the Holy
Communion service the day before. This was corroborated by two men who
went with him and were witnesses of the act.""

Every vestige of colour left the faces of the three priests of St.
Elwyn's. Suddenly Blantyre gave a little moan and fainted, sinking on to
a couch behind him.

They brought him round without much trouble, and King helped him
up-stairs to bed, refusing to let him go into the church as he wished.
Lucy saw that tears were falling silently over the grim, heavy face of
King.

When the vicar was safely bestowed in his room, Stephens and King,
saying nothing to each other, but acting with a common impulse, went
into the church. In the side chapel, where the dim red glow of the
sanctuary-lamp was the only light, they remained on their knees all
night, praying before the Blessed Sacrament.




CHAPTER XII

THE REPARATION OF JANE PRITCHETT, EX-PROTESTANT


On the following morning, Blantyre went away. He was absent from Hornham
for two days, and it was understood that he had gone to visit Lord
Huddersfield. Hamlyn and his doings were not in any way mentioned by the
two other clergy.

The days of his absence were a time of great unrest and mental debate
for Lucy.

She was at a crisis in her life. She had definitely come to a moment
when she must choose between one thing or another. It is a commonplace
of some preachers to say that this moment of definite choice comes to
every one at least once in their lives. But the truth of the assertion
is at least doubtful. Many people are spared the pain of what is more or
less an instantaneous decision. They merge themselves gradually, in this
or that direction, the right or the wrong. And they are the more
fortunate.

For Lucy, however, the tide was at the flood. She must push out upon it
and hoist her sail, but whether she should go east or west, run before
the wind or beat up into the heart of it--that she must now decide.

She had no illusions about her position. To marry James Poyntz meant one
thing, to refuse him meant another. In the first place, she wanted to be
married. Physically, socially, mentally, she was perfectly aware that
she would be happier. Her nature needed the complement of a husband. She
was pure, but not virginal, in temperament. She put it to herself
that--as she believed--she had a talent for wifehood.

Here was a young man who satisfied all her instincts of what was fitting
in a man she could marry. She did not love him, but she admired, liked,
and respected him. Something of the not unhealthy cynicism--the sane
cynicism--of a woman of the world had entered into her. She wasn't a
sentimentalist, she didn't think that the ""love"" of the poet and
story-teller was the only thing in the relation of a wife to a husband.
She had seen many marriages, she had watched the firm, strong affection
that came after marriage, and she saw that it was a good, worthy, and
constant thing.

She had been much in France. Lady Linquest had friends and relatives
among the stately families of the Faubourg St. Germain. Those weddings
in France that were decorously arranged by papa and mamma, how did they
turn out? On the whole well enough, happily enough. It was only the
ignorant lower middle-class of England that thought France was a mighty
_lupanar_ and adultery a joke.

And in marrying Poyntz she would marry a man whom she was worthy of
intellectually. He would satisfy every instinct she possessed--_every
instinct but one_.

And here, she knew, here lay the root of the whole question.

The very strongest influence that can direct and urge any soul towards a
holy life is the society and companionship, even the distant
contemplation, of a saintly man or woman.

The force of example acts as a lens. It focuses all the impulses towards
good and concentrates them. In making clear the beauty of holiness, it
shows that it is not a vague beauty, but an ideal which may be realised
by the observer.

Lucy had been living with saintly folk. Bernard was saintly--if ever a
man was; the bulldog, King, was a saint and walked with God. Stephens
was a schoolboy, full of slang and enthusiasm, blunders and love of
humanity, but he was saintly too. Miss Cass, the housekeeper with the
face of a horse, who called ""day"" ""dy"" and the Mass ""Mess,"" she was a
holy woman. Before the ugly, unlettered spinster, the society girl, with
all her power and charm, had learned to bow in her mind.

That was Lucy's great virtue. She was frank with herself. She glossed
over nothing, she pretended nothing. It is the person who postures and
poses before himself who is in the chiefest danger. And Carr, well, Carr
was a saintly man also. He hadn't got the more picturesque trimmings
that the others had. His spiritual life was not so vividly expressed in,
and witnessed to, by his clothes and daily habit of life. But he was a
saintly man. As she thought of him Lucy thought of him as man _and_
saint.

All these people lived for one thing, had one aim, believed one thing.

They lived to serve our Lord, to do His work, to adore Him.

Why, even Bob, the navvy, whom Father King had knocked down as a beery
blackguard and set up again as a butler, even Bob was feeling a slow
and ponderous way towards sainthood! He could not boast a first-rate
intelligence, but, he _loved_ our Lord.

Yes!--ah, that was the most beautiful thing of all. To _love_ Him.

""Do I _love_ Him?"" Lucy asked herself during those two days.

And the answer that came to her was a very strange one. It was this. She
loved our Lord, but she could not make up her mind to give up everything
earthly and material for Him. She wanted a compromise.

In fact, she was near the gates of the spiritual life, but she had not
entered them.

She did not disguise one fact from herself. If she married Poyntz she
would immediately be withdrawn, and withdrawn for ever, from the new
influences which were beginning to permeate her, to draw her towards the
state of a Christian who is vowed and militant.

She knew the influence that as her husband James would have. His ideals
were noble and high, his life was pure and worthy. But it was not the
life that Christ had made so plain and clear. The path the Church showed
was not the path James would follow, or one which as his wife she could
well follow.

She believed sincerely, as her brother himself would have told her, that
a man like Poyntz was only uneducated in spiritual things, not lost to
them for ever.

But she was also sure that he would make no spiritual discoveries in
this world.

Marriage with him meant going back. It meant turning away from the
Light.

The struggle with the training of years, the earthly ideals of nearly
all her life, was acute. But hour by hour, she began to draw nearer and
nearer to the inevitable solution.

Now and again, she went into the silent church. Then, kneeling before
the Blessed Sacrament, she saw the path quite clear.

Afterwards, back in her room again, the voices of the material world
were heard. But they became weaker and more weak as the hours went on.

On the day that Bernard was to return, she received a long and
passionate letter from her lover.

He had the wonderful gift of prose. He understood, as hardly any of us
understand, how to treat words (on certain occasions of using them) as
if they were almost notes in some musical composition. His letter was
beautiful.

She read it page by page, with a heart that had begun to beat with
quickened interest, until she came to a passage which jarred and hurt.
James had made an end of his most impassioned and intimate passages, and
was making his keen satiric comment upon general affairs--quite as he
had done in his letters before his actual avowal.

""I saw my father to-day in St. James, and we went to his club and
lunched together. I respect him more and more, for his consistency,
every time I meet him. And I wonder more and more at his childishness at
the same time. It seems he had just left your brother. As you are in the
thick of all the mumbo-jumbo, perhaps you will have heard of the
business that seems to be agitating my poor dear sire into a fever. It
seems that, a day or two ago, an opposition hero who has consecrated his
life to the Protestant cause--none other than the notorious Hamlyn
himself--purloined a consecrated wafer from some church and has been
exhibiting it at public meetings to show that it is just as it ever
was--a pinch of flour and no more. My father has made himself utterly
miserable over the proceedings of this merry-andrew. As you know, I take
but little interest in the squabbles of the creeds, but the spectacle
of a sane and able man caught up in the centre of these phantasies makes
me pause and makes my contempt sweeten into pity.""

As Lucy read the letter, she thought of the scene on the night when Carr
had brought the news. She thought of her own quick pain as she heard it,
of how her brother was struck down as with a sword. And especially there
came to her the vision of the two priests, King and Stephens, praying
all night long before the Host.

She pushed the letter away from her, nor did she read it again. It
seemed alien, out of tune with her life.

She went into the church to pray.

When she came away, her resolution was nearly taken.

Bernard came home about three in the afternoon. His manner was quiet. He
was sad, but he seemed relieved also.

Lucy was walking in the garden with him, soon after his return, when
Stephens and Dr. Hibbert came down from the house and walked quickly up
to them.

""Vicar,"" the doctor said, ""Miss Pritchett is dying.""

Blantyre started. ""Oh, I didn't know it was as bad as that,"" he said.
""Is it imminent?""

""A matter of twenty hours I should say,"" the doctor replied; ""I bring
you a message from her.""

Blantyre's face lighted up. Great tenderness came over it as he heard
that the woman who had injured him and sought to harm the Church had
sent him a message.

""Poor woman,"" he said; ""what is it--God bless her!""

""She has asked for you and the other clergy to come to her. She wishes
me to bring you and such other members of the congregation as will come.
She wishes to make a profession of Faith.""

""But when, how--"" the vicar asked, bewildered.

The doctor explained. ""The Hamlyns are with her; she is frightened by
them, but not only that, she bitterly repents what she has done. Poor
soul! Blantyre, she is very penitent, she remembers the Faith. She
asks--"" He drew the vicar aside. Lucy could hear no more. But she saw
deep sympathy come out upon her brother's face.

The three men--Stephens had remained with the doctor--came near her
again.

""My motor is outside,"" the doctor said hurriedly.

""How long would it take?"" asked the vicar.

""----if the Bishop is in--back in an hour and a half----""

The vicar took Stephens aside and spoke earnestly with him for a few
moments. The young man listened gravely and then hurried away. Before
the vicar and the doctor joined Lucy again--they stood in private talk a
moment--she heard the ""toot"" of the motor-car hum on the other side of
the garden wall.

Wondering what all this might mean, she was about to cross the lawn
towards the two men, when she saw Father King and Mr. Carr coming out of
the house. These two joined the vicar and Dr. Hibbert. The four men
stood in a ring. Blantyre seemed to be explaining something to the
new-comers. Now and then the doctor broke in with a burst of rapid
explanation.

Lucy began to be full of wonder. She felt ignored, she tried not to feel
that. Something was afoot that she did not quite understand.

In the middle of her wonder the men came towards her.

Bernard took her arm. ""Mavourneen,"" he said, ""will you come with us to
poor Miss Pritchett? She's been asking if you'll come and forgive her
and part good friends. She may die to-night, the doctor says. You'll
come?""

""Of course I'll come, dear.""

""She has repented of her hostility to the Church, and desires to make a
public statement of her faith before she dies. And she has asked for the
Sacrament of Unction.... Stephens has gone to the Bishop of Stepney on
the doctor's motor-car. In an hour we will go to Malakoff.""

The doctor took King by the arm and led him away. They talked earnestly
together.

Blantyre turned to Carr.

""Will ye come with us all to the poor soul's bedside?"" he asked.

""Yes,"" Carr answered. ""I don't know what you purpose exactly--and I
don't care! I trust you as a brother now, Blantyre, I am learning every
day. I'm a conservative, you know, new things are distasteful to me. But
I am learning that there are medicines, _pro salute animæ_.""

""New things!"" Blantyre said; ""ye're an old Protestant at heart still.
Did they teach ye _no_ history at Cambridge except that the Church of
England began at the Reformation? Now, listen while I tell you what the
service is. You remember St. James v. 14, 15?""

Carr nodded. He began to quote from memory, for his knowledge of the
Scriptures was profound, a knowledge even more accurate and full than
perhaps any of the three priests of St. Elwyn's could claim, though they
were scholars and students one and all.

""Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of our Lord;
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
him up, and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.""

""Well, I suppose that is fairly explicit?"" Blantyre said. ""Mr. Hamlyn
would tell us that Unction is a conjuring trick invented by the Jesuits.
And you have always thought it Popish and superstitious. Now, haven't
you, Carr, be honest!""

""Yes.""

""Well, you will see the service to-day. We follow the ancient order of
the Church of England. Why did you object, Carr? I'd like to get at
your mental attitude. What is there unscriptural, bad, or unseemly about
Unction? Here's a poor woman who has strayed from the fold. She wishes
to die at peace with every one, she wishes that the inward unction of
the Holy Spirit may be poured into the wounds of her soul, she wants to
be forgiven for the sake of our Lord's most meritorious Cross and
Passion! If it is God's will, she may be cured.""

He spoke with great fervour and earnestness.

Carr bowed his head and thought. ""Yes,"" he said, ""I have been very
prejudiced and hard, sometimes. It is so easy to condemn what one does
not know about, so hard to have sympathy with what one has not
appreciated.""

Blantyre caught him by the arm and they walked the lawn for a long time
in fraternal intercourse.

Lucy sat down with the doctor, but her eyes often turned to the tall,
grave figure, whose lengthening shadow sometimes reached to her feet and
touched them.

At last they heard the panting of the returning motor-car. Stephens had
arrived with the oil that the Bishop had blessed.

The whole party got into the car, which was a large one, and they set
off rapidly through the streets towards Malakoff House.

How strange it was, Lucy thought, this swift career of moderns in the
wonderful machine of their age, this rush to the bedside of a dying
woman with the last consolation of the Church! It was full of awe, but
full of sweetness also. It seemed to show--and how plainly--the divine
continuity of the Faith, the harmonic welding of the order and
traditions of our Lord's own time with the full vivid life of the
nineteenth century.

They were shown into the grim house. Truly the shadow of death seemed to
lie there, was exhaled from the massive funereal furniture of a bygone
generation, with all its faded pomp and circumstance.

The mistress of it all was going away from it for ever, would never hold
her tawdry court in that grim drawing-room any more.

Dr. Coxe, Hibbert's assistant, came down-stairs and met them.

""I have got the two Hamlyns out of the house at last,"" he whispered.
""They were distressing the patient greatly. I insisted, however. We had
a row on the stairs--fortunately, I don't think the patient could hear
it. I'm sorry, doctor, but I had to use a little physical persuasion to
the young one.""

""Never mind, Coxe,"" Hibbert answered. ""I'll see that nothing comes of
it. They won't dare to do anything. I will see to that. Is Miss
Pritchett ready? Can we go up?""

""Yes,"" the young man answered, looking curiously at the four priests and
the grave girl who was with them in her gay summer frock. ""Miss Davies
is there.""

He was a big, young Scotsman, with a profound contempt for religion, but
skilled and tender in his work, nevertheless.

""Will you come up?"" Hibbert whispered, taking him a little apart from
the others.

""I'd rather be excused, old man,"" he answered. ""Call me if I'm wanted. I
can't stand this mumbo-jumbo, you know!""

Hibbert nodded curtly. He understood the lad very well. ""Will you follow
me, Father?"" he said to Blantyre.

Blantyre put on his surplice and stole. Then they all went silently up
the wide stairs, with their soft carpet and carved balusters, into the
darkened chamber of death.

The dying woman was propped up by pillows. Her face was the colour of
grey linen, the fringes of hair she wore in health were gone.

A faint smile came to her lips. Then, as she saw Lucy, she called to her
in a clear, thin voice that seemed as if it came from very far away.

""Kiss me, my dear,"" she said; ""forgive me.""

Lucy kissed the old, wrinkled face tenderly. Her tears fell upon it in a
sacrament of forgiveness and holy amity.

""I want just to say to all of you,"" Miss Pritchett said, ""that I have
been untrue to what I really believed, and I have helped the enemies of
the Faith. I never forgot your teaching, Father, I knew all the time I
was doing wrong. I ask all of you to forgive me as I believe Jesus has
forgiven me.""

A murmur of kindliness came from them all.

""Then I can go in peace,"" she gasped. Then with a faint and pathetic
shadow of her old manner she turned to Gussie. ""Hush!"" she said. ""Stop
sniffling, Miss Davies! I am very happy. Now, Father----""

Her eyes closed and her hands remained still. They saw all earthly
thoughts die out of the wrinkled old face, now turned wholly to God.

They all knelt save the vicar, who had placed the oil in an ampulla upon
a table.

Then he began the 71st Psalm. ""In Thee, O Lord, have I put my trust, let
me never be put to confusion: but rid me, and deliver me, in Thy
righteousness, incline Thine ear unto me, and save me.""

There was no sound in the chamber save that of the ancient Hebrew song.

""Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am grey-headed: until I
have showed Thy strength unto this generation, and Thy power to all them
that are yet for to come.

""Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that
Thou hast done; O God, who is like unto Thee?""

Then, all together, they said the antiphon: ""_O Saviour of the world,
who by Thy Cross and precious Blood hast redeemed us, save us and help
us, we humbly beseech Thee, O Lord._""

The central figure in the huge four-post bed lay still and waxen. But
when the priest came up to it with the oil, the eyes opened and looked
steadfastly into his face.

He dipped his thumb into the silver vessel and made the sign of the
Cross on the eyes, the ears, the lips, the nostrils, and the hands,
saying each time as he did so:

""_Through this unction, and of His most tender mercy, may the Lord
pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed._""

The whispering words that brought renewal of lost innocence to the dying
woman sank into Lucy's heart, never to leave it. In the presence of
these wondrous mysteries, death, and death vanquished by Christ, sin
purged and forgiven in the Sacrament, her resolution was made. She knew
that she would fix her eyes upon the Cross, never to take them from it
more.

She saw her brother bending over the still figure, his white surplice
ghostlike in the gloom of the hangings, as he wiped the anointed parts
with wool.

Then Stephens brought him a basin of clear water and he washed his
hands.

Raising his arm, he said:

""_In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, may
this anointing with oil be to thee for the purification of thy mind and
body, and may it fortify and defend thee against the darts of evil
spirits._ Amen.""

Two more prayers were said and then came the Blessing.

All rose from their knees. As Lucy slipped from the room, she saw the
doctor was bending over the waxen figure in the bed.

She heard her brother and his two assistant priests beginning other
prayers, in a louder voice, a sort of litany, it seemed.

She found Carr was beside her descending the stairs.

""What is that?"" she whispered.

""The prayers for the commendation of a departing soul; she is going. God
rest her and give her peace.""

""Amen,"" said Lucy.

They came down into the hall, where they stood for a moment quite alone.
Both were greatly agitated, both felt drawn together by some great
power.

""How beautiful it is!"" Carr said at length. ""Our Lord is with her. May
we all die so.""

""Poor, dear woman!""

""In a few moments she will be in the supreme and ineffable glory of
Paradise. I want to see trees and flowers, to think happily of the
wonderful mercy and goodness of God among the things He has made. I
should like to walk in the park for an hour, to hear the birds and see
the children play. Will you come with me?""

""Yes, I will come.""

He took her hand and bowed low over it.

""I have a great thing to ask of you,"" he said.

They walked soberly together until they came to the railed-in open
space. To each the air seemed thick with unspoken thoughts.

The park was a poor place enough. But flowers grew there, the grass was
green, it was not quite Hornham. They sat upon a bench and for a minute
or two both were silent. Lucy knew a serenity at this moment such as she
had hardly ever known. She was as some mariner who, at the close of a
long and tempestuous voyage, comes at even-tide towards harbour over a
still sea. The coastwise lights begin to glimmer, the haven is near.

In her mind and heart, at that moment, she was reconciled to and in tune
with all that is beautiful in human and Divine.

She sat there, this well-known society girl, who, all her life, had
lived with the great and wealthy of the world, in great content. In the
""park"" of Hornham, with the poor clergyman, she knew supreme content.

In a low voice that shook with the intensity of his feeling and yet was
resolute and informed with strength, Carr asked Lucy to be his wife.

She gave him her hand very simply and happily. A river that had long
been weary had at last wound safe to sea. That she should be the wife of
this man was, she knew, one of the gladdest and most merciful ordinances
of God.




CHAPTER XIII

THE ARCHBISHOP AND THE HAMLYNS


""Gussie Davies says that she's sure that Miss Pritchett hasn't added a
codicil,"" said Mr. Sam Hamlyn, coming into the inner room at the offices
of the Luther League.

Mr. Hamlyn, Senior, had been at work for some hours, but his son had
only just arrived in the Strand. It was the day after Miss Pritchett's
death, and Sam had remained in North London to make a few inquiries.

""What a blessing of Providence,"" said the secretary. ""There's something
to be said for a ritualistic way of dying, after all! If it 'adn't been
for her messing about with the oil and that, she'd have sent for her
solicitor and cut the League out of her will! The priests have been
'oist with their own petard this time.""

""I wonder how much it'll be,"" Sam said reflectively.

""I don't anticipate a penny less than two thousand pound,"" said Mr.
Hamlyn, triumphantly. ""P'raps a good bit over. You see, we got 'er just
at the last moment. It was me taking the consecrated wafer did it. She
woke up as pleased as Punch, it gave her strength for the afternoon, and
had the lawyer round at once. I never thought she'd go off so sudden,
though.""

""Nor did I, Pa. Well, it's a blessing that she was able to contribute
her mite towards Protestant Truth before she went.""

""What?"" said Mr. Hamlyn sharply; ""mite?--has Gussie Davies any idea of
'ow much the legacy is, then?""

""I only spoke figuratively like, Father.""

""How you startled me, Sam!"" said the secretary, his face resuming its
wonted expression of impudent good humour.

""How's the cash list to-day?"" Sam asked.

""Pretty fair,"" answered his father, ""matter of five pound odd. It's me
getting hold of that wafer, it's sent the subscriptions up wonderful. I
wouldn't part----""

Sam, who was sitting with his back to the door of the room, saw his
father's jaw drop suddenly. His voice died away with a murmur, his face
went pale, his eyes protruded.

The younger man wheeled round his chair. Then he started up, with an
exclamation of surprise and fear.

Both the Protestant champions, indeed, behaved as if they had been
discovered in some fraud by an agent of the law.

Two people had come suddenly into the room, without knocking or being
announced. The secretaries saw the blanched face of a clerk behind them.

During its existence, the Luther League had welcomed some fairly
well-known folk within its doors.

This afternoon, however, a most unexpected honour had been paid to
it--probably the reason of Hamlyn's extreme uneasiness.

A broad, square man of considerable height, with a stern, furrowed face,
wearing an apron and gaiters, stood there, with a thunder-cloud of anger
on his face.

It was His Grace, the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Lord Huddersfield was with him.

The Archbishop looked steadfastly at Hamlyn for a few seconds. His face
was terrible.

In the presence of the great spiritual lord who is next to the royal
family in the precedence of the realm, the famous scholar, the caustic
wit, the utter force and _power_ of intellect, the two champions were
dumb. Hamlyn had never known anything like it before. The fellow's
bounce and impudence utterly deserted him.

The Archbishop spoke. His naturally rather harsh and strident voice was
rendered tenfold more penetrating and terrifying by his wrath.

""Sir,"" he said, in a torrent of menacing sound, ""you have profaned the
Eucharist, you have mocked the holy things of God, you have made the
most sacred ordinance of our Lord a mountebank show. You boast that you
have purloined the Consecrated Bread from church, you have exhibited it.
Restore it to me, wretched man that you are. By the authority of God, I
demand you to restore it; by my authority as head of the English Church,
I order you.""

Hamlyn shrank from the terrible old man clothed in the power of his
great office and the majesty of his holy anger, shrank as a man shrinks
from a flame.

With shaking hands he took a bunch of keys from his pocket. He dropped
them upon the floor, unable to open the lock of the safe.

Young Hamlyn picked them up. He turned the key in the wards with a loud
click and pulled at the massive door until it slowly swung open.

Lord Huddersfield knelt down.

Hamlyn took from a shelf a little box that had held elastic bands.

The Archbishop started and flushed a deep crimson.

He took a pyx from his pocket and reverently took out the desecrated
Host from the box, placing it in the pyx.

Then, with a face that was suffused to a deep purple, he touched the
kneeling peer upon the shoulder. Lord Huddersfield rose with a deep sob
of relief.

The Archbishop looked _once_ at Hamlyn, a look the man never forgot.

Then the two visitors turned and went away as swiftly and silently as
they had come.

It was a long time before either father or son spoke a word.

At last Hamlyn cleared his throat and mouthed a sentence. It would not
come. All that Sam could catch were the words

     ""PROTESTANT TRUTH!""

When It Was Dark

The Story of a Great Conspiracy

By GUY THORNE

Author of ""A Lost Cause""

""The most enthralling and interest-compelling work of fiction this
reviewer has ever encountered.""--_The American, Nashville._

""It is in its wonderful tonic effect upon Christianity in England that
the book is showing its most remarkable effects. It has become the theme
of hundreds of sermons, and long extracts are being printed in the
secular press as well as in the religious publications. It is known to
have been the cause of a number of revivals throughout England, and its
strange effect is increasing daily.""--_N. Y. American._

THE BISHOP OF LONDON preaching at Westminster Abbey said: ""I wonder if
any of my hearers have read that remarkable work of fiction 'When It Was
Dark.' The author paints in wonderful colors what would be the condition
of the world if (as in the story is supposed to be the case) a
conviction had come upon the people that the resurrection had never
occurred.""

""A critical handling of current journalism, ecclesiasticalism, and
liberalism. A novel written from the inside as well as from observation;
and from the heart as well as from the head.""--_Congregationalist._

The Scarlet Pimpernel

By Baroness Orczy

_Author of ""The Emperor's Candlesticks,"" etc._

A dramatic romance of the French Revolution and the Émigré Nobles. The
""Scarlet Pimpernel"" was the chief of a daring band of young Englishmen
leagued together to rescue members of the French nobility from the
Terrorists of France. The identity of the brilliant and resourceful
leader is sacredly guarded by his followers and eagerly sought by the
agents of the French Revolutionary Government. Scenes of intrigue,
danger, and devotion, follow close one upon another. The heroine is a
charming, fearless woman who in the end shares the honors with the
""Scarlet Pimpernel."" In a stage version prepared by the author _The
Scarlet Pimpernel_ was one of the dramatic successes of the last London
season, Mr. Fred Terry and Miss Julia Neilson acting the leading rôles.

""Something distinctly out of the common, well conceived, vividly told,
and stirring from start to finish.""--_London Telegraph._

At the Sign of The Jack o' Lantern

_By_ MYRTLE REED

Author of ""Lavender and Old Lace,"" ""The Master's Violin,"" etc.

A genial story of the adventures of a New York newspaper man and his
young wife, who, at the end of their honeymoon, go to an unexplored
heirloom in the shape of a peculiar old house, where many strange and
amusing things happen. There is a mystery in the house, as well as a
significant portrait of an uncanny cat. A vein of delicate humor, and a
homely philosophy runs through the story.

""Miss Reed is delightfully witty, delightfully humorous, delightfully
cynical, delightfully sane, and above all, delightfully
spontaneous.""--_Philadelphia Telegraph._

Love Alone is Lord

_By_ F. Frankfort Moore

_Author of ""The Jessamy Bride,"" etc._

This latest story by the author of _The Jessamy Bride_ has for its theme
the only really ideal love affair in the romantic life of Lord Byron.
The story opens during the poet's boyhood and tells of his early
devotion to his cousin, Mary Chaworth. Mr. Moore has followed history
very closely, and his descriptions of London society when Byron was the
rage are as accurate as they are dramatic. Lady Caroline Lamb figures
prominently in the story, but the heroine continues to be Byron's early
love, Mary Chaworth. His attachment for his cousin was the strongest and
most enduring of his life, and it failed of realization only by the
narrowest of chances.

ELI

By Heman White Chaplin

1887

First published in the “Century Magazine.”





I.

Under a boat, high and dry at low tide, on the beach, John Wood was
seated in the sand, sheltered from the sun in the boat's shadow,
absorbed in the laying on of verdigris. The dull, worn color was rapidly
giving place to a brilliant, shining green. Occasionally a scraper,
which lay by, was taken up to remove the last trace of a barnacle.

It was Wood's boat, but he was not a boatman; he painted cleverly, but
he was not a painter. He kept the brown store under the elms of the main
street, now hot and still, where at this-moment his blushing sister was
captivating the heart of an awkward farmer's boy as she sold him a pair
of striped suspenders.

As the church clock struck the last of twelve decided blows, three
children came rushing out of the house on the bank above the beach. It
was one of those deceptive New England cottages, weather-worn without,
but bright and bountifully home-like within,--with its trim parlor,
proud of a cabinet organ; with its front hall, now cooled by the light
sea-breeze drifting through the blind-door, where a tall clock issued
its monotonous call to a siesta on the rattan lounge; with its spare
room, open now, opposite the parlor, and now, too, drawing in the salt
air through close-shut blinds, in anticipation of the joyful arrival
this evening of Sister Sarah, with her little brood, from the city.

The children scampered across the road, and then the eldest hushed the
others and sent a little brother ahead to steal, barefoot, along the
shining sea-weed to his father.

The plotted surprise appeared to succeed completely. The painter was
seized by the ears from behind, and captured.

“Guess who 's here, or you can't get up,” said the infant captor.

“It 's Napoleon Bonaparte; don't joggle,” said his father, running a
brush steadily along the water-line.

“No! no! no!” with shouts of laughter from the whole attacking party.

“Then it's Captain Ezekiel.”

This excited great merriment: Captain Ezekiel was an aged, purblind man,
who leaned on a cane.

After attempts to identify the invader--with the tax-collector come for
taxes, then with the elderly minister making a pastoral call, with the
formal schoolmaster, and with Samuel J. Tilden--the victim reached over
his shoulder, and, seizing the assailant by a handful of calico jacket,
brought him around, squirming, before him.

“Now,” he said, “I 'll give you a coat of verdigris. (Great applause
from the reserve force behind.)

“I suppose Mother sent you to say dinner's ready,” said the father,
rising and surveying the green bottom of the boat. “I must eat quick, so
as to do the other side before half-flood.”

And with a child on each shoulder, and the third pushing him from
behind with her head, he marched toward the vine-covered kitchen, where,
between two opposite netted doors, the table was trimly set.

“Father, you look like a mermaid, with your green hands,” said his wife,
laughing, as she handed him the spirits of turpentine. “A woman could
paint that boat, in a light dress, and not get a spot on her.”

He smiled good-naturedly: he never spoke much.

“I guess Louise won't have much trade today,” said his wife, as they all
sat down; “it's so hot in the sun that everybody 'll wait till night.
But she has her tatting-work to do, and she 's got a book, too, that she
wanted to finish.”

Her husband nodded, and ate away.

“Oh, can't we go up street and see her, this afternoon?” said one of the
children.

“Who can that be?” said the mother, as an elderly, half-official-looking
man stopped his horse at the front gate and alighted. The man left the
horse unchecked to browse by the roadside, and came to the door.

“Oh, it 's you, Captain Nourse,” said Wood, rising to open the netting
door, and holding out his hand. “Come to summons me as a witness in
something about the bank case, I suppose. Let me introduce Captain
Nourse, Mary,” he said, “deputy sheriff. Sit down, Captain, and have
some dinner with us.”

“No, I guess I won't set,” said the captain. “I cal'lated not to eat
till I got home, in the middle o' the afternoon. No, I 'll set down in
eye-shot of the mare, and read the paper while you eat.”

“I hope they don't want me to testify anywhere to-day,” said Wood;
“because my boat's half verdigris'd, and I want to finish her this
afternoon.”

“No testimony to-day,” said the captain. “Hi! hi! Kitty!” he called to
the mare, as she began to meander across the road; and he went out to
a tree by the front fence, and sat down on a green bench, beside a
work-basket and a half-finished child's dress, and read the country
paper which he had taken from the office as he came along.

After dinner Wood went out bareheaded, and leaned on the fence by the
captain. His wife stood just inside the door, looking out at them.

The “bank case” was the great sensation of the town, and Wood was one
of the main witnesses, for he had been taking the place of the absent
cashier when the safe was broken open and rifled to the widespread
distress of depositors and stockholders, and the ruin of Hon. Edward
Clark, the president. Wood had locked the safe on the afternoon before
the eventful night, and had carried home the key with him, and he was to
testify to the contents of the safe as he had left it.

“I guess they 're glad they 've got such a witness as John,” said his
wife to herself, as she looked at him fondly, “and I guess they think
there won't be much doubt about what he says.”

“Well, Captain,” said Wood, jocosely, breaking a spear of grass to bits
in his fingers, “I did n't know but you 'd come to arrest me.”

The captain calmly smiled as only a man can smile who has been accosted
with the same humorous remark a dozen times a day for twenty years.
He folded his paper carefully, put it in his pocket, took off
his spectacles and put them in their silver case, took a red silk
handkerchief from his hat, wiped his face, and put the handkerchief
back. Then he said shortly,--

“That's what I _have_ come for.”

Wood, still leaning on the fence, looked at him, and said nothing.

“That's just what I 've come for,” said Captain Nourse. “I 've got to
arrest you; here's the warrant.” And he handed it to him.

“What does this mean?” said Wood. “I can't make head or tail of this.”

“Well,” said the captain, “the long and short is, these high-toned
detectives that they 've hed down from town, seein' as our own force
was n't good enough, allow that the safe was unlocked with a key, in due
form, and then the lock was broke afterward, to look as if it had been
forced open. They 've hed the foreman of the safe-men down, too, and he
says the same thing. Naturally, the argument is, there was only two keys
in existence,--one was safe with the president of the bank, and is about
all he 's got to show out of forty years' savings; the only other one
you hed: consequently, it heaves it onto you.”

“I see,” said Wood. “I will go with you. Do you want to come into the
house with me while I get my coat?”

“Well, I suppose I must keep you in sight,--now you know.”

And they went into the house.

“Mary,” said her husband, “the folks that lost by Clark when the bank
broke have been at him until he 's felt obliged to pitch on somebody,
and he's pitched on me; and Captain Nourse has come to arrest me. I
shall get bail before long.”

She said nothing, and did not shed a tear till he was gone.

But then--




II.

Wide wastes of salt-marsh to the right, imprisoning the upland with a
vain promise of infinite liberty, and, between low, distant sandhills,
a rim of sea. Stretches of pine woods behind, shutting in from the great
outer world, and soon to darken into evening gloom. Ploughed fields and
elm-dotted pastures to the left, and birch-lined roads leading by white
farm-houses to the village, all speaking of cheer and freedom to the
prosperous and the happy, but to the unfortunate and the indebted, of
meshes invisible but strong as steel. But, before, no lonesome marshes,
no desolate forest, no farm or village street, but the free blue ocean,
rolling and tumbling still from the force of an expended gale.

In the open doorway of a little cottage, warmed by the soft slanting
rays of the September sun, a rough man, burnt and freckled, was sitting,
at his feet a net, engaged upon some handiwork which two little girls
were watching. Close by him lay a setter, his nose between his paws.
Occasionally the man raised his eyes to scan the sea.

“There's Joel,” he said, “comin' in around the Bar. Not much air
stirrin' now!”

Then he turned to his work again.

“First, you go _so_ fash',” he said to the children, as he drew a
thread; “then you go _so_ fash'.”

And as he worked he made a great show of labor, much to their diversion.

But the sight of Joel's broad white sail had not brought pleasant
thoughts to his mind; for Joel had hailed him, off the Shoal, the
afternoon before, and had obligingly offered to buy his fish right
there, and so let him go directly home, omitting to mention that sudden
jump of price due to an empty market.

“Wonder what poor man he 's took a dollar out of to-day! Well, I s'pose
it's all right: those that 's got money, want money.”

“What be you, Eli--ganging on hooks?” said Aunt Patience, as she tiptoed
into the kitchen behind him, from his wife's sick-room, and softly
closed the door after her.

“No,” said the elder of the children; “he 's mending our stockings, and
showing me how.”

“Well, you do have a hard time, don't you?” said Aunt Patience, looking
down over his shoulder; “to slave and tug and scrape to get a house over
your head, and then to have to turn square 'round, and stay to home with
a sick woman, and eat all into it with mortgages!”

“Oh, well,” he said, “we 'll fetch, somehow.”

Aunt Patience went to the glass, and holding a black pin in her mouth,
carefully tied the strings of her sun-bonnet.

“Anyway,” she says, “you take it good-natured. Though if there is one
thing that's harder than another, it is to be good-natured all the
time, without being aggravating. I have known men that was so awfully
good-natured that they was harder to live with than if they was cross!”

And without specifying further, she opened her plaid parasol and stepped
out at the porch.

Though, on this quiet afternoon of Saturday, the peace of the
approaching Sabbath seemed already brooding over the little dwelling,
peace had not lent her hand to the building of the home. Every foot of
land, every shingle, every nail, had been wrung from the reluctant sea.
Every voyage had contributed something. It was a great day when Eli was
able to buy the land. Then, between two voyages, he dug a cellar and
laid a foundation; then he saved enough to build the main part of the
cottage and to finish the front room, lending his own hand to the work.
Then he used to get letters at every port, telling of progress,--how
Lizzie, his wife, had adorned the front room with a bright ninepenny
paper, of which a little piece was enclosed,--which he kept as a sort
of charm about him and exhibited to his friends; how she and her little
brother had lathed the entry and the kitchen, and how they had set out
blackberry vines from the woods. Then another letter told of a surprise
awaiting him on his return; and, in due time, coming home as third mate
from Hong-Kong to a seaman's tumultuous welcome, he had found that a
great, good-natured mason, with whose sick child his wife had watched
night after night, had appeared one day with lime and hair and sand,
and in white raiment, and had plastered the entry and the kitchen, and
finished a room upstairs.

And so, for years, at home and on the sea, at New York and at Valparaiso
and in the Straits of Malacca, the little house and the little family
within it had grown into the fibre of Eli's heart. Nothing had given him
more delight than to meet, in the strange streets of Calcutta or before
the Mosque of Omar, some practical Yankee from Stonington or Machias,
and, whittling to discuss with him, among the turbans of the Orient,
the comparative value of shaved and of sawed shingles, or the economy
of “Swedes-iron” nails, and to go over with him the estimates and plans
which he had worked out in his head under all the constellations of the
skies.

The supper things were cleared away. The children had said good-night
and gone to bed, and Eli had been sitting for an hour by his wife's
bedside. He had had to tax his patience and ingenuity heavily during the
long months that she had lain there to entertain her for a little while
in the evening, after his hard, wet day's work. He had been talking now
of the coming week, when he was to serve upon the jury in the adjoining
county-town.

“I cal'late I can come home about every night,” he said, “and it 'll be
quite a change, at any rate.”

“But you don't seem so cheerful about it as I counted you would be,”
 said his wife. “Are you afraid you'll have to be on the bank case?”

“Not much!” he answered. “No trouble 'n that case! Jury won't leave
their seats. These city fellers 'll find they 've bit off more 'n they
can chew when they try to figure out John Wood done that. I only hope
I 'll have the luck to be on that case--all hands on the jury whisper
together a minute, and then clear him, right on the spot, and then shake
hands with him all 'round!”

“But something is worrying you,” she said. “What is it? You have looked
it since noon.”

“Oh, nothin',” he replied--“only George Cahoon came up to-noon to say
that he was goin' West next week, and that he would have to have that
money he let me have awhile ago. And where to get it--I don't know.”




III.

The court-room was packed. John Wood's trial was drawing to its close.
Eli was on the jury. Some one had advised the prosecuting attorney, in a
whisper, to challenge him, but he had shaken his head and said,--

“Oh, I could n't afford to challenge him for that; it would only leak
out, and set the jury against me. I 'll risk his standing out against
this evidence.”

The trial had been short. It had been shown how the little building
of the bank had been entered. Skilled locksmiths from the city had
testified that the safe was opened with a key, and that the lock was
broken afterward, from the inside, plainly to raise the theory of a
forcible entry by strangers.

It had been proved that the only key in existence, not counting that
kept by the president, was in the possession of Wood, who was filling,
for a few days, the place of the cashier--the president's brother--in
his absence. It had been shown that Wood was met, at one o'clock of
the night in question, crossing the fields toward his home, from
the direction of the bank, with a large wicker basket slung over his
shoulders, returning, as he had said, from eel-spearing in Harlow's
Creek; and there was other circumstantial evidence.

Mr. Clark, the president of the bank, had won the sympathy of every one
by the modest way in which, with his eye-glasses in his hand, he had
testified to the particulars of the loss which had left him penniless,
and had ruined others whose little all was in his hands. And then in
reply to the formal question, he had testified, amid roars of laughter
from the court-room, that it was not he who robbed the safe. At this,
even the judge and Wood's lawyer had not restrained a smile.

This had left the guilt with Wood. His lawyer, an inexperienced young
attorney,--who had done more or less business for the bank and would
hardly have ventured to defend this case but that the president had
kindly expressed his entire willingness that he should do so,--had, of
course, not thought it worth while to cross-examine Mr. Clark, and had
directed his whole argument against the theory that the safe had been
opened with a key, and not by strangers. But he had felt all through
that, as a man politely remarked to him when he finished, he was only
butting his “head ag'in a stone wall.”

And while he was arguing, a jolly-looking old lawyer had written, in
the fly-leaf of a law-book on his knee, and had passed with a wink to a
young man near him who had that very morning been admitted to the bar,
these lines:--

     “When callow Blackstones soar too high,
     Quit common-sense, and reckless fly,
     Soon, Icarus-like, they headlong fall,
     And down come client, case, and all.”

The district-attorney had not thought it worth while to expend much
strength upon his closing argument; but being a jovial stump-speaker, of
a wide reputation within narrow limits, he had not been able to refrain
from making merry over Wood's statement that the basket which he had
been seen bearing home, on the eventful night, was a basket of eels.

“Fine eels those, gentlemen! We have seen gold-fish and silver-fish, but
golden eels are first discovered by this defendant The apostle, in Holy
Writ, caught a fish with a coin in its mouth; but this man leaves the
apostle in the dim distance when he finds eels that are all money. No
storied fisherman of Bagdad, catching enchanted princes disguised as
fishes in the sea, ever hooked such a treasure as this defendant hooked
when he hooked that basket of eels! [Rustling appreciation of the jest
among the jury.] If a squirming, twisting, winding, wriggling eel,
gentlemen, can be said at any given moment to have a back, we may
distinguish this new-found species as the greenback eel. It is a common
saying that no man can hold an eel and remain a Christian. I should like
to have viewed the pious equanimity of this good man when he laid his
hands on that whole bed of eels. In happy, barefoot boyhood, gentlemen,
we used to find mud-turtles marked with initials or devices cut in their
shells; but what must have been our friend's surprise to find, in the
muddy bed of Harlow's Creek, eels marked with a steel-engraving of the
landing of Columbus and the signature of the Register of the Treasury! I
hear that a corporation is now being formed by the title of The Harlow's
Creek Greenback National Bank-bill Eel-fishing Company, to follow up,
with seines and spears, our worthy friend's discovery! I learn that the
news of this rich placer has spread to the golden mountains of the West,
and that the exhausted intellects which have been reduced to such names
for their mines as 'The Tombstone,' 'The Red Dog,' the 'Mrs. E. J.
Parkhurst,' are likely now to flood us with prospectuses of the 'Eel
Mine,' 'The Flat Eel,' 'The Double Eel,' and then, when they get ready
to burst upon confiding friends, 'The Consolidated Eels.'”

It takes but little to make a school or a court-room laugh, and the
speech had appeared to give a good deal of amusement to the listeners.

To all?

Did it amuse that man who sat, with folded arms, harsh and rigid, at
the dock? Did it divert that white-faced woman, cowering in a corner,
listening as in a dream?

The judge now charged the jury briefly. It was unnecessary for him,
he said, to recapitulate evidence of so simple a character. The chief
question for the jury was as to the credibility of the witnesses. If the
witnesses for the prosecution were truthful and were not mistaken, the
inference of guilt seemed inevitable; this the defendant's counsel had
conceded. The defendant had proved a good reputation; upon that point
there was only this to be said: that, while such evidence was entitled
to weight, yet, on the other hand, crimes involving a breach of trust
could, from their very nature, be committed only by persons whose good
reputations secured them positions of trust.

The jury-room had evidently not been furnished by a ring. It had a long
table for debate, twelve hard chairs for repose, twelve spittoons for
luxury, and a clock.

The jury sat in silence for a few moments, as old Captain Nourse, who
had them in his keeping, and eyed them as if he was afraid that he might
lose one of them in a crack and be held accountable on his bond, rattled
away at the unruly lock. Looking at them then, you would have seen faces
all of a New England cast but one. There was a tall, powerful negro
called George Washington, a man well known in this county town, to which
he had come, as driftwood from the storm of war, in '65. Some of the
“boys” had heard him, in a great prayer-meeting in Washington--a city
which he always spoke of as his “namesake”--at the time of the great
review, say, in his strong voice, with that pathetic quaver in it: “Like
as de parched an' weary traveller hangs his harp upon de winder, an'
sighs for oysters in de desert, so I longs to res' my soul an' my
foot in Mass'-chusetts;” and they were so delighted with him that they
invited him on the spot to go home with them, and took up a collection
to pay his fare; and so he was a public character. As for his
occupation,--when the census-taker, with a wink to the boys in the
store, had asked him what it was, he had said, in that same odd tone:
“Putties up glass a little--whitewashes a little--” and, when the man
had made a show of writing all that down, “preaches a little.” He might
have said, “preaches a big,” for you could hear him half a mile away.

The foreman was a retired sea-captain. “Good cap'n--Cap'n Thomas,” one
of his neighbors had said of him. “Allers gits good ships--never hez to
go huntin' 'round for a vessel. But it is astonishin' what differences
they is! Now there 's Cap'n A. K. P. Bassett, down to the West Harbor.
You let it git 'round that Cap'n A. K. P. is goin' off on a Chiny
voyage, and you 'll see half a dozen old shays to once-t, hitched all
along his fence of an arternoon, and wimmen inside the house, to git
Cap'n A. K. P. to take their boys. But you let Cap'n Thomas give out
that he wants boys, and he hez to glean 'em--from the poor-house, and
from step-mothers, and where he can: the women knows! Still,” he added,
“Cap'n Thomas 's a good cap'n. I've nothin' to say ag'in him. He's
smart!”

“Gentlemen,” said the foreman, when the officer, at last, had securely
locked them in, “shall we go through the formality of a ballot? If the
case were a less serious one, we might have rendered a verdict in our
seats.”

“What's the use foolin' 'round ballotin'?” said a thick-set butcher.
“Ain't we all o' one mind?”

“It is for you to say, gentlemen,” said the foreman. “I should n't want
to have it go abroad that we had not acted formally, if there was any
one disposed to cavil.”

“Mr. Speaker,” said George Washington, rising and standing in the
attitude of Webster, “I rises to appoint to order. We took ballast in de
prior cases, and why make flesh of one man an' a fowl of another?”

“Very well,” said the foreman, a trifle sharply; “'the longest way round
is the shortest way home.'”

Twelve slips of paper were handed out, to be indorsed guilty,
“for form.” They were collected in a hat and the foreman told them
over--“just for form.” “'Guilty,' 'guilty,' 'guilty,' 'guilty,'--wait a
minute,” he said, “here is a mistake. Here is one 'not guilty'--whose is
this?”

There was a pause.

“Whose is it?” said the foreman, sharply.

Eli turned a little red.

“It's mine,” he said.

“Do you mean it?” said the foreman.

“Of course I mean it,” he answered.

“Whew!” whistled the foreman. “Very well, sir; we'll have an
understanding, then. This case is proved to the satisfaction of every
man who heard it, I may safely say, but one. Will that one please state
the grounds of his opinion?”

“I ain't no talker,” said Eli, “but I ain't satisfied he 's
guilty--that's all.”

“Don't you believe the witnesses?”

“Mostly.”

“Which one don't you believe?”

“I can't say. I don't believe he's guilty.”

“Is there one that you think lied?”

No answer.

“Now it seems to me--” said a third juryman.

“One thing at a time, gentlemen,” said the foreman. “Let us wait for
an answer from Mr. Smith. Is there any one that you think lied? We will
wait, gentlemen, for an answer.”

There was a long pause. The trial seemed to Eli Smith to have shifted
from the court to this shabby room, and he was now the culprit.

All waited for him; all eyes were fixed upon him.

The clock ticked loud! Eli counted the seconds. He knew the
determination of the foreman.

The silence became intense.

“I want to say my say,” said a short man in a pea-jacket,--a retired
San Francisco pilot, named Eldridge. “I entertain no doubt the man is
guilty. At the same time, I allow for differences of opinion. I
don't know this man that's voted 'not guilty,' but he seems to be a
well-meaning man. I don't know his reasons; probably he don't understand
the case. I should like to have the foreman tell the evidence over, so
as if he don't see it clear, he can ask questions, and we can explain.”

“I second de motion,” said George Washington.

There was a general rustle of approval.

“I move it,” said the pilot, encouraged.

“Very well, Mr. Eldridge,” said the foreman. “If there is no objection,
I will state the evidence, and if there is any loop-hole, I will trouble
Mr. Smith to suggest it as I go along;” and he proceeded to give a
summary of the testimony, with homely force.

“Now, sir?” he said, when he had finished.

“I move for another ballot,” said Mr. Eldridge.

The result was the same. Eli had voted “not guilty.”

“Mr. Smith,” said the foreman, “this must be settled in some way. This
is no child's play. You can't keep eleven men here, trifling with them,
giving no pretence of a reason.”

“I have n't no reasons, only that I don't believe he 's guilty,” said
Eli. “I 'm not goin' to vote a man into State's-prison, when I don't
believe he done it,” and he rose and walked to the window and looked
out. It was low tide. There was a broad stretch of mud in the distance,
covered with boats lying over disconsolate. A driving storm had emptied
the streets. He beat upon the rain-dashed glass a moment with his
fingers, and then he sat down again.

“Well, sir,” said the foreman, “this is singular conduct. What do you
propose to do?”

Silence.

“I suppose you realize that the rest of us are pretty rapidly forming a
conclusion on this matter,” said the foreman.

“Come! come!” said Mr. Eldridge; “don't be quite so hard on him,
Captain. Now, Mr. Smith,” he said, standing up with his hands in his
coat-pockets and looking at Eli, “we know that there often is crooked
sticks on juries, that hold out alone--that's to be expected; but they
always argue, and stand to it the rest are fools, and all that. Now,
all is, we don't see why you don't sort of argue, if you 've got reasons
satisfactory to you. Come, now,” he added, walking up to Eli, and
resting one foot on the seat of his chair, “why don't you tell it over?
and if we 're wrong, I 'm ready to join you.”

Eli looked up at him.

“Did n't you ever know,” he said, “of a man's takin' a cat off, to lose,
that his little girl did n't want drownded, and leavin' him ashore,
twenty or thirty miles, bee-line, from home, and that cat's bein' back
again the next day, purrin' 'round 's if nothin' had happened?”

“Yes,” said Mr. Eldridge--“knew of just such a case.”

“Very well,” said Eli; “how does he find his way home?”

“Don't know,” said Mr. Eldridge; “always has been a standing mystery to
me.”

“Well,” said Eli, “mark my words. There's such a thing as arguin', and
there 's such a thing as knowin' outright; and when you 'll tell me
how that cat inquires his way home, I '11 tell you how I know John Wood
ain't guilty.”

This made a certain sensation, and Eli's stock went up.

An old, withered man rapped on the table.

“That's so!” he said; “and there's other sing'lar things! How is it that
a seafarin' man, that 's dyin' to home, will allers die on the ebbtide?
It never fails, but how does it happen? Tell me that! And there's more
ways than one of knowin' things, too!”

“I know that man ain't guilty,” said Eli.

“Hark ye!” said a dark old man with a troubled face, rising and pointing
his finger toward Eli. “_Know_, you say? I _knew_, wunst. I _knew_ that
my girl, my only child, was good. One night she went off with a married
man that worked in my store, and stole my money--and where is she now?”
 And then he added, “What I _know_ is, that every man hes his price. I
hev mine, and you hev yourn!”

“'Xcuse me, Mr. Speaker,” said George Washington, rising with his hand
in his bosom; “as de question is befo' us, I wish to say that de las'
bro' mus' have spoken under 'xcitement. Every man _don_' have his price!
An' I hope de bro' will recant--like as de Psalmist goes out o' his way
to say '_In my haste_ I said, All men are liars.' He was a very
busy man, de Psalmist--writin' down hymns all day, sharpen'n' his
lead-pencil, bossin' 'roun' de choir--callin' Selah! Well, bro'n an'
sisters “--both arms going out, and his voice going up--” one day,
seems like, he was in gre't haste--got to finish a psalm for a monthly
concert, or such--and some man in-corrupted him, and lied; and bein' in
gre't haste--and a little old Adam in him--he says, right off, quick:
'_All_ men are liars!' But see! When he gits a little time to set back
and meditate, he says: 'Dis won' do--dere's Moses an' Job, an' Paul--dey
ain't liars!' An' den he don' sneak out, and 'low he said, 'All men is
lions,' or such. No! de Psalmist ain't no such man; but he owns up, 'an
'xplains. '_In my haste_,' he says, 'I said it.'”

The foreman rose and rapped.

“I await a motion,” said he, “if our friend will allow me the privilege
of speaking.”

Mr. Washington calmly bowed.

Then the foreman, when nobody seemed disposed to move, speaking slowly
at first, and piecemeal, alternating language with smoke, gradually
edged into the current of the evidence, and ended by going all over it
again, with fresh force and point. His cigar glowed and chilled in the
darkening room as he talked.

“Now,” he said, when he had drawn all the threads together to the point
of guilt, “what are we going to do upon this evidence?”

“I 'll tell you something,” said Eli. “I did n't want to say it because
I know what you 'll all think, but I 'll tell you, all the same.”

“Ah!” said the foreman.

Eli stood up and faced the others.

“'Most all o' you know what our Bar is in a southeast gale. They ain't a
man here that would dare to try and cross it when the sea's breakin' on
it. The man that says he would, lies!” And he looked at the foreman, and
waited a moment.

“When my wife took sick, and I stopped goin' to sea, two year ago, and
took up boat-fishin', I did n't know half as much about the coast as the
young boys do, and one afternoon it was blowin' a gale, and we was all
hands comin' in, and passin' along the Bar to go sheer 'round it to the
west'ard, and Captain Fred Cook--he's short-sighted--got on to the Bar
before he knew it, and then he hed to go ahead, whether or no; and I was
right after him, and I s'posed he knew, and I followed him. Well, he was
floated over, as luck was, all right; but when I 'd just got on the Bar,
a roller dropped back and let my bowsprit down into the sand, and then
come up quicker'n lightnin' and shouldered the boat over, t' other end
first, and slung me into the water; and when I come up, I see somethin'
black, and there was John Wood's boat runnin' by me before the wind with
a rush--and 'fore I knew an'thing, he had me by the hair by one hand,
and in his boat, and we was over the Bar. Now, I tell you, a man that
looks the way I saw him look when I come over the gunwale, face up,
don't go 'round breakin' in and hookin' things. He hed n't one chance
in five, and he was a married man, too, with small children. And what's
more,” he added incautiously, “he did n't stop there. When he found out,
this last spring, that I was goin' to lose my place, he lent me money
enough to pay the interest that was overdue on the mortgage, of his own
accord.”

And he stopped suddenly.

“You have certainly explained yourself,” said the foreman. “I think we
understand you distinctly.”

“There is n't one word of truth in that idea,” said Eli, flushing up,
“and you know it. I 've paid him back every cent. I know him better 'n
any of you, that's all, and when I know he ain't guilty, I won't say he
is; and I can set here as long as any other man.”

“Lively times some folks 'll hev, when they go home,” said a spare
tin-pedler, stroking his long yellow goatee. “Go into the store: nobody
speak to you; go to cattle-show: everybody follow you 'round; go to the
wharf: nobody weigh your fish; go to buy seed-cakes to the cart: baker
won't give no tick.”

“How much does it cost, Mr. Foreman,” said the butcher, “for a man 't
's obliged to leave town, to move a family out West? I only ask for
information. I have known a case where a man had to leave--could n't
live there no longer--wa' n't wanted.”

There was a knock. An officer, sent by the judge, inquired whether the
jury were likely soon to agree.

“It rests with you, sir,” said the foreman, looking at Eli.

But Eli sat doggedly with his hands in his pockets, and did not look up
or speak.

“Say to the judge that I cannot tell,” said the foreman.

It was eight o'clock when the officer returned, with orders to take the
jury across the street to the hotel, to supper. They went out in pairs,
except that the juryman who was left to fall in with Eli made three
with the file ahead, and left Eli to walk alone. This was noticed by the
bystanders. At the hotel, Eli could not eat a mouthful. He was seated
at one end of the table, and was left entirely out of the conversation.
When the jury were escorted back to the courthouse, rumors had evidently
begun to arise from his having walked alone, for there was quite a
little crowd at the hotel door, to see them. They went as before: four
pairs, a file of three, and Eli alone. Then the spectators understood
it.

When the jury were locked into their room again for the night, Mr.
Eldridge sat down by Eli and lit his pipe.

“I understand,” he said, “just how you feel. Now, between you and me,
there was a good-hearted fellow that kept me out of a bad mess once. I
've never told anybody just what it was, and I don't mean to tell you
now, but it brought my blood up standing, to find how near I 'd come to
putting a fine steamer and two hundred and forty passengers under water.
Well, one day, a year or so after that, this man had a chance to get a
good ship, only there was some talk against him, that he drank a little.
Well, the owners told him they wanted to see me, and he come to me, and
says he, 'Mr. Eldridge, I hope you 'll speak a good word for me; if
you do, I 'll get the ship, but if they refuse me this one, I 'm dished
everywhere.' Well, the owners put me the square question, and I had to
tell 'em. Well, I met him that afternoon on Sacramento Street, as white
as a sheet, and he would n't speak to me, but passed right by, and that
night he went and shipped before the mast. That's the last I ever heard
of him; but I had to do it. Now,” he added, “this man 's been good to
you; but the case is proved, and you ought to vote with the rest of us.”

“It ain't proved,” said Eli. “The judge said that if any man had a
reasonable doubt, he ought to hold out. Now, I ain't convinced.”

“Well, that 's easy said,” replied Mr. Eldridge, a little hotly, and he
arose, and left him.

The jurymen broke up into little knots, tilted their chairs back, and
settled into the easiest positions that their cramped quarters allowed.
Most of them lit their pipes; the captain, and one or two whom he
honored, smoked fragrant cigars, and the room was soon filled with a
dense cloud.

Eli sat alone by the window.

“Sometimes sell two at one house,” said a lank book-agent, arousing
himself from a reverie; “once sold three.”

“I think the Early Rose is about as profitable as any,” said a little
farmer, with a large circular beard. “I used to favor Jacobs's Seedling,
but they have n't done so well with me of late years.”

“Sometimes,” said the book-agent, picking his teeth with a quill, “you
'll go to a house, and they 'll say they can't be induced to buy a book
of any kind, historical, fictitious, or religious; but you just keep on
talking, and show the pictures--'Grant in Boyhood,' 'Grant a Tanner,'
Grant at Head-quarters,' 'Grant in the White House,' 'Grant before Queen
Victoria,' and they warm up, I tell you, and not infrequently buy.”

“Do you sell de 'Illustrated Bible',” asked Washington, “wid de
Hypocrypha?”

“No; I have a more popular treatise--the 'Illustrated History of the
Bible.' Greater variety. Brings in the surrounding nations, in costume.
Cloth, three dollars; sheep, three-fifty; half calf, five-seventy-five;
full morocco, gilt edges, seven-fifty. Six hundred and seven
illustrations on wood and steel. Three different engravings of Abraham
alone. Four of Noah,--'Noah before the Flood,' 'Noah Building the
Ark,' 'Noah Welcoming the Dove,' 'Noah on Ararat,' Steel engraving of
Ezekiel's Wheel, explaining prophecy. Jonah under the gourd, Nineveh in
the distance.”

Mr. Eldridge and Captain Thomas had drifted into a discussion of
harbors, and the captain had drawn his chair up to the table, and, with
a cigar in his mouth, was explaining an ingeniously constructed foreign
harbor. He was making a rough sketch, with a pen.

“Here is north,” he said; “here is the coastline; here are the flats;
here are the sluicegates; they store the water here, in--”

Some of the younger men had their heads together, in a corner, about
the tin-pedler, who was telling stories of people he had met in his
journeys, which brought out repeated bursts of laughter.

In the corner farthest from Eli, a delicate-looking man began to tell
the butcher about Eli's wife.

“Twelve years ago this fall,” he said, “I taught district-school in the
parish where she lived. She was about fourteen then. Her father was
a poor farmer, without any faculty. Her mother was dead, and she kept
house. I stayed there one week, boarding 'round.”

“Prob'ly did n't git not much of any fresh meat that week,” suggested
the butcher.

“She never said much, but it used to divert me to see her order around
her big brothers, just as if she was their mother. She and I got to be
great friends; but she was a queer piece. One day at school the girls in
her row were communicating, and annoying me, while the third class
was reciting in 'First Steps in Numbers,' and I was so incensed that
I called Lizzie--that's her name--right out, and had her stand up for
twenty minutes. She was a shy little thing, and set great store by
perfect marks. I saw that she was troubled a good deal, to have all of
them looking and laughing at her. But she stood there, with her hands
folded behind her, and not a smile or a word.”

“Look out for a sullen cow,” said the butcher.

“I felt afraid I had been too hasty with her, and I was rather sorry I
had been so decided--although, to be sure, she did n't pretend to deny
that she had been communicating.”

“Of course,” said the butcher: “no use lyin' when you 're caught in the
act.”

“Well, after school, she stayed at her desk, fixing her dinner-pail, and
putting her books in a strap, and all that, till all the rest had gone,
and then she came up to my desk, where I was correcting compositions.”

“Now for music!” said the butcher.

“She had been crying a little. Well, she looked straight in my face, and
said she, 'Mr. Pollard, I just wanted to say to you that I was n't doing
anything at all when you called me up;' and off she went. Now, that was
just like her,--too proud to say a word before the school.”

But here his listener's attention was diverted by the voice of the
book-agent.

“The very best Bible for teachers, of course, is the limp-cover,
protected edges, full Levant morocco, Oxford, silk-sewed, kid-lined,
Bishop's Divinity Circuit, with concordance, maps of the Holy Land,
weights, measures, and money-tables of the Jews. Nothing like having a
really--”

“And so,” said the captain, moving back his chair, “they let on the
whole head of water, and scour out the channel to a T.”

And then he rapped upon the table.

“Gentlemen,” he said, “please draw your chairs up, and let us take
another ballot.”

The count resulted as before.

The foreman muttered something which had a scriptural sound. In a few
moments he drew Mr. Eldridge and two others aside. “Gentlemen,” he
said to them, “I shall quietly divide the jury into watches, under your
charge: ten can sleep, while one wakes to keep Mr. Smith discussing the
question. I don't propose to have the night wasted.”

And, by one man or another, Eli was kept awake.

“I don't see,” said the book-agent, “why you should feel obliged to
stick it out any longer. Of course, you are under obligations. But you
've done more than enough already, so as that he can't complain of you,
and if you give in now, everybody 'll give you credit for trying to save
your friend, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, for giving in to
the evidence. So you 'll get credit both ways.”

An hour later, the tin-pedler came on duty. He had not followed closely
the story about John Wood's loan, and had got it a little awry.

“Now, how foolish you be,” he said, in a confidential tone. “Can't
you see that if you cave in now, after stan'n' out nine hours”--and
he looked at a silver watch with a brass chain, and stroked his
goatee--“nine hours and twenty-seven minutes--that you 've made jest
rumpus enough so as't he won't dare to foreclose on you, for fear they
'll say you went back on a trade. On t' other hand, if you hold clear
out, he'll turn you out-o'-doors to-morrow, for a blind, so 's to look
as if there wa' n't no trade between you. Once he gits off, he won't
know Joseph, you bet! That's what I 'd do,” he added, with a sly laugh.
“Take your uncle's advice.”

“The only trouble with that,” said Eli, shortly, “is that I don't owe
him anything.”

“Oh,” said the pedler; “that makes a difference. I understood you did.”

Three o'clock came, and brought Mr. El-dridge. He found Eli worn out
with excitement.

“Now, I don't judge you the way the others do,” said Mr. Eldridge, in a
low tone, with his hand on Eli's knee. “I know, as I told you, just the
way you feel. But we can't help such things. Suppose, now, that I had
kept dark, and allowed to the owners that that man was always sober,
and I had heard, six months after, of thirty or forty men going to the
bottom because the captain was a little off his base; and then to think
of their wives and children at home. We have to do some hard things; but
I say, do the square thing, and let her slide.”

“But I can't believe he 's guilty,” said Eli.

“But don't you allow,” said Mr. Eldridge, “that eleven men are more sure
to hit it right than one man?”

“Yes,” said Eli, reluctantly, “as a general thing.”

“Well, there's always got to be some give to a jury, just as in
everything else, and you ought to lay right down on the rest of us. It
is n't as if we were at all squirmish. Now, you know that if you hold
out, he 'll be tried again.”

“Yes, I suppose so.”

“Got to be--no other way,” said Mr. Eldridge. “Now, the next time, there
won't be anybody like you to stand out, and the judge 'll know of this
scrape, and he'll just sock it to him.”

Eli turned uneasily in his chair.

“And then it won't be understood in your place, and folks 'll turn
against you every way, and, what's worse, let you alone.”

“I can stand it,” said Eli, angrily. “Let 'em do as they like. They
can't kill me.”

“They can kill your wife and break down your children,” said Mr.
Eldridge. “Women and children can't stand it. Now, there's that man they
were speaking of; he lived down my way. He sued a poor, shiftless fellow
that had come from Pennsylvania to his daughter's funeral, and had him
arrested and taken off, crying, just before the funeral begun--after
they 'd even set the flowers on the coffin; and nobody'd speak to him
after that--they just let him alone; and after a while his wife took
sick of it--she was a nice, kindly woman--and she had sort of hysterics,
and finally he moved off West. And 't was n't long before the woman
died. Now, you can't undertake to do different from everybody else.”

“Well,” said Eli, “I know I wish it was done with.”

Mr. Eldridge stretched his arms and yawned. Then he began to walk up and
down, and hum, out of tune. Then he stopped at Captain Thomas's chair.

“Suppose we try a ballot,” he said. “He seems to give a little.”

In a moment the foreman rapped.

“It is time we were taking another ballot, gentlemen,” he said.

The sleepers rose, grumbling, from uneasy dreams.

“I will write 'guilty' on twelve ballots,” said the foreman, “and if any
one desires to write in 'not,' of course he can.”

When the hat came to Eli, he took one of the ballots and held it in his
hand a moment, and then he laid it on the table. There was a general
murmur. The picture which Mr. El-dridge had drawn loomed up before him.
But with a hasty hand he wrote in “not,” dropped in the ballot, and
going back to his chair by the window, sat down.

There was a cold wave of silence.

Then Eli suddenly walked up to the foreman and faced him.

“Now,” he said, “we 'll stop. The very next turn breaks ground. If you,
or any other man that you set on, tries to talk to me when I don't want
to hear, to worry me to death--look out!”

How the long hours wore on! How easy, sometimes, to resist an open
pressure, and how hard, with the resistance gone, to fight, as one that
beats the air! How the prospect of a whole hostile town loomed up, in
a mirage, before Eli! And then the picture rose before him of a long,
stately bark, now building, whose owner had asked him yesterday to be
first mate. And if his wife were only well, and he were only free from
this night's trouble, how soon, upon the long, green waves, he could
begin to redeem his little home!

And then came Mr. Eldridge, kind and friendly, to have another little
chat.

Morning came, cold and drizzly. An officer knocked at the door, and
called out, “Breakfast!” And in a moment, unwashed, and all uncombed,
except the tin-pedler, who always carried a beard-comb in his pocket,
they were marched across the street to the hotel.

There were a number of men on the piazza waiting to see them,--jurymen,
witnesses, and the accused himself, for he was on bail. He had seen the
procession the night before, and, like the others, had read its meaning.

“Eli knows I would n't do it,” he had said to himself, “and he's going
to hang out, sure.”

The jury began to turn from the court-house door. Everybody looked. A
file of two men, another file, another, another; would there come three
men, and then one? No; Eli no longer walked alone.

Everybody looked at Wood; he turned sharply away.

But this time the order of march in fact showed nothing, one way or the
other. It only meant that the judge, who had happened to see the jury
the night before returning from their supper, had sent for the high
sheriff in some temper,--for judges are human,--and had vigorously
intimated that if that statesman did not look after his fool of a
deputy, who let a jury parade secrets to the public view, he would!

The jury were in their room again. At nine o'clock came a rap, and a
summons from the court. The prosecuting attorney was speaking with the
judge when they went in. In a moment he took his seat.

“John Wood!” called out the clerk, and the defendant arose. His attorney
was not there.

“Mr. Foreman!” said the judge, rising. The jury arose. The silence of
the crowded courtroom was intense.

“Before the clerk asks you for a verdict, gentlemen,” said the judge, “I
have something of the first importance to say to you, which has but this
moment come to my knowledge.”

Eli changed color, and the whole court-room looked at him.

“There were some most singular rumors, after the case was given to you,
gentlemen, to the effect that there had been in this cause a criminal
abuse of justice. It is painful to suspect, and shocking to know,
that courts and juries are liable ever to suffer by such unprincipled
practices. After ten years upon the bench, I never witness a conviction
of crime without pain; but that pain is light, compared with the
distress of knowing of a wilful perversion of justice. It is a relief
to me to be able to say to you that such instances are, in my judgment,
exceedingly rare, and--so keen is the awful searching power of
truth--are almost invariably discovered.”

The foreman touched his neighbor with his elbow. Eli folded his arms.

“As I said,” continued the judge, “there were most singular rumors.
During the evening and the night, rumor, as is often the case, led to
evidence, and evidence has led to confession and to certainty. And the
district attorney now desires me to say to you that the chief officer of
the bank--who held the second key to the safe--is now under arrest for a
heavy defalcation, which a sham robbery was to conceal, and that you may
find the prisoner at the bar--not guilty. I congratulate you, gentlemen,
that you had not rendered an adverse verdict.”

“Your Honor!” said Eli, and he cleared his throat, “I desire it to be
known that, even as the case stood last night, this jury had not agreed
to convict, and never would have!”

There was a hush, while a loud scratching pen indorsed the record of
acquittal. Then Wood walked down to the jury-box and took Eli's hand.

“Just what I told my wife all through,” he said. “I knew you 'd hang
out!”

Eli's jury was excused for the rest the of day, and by noon he was in
his own village, relieved, too, of his most pressing burden: for George
Cahoon had met him on the road, and told him that he was not going to
the West, after all, for the present, and should not need his money.
But, as he turned the bend of the road and neared his house, he felt a
rising fear that some disturbing rumor might have reached his wife about
his action on the jury. And, to his distress and amazement, there she
was, sitting in a chair at the door.

“Lizzie!” he said, “what does this mean? Are you crazy?”

“I'll tell you what it means,” she said, as she stood up with a little
smile and clasped her hands behind her. “This morning it got around and
came to me that you was standing out all alone for John Wood, and that
the talk was that they 'd be down on you, and drive you out of town,
and that everybody pitied _me_,--_pitied me!_ And when I heard that,
I thought I 'd see! And my strength seemed to come all back, and I got
right up and dressed myself. And what's more, I 'm going to get well
now!”

And she did.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Once upon a time in Colorado lived a man named Abednego Danner and his
wife, Matilda. Abednego Danner was a professor of biology in a small
college in the town of Indian Creek. He was a spindling wisp of a man,
with a nature drawn well into itself by the assaults of the world and
particularly of the grim Mrs. Danner, who understood nothing and
undertook all. Nevertheless these two lived modestly in a frame house on
the hem of Indian Creek and they appeared to be a settled and peaceful
couple.

The chief obstacle to Mrs. Danner's placid dominion of her hearth was
Professor Danner's laboratory, which occupied a room on the first floor
of the house. It was the one impregnable redoubt in her domestic
stronghold. Neither threat nor entreaty would drive him and what she
termed his ""stinking, unchristian, unhealthy dinguses"" from that room.
After he had lectured vaguely to his classes on the structure of the
_Paramecium caudatum_ and the law discovered by Mendel, he would shut
the door behind himself, and all the fury of the stalwart, black-haired
woman could not drive him out until his own obscure ends were served.

It never occurred to Professor Danner that he was a great man or a
genius. His alarm at such a notion would have been pathetic. He was so
fascinated by the trend of his thoughts and experiments, in fact, that
he scarcely realized by what degrees he had outstripped a world that
wore picture hats, hobble skirts, and straps beneath its trouser legs.
However, as the century turned and the fashions changed, he was carried
further from them, which was just as well.

On a certain Sunday he sat beside his wife in church, singing snatches
of the hymns in a doleful and untrue voice and meditating, during the
long sermon, on the structure of chromosomes. She, bolt upright and
overshadowing him, like a coffin in the pew, rigid lest her black silk
rustle, thrilled in some corner of her mind at the picture of hell and
salvation.

Mr. Danner's thoughts turned to Professor Mudge, whose barren pate
showed above the congregation a few rows ahead of him. There, he said to
himself, sat a stubborn and unenlightened man. And so, when the weekly
tyranny of church was ended, he asked Mudge to dinner. That he
accomplished by an argument with his wife, audible the length of the
aisle.

They walked to the Danner residence. Mrs. Danner changed her clothes
hurriedly, basted the roast, made milk sauce for the string beans, and
set three places. They went into the dining-room. Danner carved, the
home-made mint jelly was passed, the bread, the butter, the gravy; and
Mrs. Danner dropped out of the conversation, after guying her husband on
his lack of skill at his task of carving.

Mudge opened with the usual comment. ""Well, Abednego, how are the
blood-stream radicals progressing?""

His host chuckled. ""Excellently, thanks. Some day I'll be ready to jolt
you hidebound biologists into your senses.""

Mudge's left eyebrow lifted. ""So? Still the same thing, I take it? Still
believe that chemistry controls human destiny?""

""Almost ready to demonstrate it,"" Danner replied.

""Along what lines?""

""Muscular strength and the nervous discharge of energy.""

Mudge slapped his thigh. ""Ho ho! Nervous discharge of energy. You assume
the human body to be a voltaic pile, eh? That's good. I'll have to tell
Gropper. He'll enjoy it.""

Danner, in some embarrassment, gulped a huge mouthful of meat. ""Why
not?"" he said. ""Look at the insects--the ants. Strength a hundred times
our own. An ant can carry a large spider--yet an ant is tissue and
fiber, like a man. If a man could be given the same sinews--he could
walk off with his own house.""

""Ha ha! There's a good one. Maybe you'll do it, Abednego.""

""Possibly, possibly.""

""And you would make a splendid piano-mover.""

""Pianos! Pooh! Consider the grasshoppers. Make a man as strong as a
grasshopper--and he'll be able to leap over a church. I tell you, there
is something that determines the quality of every muscle and nerve. Find
it--transplant it--and you have the solution.""

Mirth overtook Professor Mudge in a series of paroxysms from which he
emerged rubicund and witty. ""Probably your grasshopper man will look
like a grasshopper--more insect than man. At least, Danner, you have
imagination.""

""Few people have,"" Danner said, and considered that he had acquitted
himself.

His wife interrupted at that point. ""I think this nonsense has gone far
enough. It is wicked to tamper with God's creatures. It is wicked to
discuss such matters--especially on the Sabbath. Abednego, I wish you
would give up your work in the laboratory.""

Danner's cranium was overlarge and his neck small; but he stiffened it
to hold himself in a posture of dignity. ""Never.""

His wife gazed from the defiant pose to the locked door visible through
the parlour. She stirred angrily in her clothes and speared a morsel of
food. ""You'll be punished for it.""

Later in the day Mudge and Gropper laughed heartily at the expense of
the former's erstwhile host. Danner read restively. He was forbidden to
work on the Sabbath. It was his only compromise. Matilda Danner turned
the leaves of the Bible and meditated in a partial vacuum of day-dreams.

On Monday Danner hastened home from his classes. During the night he had
had a new idea. And a new idea was a rare thing after fourteen years of
groping investigation. ""Alkaline radicals,"" he murmured as he crossed
his lawn. He considered a group of ultra-microscopic bodies. He had no
name for them. They were the ""determinants"" of which he had talked. He
locked the laboratory door behind himself and bent over the microscope
he had designed. ""Huh!"" he said. An hour later, while he stirred a
solution in a beaker, he said: ""Huh!"" again. He repeated it when his
wife called him to dinner. The room was a maze of test tubes, bottles,
burners, retorts, instruments. During the meal he did not speak.
Afterwards he resumed work. At twelve he prepared six tadpole eggs and
put them to hatch. It would be his three hundred and sixty-first
separate tadpole hatching.

Then, one day in June, Danner crossed the campus with unusual haste.
Birds were singing, a gentle wind eddied over the town from the slopes
of the Rocky Mountains, flowers bloomed. The professor did not heed the
reburgeoning of nature. A strange thing had happened to him that
morning. He had peeped into his workroom before leaving for the college
and had come suddenly upon a phenomenon.

One of the tadpoles had hatched in its aquarium. He observed it eagerly,
first because it embodied his new idea, and second because it swam with
a rare activity. As he looked, the tadpole rushed at the side of its
domicile. There was a tinkle and a splash. It had swum through the plate
glass! For an instant it lay on the floor. Then, with a flick of its
tail, it flew into the air and hit the ceiling of the room.

""Good Lord!"" Danner said. Old years of work were at an end. New years of
excitement lay ahead. He snatched the creature and it wriggled from his
grasp. He caught it again. His fist was not sufficiently strong to hold
it. He left it, flopping in eight-foot leaps, and went to class with
considerable suppressed agitation and some reluctance. The determinant
was known. He had made a living creature abnormally strong.

When he reached his house and unlocked the door of the laboratory, he
found that four tadpoles, in all, had hatched. Before they expired in
the unfamiliar element of air, they had demolished a quantity of
apparatus.

Mrs. Danner knocked on the door. ""What's been going on in there?""

""Nothing,"" her husband answered.

""Nothing! It sounded like nothing! What have you got there? A cat?""

""No--yes.""

""Well--I won't have such goings on, and that's all there is to it.""

Danner collected the débris. He buried the tadpoles. One was dissected
first. Then he wrote for a long time in his notebook. After that he went
out and, with some difficulty, secured a pregnant cat. A week later he
chloroformed the tabby and inoculated her. Then he waited. He had been
patient for a long time. It was difficult to be patient now.

When the kittens were born into this dark and dreary world, Mr. Danner
assisted as sole obstetrician. In their first hours nothing marked them
as unique. The professor selected one and drowned the remainder. He
remembered the tadpoles and made a simple calculation.

When the kitten was two weeks old and its eyes opened, it was dieting on
all its mother's milk and more besides. The professor considered that
fact significant. Then one day it committed matricide.

Probably the playful blow of its front paw was intended in the best
spirit. Certainly the old tabby, receiving it, was not prepared for such
violence from its offspring. Danner gasped. The kitten had unseamed its
mother in a swift and horrid manner. He put the cat out of its misery
and tended the kitten with trepidation. It grew. It ate--beefsteaks and
chops, bone and all.

When it reached three weeks, it began to jump alarmingly. The laboratory
was not large enough. The professor brought it its food with the
expression of a man offering a wax sausage to a hungry panther.

On a peaceful Friday evening Danner built a fire to stave off the
rigours of a cold snap. He and Mrs. Danner sat beside the friendly
blaze. Her sewing was in her lap, and in his was a book to which he paid
scant attention. The kitten, behind its locked door, thumped and mewed.

""It's hungry,"" Mrs. Danner said. ""If you must keep a cat, why don't you
feed it?""

""I do,"" he answered. He refrained, for politic reasons, from mentioning
what and how much he fed it. The kitten mewed again.

""Well,"" she repeated, ""it sounds hungry.""

Danner fidgeted. The laboratory was unheated and consequently chilly.
From its gloomy interior the kitten peered beneath the door and saw the
fire. It sensed warmth. The feline affinity for hearths drew it. One paw
scratched tentatively on the door.

""It's cold,"" Mrs. Danner said. ""Why don't you bring it here? No, I don't
want it here. Take it a cover.""

""It--it has a cover."" Danner did not wish to go into that dark room.

The kitten scratched again and then it became earnest. There was a
splitting, rending sound. The bottom panel of the door was torn away and
it emerged nonchalantly, crossing the room and curling up by the fire.

For five minutes Mrs. Danner sat motionless. Her eyes at length moved
from the kitten to her husband's quivering face and then to the broken
door. On his part, he made no move. The kitten was a scant six inches
from his foot. Mrs. Danner rose. She went to the door and studied the
orifice, prying at it with her fingers as if to measure the kitten's
strength by her own. Then she turned the key and peered into the gloom.
That required either consummate nerve or great curiosity. After her
inspection she sat down again.

Ten minutes passed. Danner cleared his throat. Then she spoke. ""So.
You've done it?""

""Done what?"" he asked innocently.

""You've made all this rubbish you've been talking about strength--happen
to that kitten.""

""It wasn't rubbish.""

""Evidently.""

At that crisis Mr. Danner's toe trembled and the kitten, believing it a
new toy, curled its paws over the shoe. There was a sound of tearing
leather, and the shoe came apart. Fortunately the foot inside it was not
hurt severely. Danner did not dare to budge. He heard his wife's
startled inhalation.

Mrs. Danner did not resume her sewing. She breathed heavily and slow
fire crept into her cheeks. The enormity of the crime overcame her. And
she perceived that the hateful laboratory had invaded her portion of
the house. Moreover, her sturdy religion had been desecrated. Danner
read her thoughts.

""Don't be angry,"" he said. Beads of perspiration gathered on his brow.

""Angry!"" The kitten stirred at the sound of her voice. ""Angry! And why
not? Here you defied God and man--and made that creature of the devil.
You've overrun my house. You're a wicked, wicked man. And as for that
cat, I won't have it. I won't stand for it.""

""What are you going to do?""

Her voice rose to a scream. ""Do! Do! Plenty--and right here and now.""
She ran to the kitchen and came back with a broom. She flung the front
door wide. Her blazing eyes rested for a moment on the kitten. To her it
had become merely an obnoxious little animal. ""Scat! You little demon!""
The broom came down on the cat's back with a jarring thud.

After that, chaos. A ball of fur lashed through the air. What-not, bird
cage, bookcase, morris chair flew asunder. Then the light went out. In
the darkness a comet, a hurricane, ricochetted through the room. Then
there was a crash mightier than the others, followed by silence.

When Danner was able, he picked himself up and lighted the lamp. His
wife lay on the floor in a dead faint. He revived her. She sat up and
wept silently over the wreck of her parlour. Danner paled. A round
hole--a hole that could have been made by nothing but a solid cannon
shot--showed where the kitten had left the room through the wall.

Mrs. Danner's eyes were red-rimmed. Her breath came jerkily. With
incredulous little gestures she picked herself up and gazed at the hole.
A draught blew through it. Mr. Danner stuffed it with a rug.

""What are we going to do?"" she said.

""If it comes back--we'll call it Samson.""

And--as soon as Samson felt the gnawing of appetite, he returned to his
rightful premises. Mrs. Danner fed him. Her face was pale and her hands
trembled. Horror and fascination fought with each other in her soul as
she offered the food. Her husband was in his classroom, nervously trying
to fix his wits on the subject of the day.

""Kitty, kitty, poor little kitty,"" she said.

Samson purred and drank a quart of milk. She concealed her astonishment
from herself. Mrs. Danner's universe was undergoing a transformation.

At three in the afternoon the kitten scratched away the screen door on
the back porch and entered the house. Mrs. Danner fed it the supper
meat.

Danner saw it when he returned. It was chasing flies in the yard. He
stood in awe. The cat could spring twenty or thirty feet with ease. Then
the sharp spur of dread entered him. Suppose someone saw and asked
questions. He might be arrested, taken to prison. Something would
happen. He tried to analyze and solve the problem. Night came. The cat
was allowed to go out unmolested. In the morning the town of Indian
Creek rose to find that six large dogs had been slain during the dark
hours. A panther had come down from the mountains, they said. And Danner
lectured with a dry tongue and errant mind.

It was Will Hoag, farmer of the fifth generation, resident of the
environs of Indian Creek, church-goer, and hard-cider addict, who bent
himself most mercilessly on the capture of the alleged panther. His
chicken-house suffered thrice and then his sheep-fold. After four such
depredations he cleaned his rifle and undertook a vigil from a spot
behind the barn. An old moon rose late and illuminated his pastures with
a blue glow. He drank occasionally from a jug to ward off the evil
effects of the night air.

Some time after twelve his attention was distracted from the jug by
stealthy sounds. He moved toward them. A hundred yards away his cows
were huddled together--a heap of dun shadows. He saw a form which he
mistook for a weasel creeping toward the cows. As he watched, he
perceived that the small animal behaved singularly unlike a weasel. It
slid across the earth on taut limbs, as if it was going to attack the
cows. Will Hoag repressed a guffaw.

Then the farmer's short hair bristled. The cat sprang and landed on the
neck of the nearest cow and clung there. Its paw descended. There was a
horrid sound of ripping flesh, a moan, the thrashing of hoofs, a blot
of dribbling blood, and the cat began to gorge on its prey.

Hoag believed that he was intoxicated, that delirium tremens had
overtaken him. He stood rooted to the spot. The marauder ignored him.
Slowly, unbelievingly, he raised his rifle and fired. The bullet knocked
the cat from its perch. Mr. Hoag went forward and picked it up.

""God Almighty,"" he whispered. The bullet had not penetrated the cat's
skin. And, suddenly, it wriggled in his hand. He dropped it. A flash of
fur in the moonlight, and he was alone with the corpse of his Holstein.

He contemplated profanity, he considered kneeling in prayer. His joints
turned to water. He called faintly for his family. He fell unconscious.

When Danner heard of that exploit--it was relayed by jeering tongues who
said the farmer was drunk and a panther had killed the cow--his lips set
in a line of resolve. Samson was taking too great liberties. It might
attack a person, in which case he, Danner, would be guilty of murder.
That day he did not attend his classes. Instead, he prepared a
relentless poison in his laboratory and fed it to the kitten in a brace
of meaty chops. The dying agonies of Samson, aged seven weeks, were
Homeric.

After that, Danner did nothing for some days. He wondered if his formulæ
and processes should be given to the world. But, being primarily a man
of vast imagination, he foresaw hundreds of rash experiments. Suppose,
he thought, that his discovery was tried on a lion, or an elephant! Such
a creature would be invincible. The tadpoles were dead. The kitten had
been buried. He sighed wearily and turned his life into its usual
courses.




II


Before the summer was ended, however, a new twist of his life and
affairs started the mechanism of the professor's imagination again. It
was announced to him when he returned from summer school on a hot
afternoon. He dropped his portfolio on the parlour desk, one corner of
which still showed the claw-marks of the miscreant Samson, and sat down
with a comfortable sigh.

""Abednego."" His wife seldom addressed him by his first name.

""Yes?""

""I--I--I want to tell you something.""

""Yes?""

""Haven't you noticed any difference in me lately?""

He had never noticed a difference in his wife. When they reached old
age, he would still be unable to discern it. He shook his head and
looked at her with some apprehension. She was troubled. ""What's the
matter?""

""I suppose you wouldn't--yet,"" she said. ""But--well--I'm with child.""

The professor folded his upper lip between his thumb and forefinger.
""With child? Pregnant? You mean--""

""I'm going to have a baby.""

Soon after their marriage the timid notion of parenthood had escaped
them. They had, in fact, avoided its mechanics except on those rare
evenings when tranquillity and the reproductive urge conspired to imbue
him with courage and her with sinfulness. Nothing came of that
infrequent union. They never expected anything.

And now they were faced with it. He murmured: ""A baby.""

Faint annoyance moved her. ""Yes. That's what one has. What are we going
to do?""

""I don't know, Matilda. But I'm glad.""

She softened. ""So am I, Abednego.""

Then a hissing, spattering sound issued from the kitchen. ""The beans!""
Mrs. Danner said. The second idyl of their lives was finished.

Alone in his bed, tossing on the humid muslin sheets, Danner struggled
within himself. The hour that was at hand would be short. The logical
step after the tadpoles and the kitten was to vaccinate the human mammal
with his serum. To produce a super-child, an invulnerable man. As a
scientist he was passionately intrigued by the idea. As a husband he
was dubious. As a member of society he was terrified.

That his wife would submit to the plan or to the step it necessitated
was beyond belief. She would never allow a sticky tube of foreign animal
matter to be poured into her veins. She would not permit the will of God
to be altered or her offspring to be the subject of experiment. Another
man would have laughed at the notion of persuading her. Mr. Danner never
laughed at matters that involved his wife.

There was another danger. If the child was female and became a woman
like his wife, then the effect of such strength would be awful indeed.
He envisioned a militant reformer, an iron-bound Calvinist, remodelling
the world single-handed. A Scotch Lilith, a matronly Gabriel, a
she-Hercules. He shuddered.

A hundred times he denied his science. A hundred and one times it begged
him to be served. Each decision to drop the idea was followed by an
effort to discover means to inoculate her without her knowledge. To his
wakeful ears came the reverberation of her snores. He rose and paced the
floor. A scheme came to him. After that he was lost.

Mrs. Danner was surprised when her husband brought a bottle of
blackberry cordial to her. It was his first gift to her in more than a
year. She was fond of cordial. He was not. She took a glass after supper
and then a second, which she drank ""for him."" He smiled nervously and
urged her to drink it. His hands clenched and unclenched. When she
finished the second glass, he watched her constantly.

""I feel sleepy,"" she said.

""You're tired."" He tried to dissemble the eagerness in his voice. ""Why
don't you lie down?""

""Strange,"" she said a moment later. ""I'm not usually so--so--misty.""

He nodded. The opiate in the cordial was working. She lay on the couch.
She slept. The professor hastened to his laboratory. An hour later he
emerged with a hypodermic syringe in his hand. His wife lay limply, one
hand touching the floor. Her stern, dark face was relaxed. He sat beside
her. His conscience raged. He hated the duplicity his task required. His
eyes lingered on the swollen abdomen. It was cryptic, enigmatic, filled
with portent. He jabbed the needle. She did not stir. After that he
substituted a partly empty bottle of cordial for the drugged liquor. It
was, perhaps, the most practical thing he had ever done in his life.

Mrs. Danner could not explain herself on the following morning. She
belaboured him. ""Why didn't you wake me and make me go to bed? Sleeping
in my clothes! I never did such a thing in my life.""

""I couldn't wake you. I tried.""

""Rubbish.""

""You were sleeping so hard--you refused to move.""

""Sometimes, old as you are, I'd like to thrash you.""

Danner went to the college. There was nothing more to do, nothing more
to require his concentration. He could wait--as he had waited before. He
trembled occasionally with the hope that his child would be a boy--a
sane, healthy boy. Then, in the end, his work might bear fruit. ""The
_Euglena viridis_,"" he said in flat tones, ""will be the subject of
to-morrow's study. I want you gentlemen to diagram the structure of the
_Euglena viridis_ and write five hundred words on its vital principles
and processes. It is particularly interesting because it shares
properties that are animal with properties that are vegetable.""

September, October, November. Chilly winds from the high mountains. The
day-by-day freezing over of ponds and brooks. Smoke at the tops of
chimneys. Snow. Thanksgiving. And always Mrs. Danner growing with the
burden of her offspring. Mr. Danner sitting silent, watching, wondering,
waiting. It would soon be time.

On Christmas morning there entered into Mrs. Danner's vitals a pain that
was indefinable and at the same time certain. It thrust all thought from
her mind. Then it diminished and she summoned her husband. ""Get the
doctor. It's coming.""

Danner tottered into the street and executed his errand. The doctor
smiled cheerfully. ""Just beginning? I'll be over this afternoon.""

""But--good Lord--you can't leave her like--""

""Nonsense.""

He came home and found his wife dusting. He shook his head. ""Get Mrs.
Nolan,"" she said. Then she threw herself on the bed again.

Mrs. Nolan, the nearest neighbour, wife of Professor Nolan and mother of
four children, was delighted. This particular Christmas was going to be
a day of some excitement. She prepared hot water and bustled with
unessential occupation. Danner sat prostrate in the parlour. He had done
it. He had done more--and that would be known later. Perhaps it would
fail. He hoped it would fail. He wrung his hands. The concept of another
person in his house had not yet occurred to him. Birth was his wife's
sickness--until it was over.

The doctor arrived after Danner had made his third trip. Mrs. Nolan
prepared lunch. ""I love to cook in other people's kitchens,"" she said.
He wanted to strike her. Curious, he thought. At three-thirty the
industry of the doctor and Mrs. Nolan increased and the silence of the
two, paradoxically, increased with it.

Then the early twilight fell. Mrs. Danner lay with her lank black
hair plastered to her brow. She did not moan. Pain twisted and
convulsed her. Downstairs Danner sat and sweated. A cry--his wife's.
Another--unfamiliar. Scurrying feet on the bare parts of the floor. He
looked up. Mrs. Nolan leaned over the stair well.

""It's a boy, Mr. Danner. A beautiful boy. And husky. You never saw such
a husky baby.""

""It ought to be,"" he said. They found him later in the back yard,
prancing on the snow with weird, ungainly steps. A vacant smile lighted
his features. They didn't blame him.




III


Calm and quiet held their negative sway over the Danner ménage for an
hour, and then there was a disturbed fretting that developed into a
lusty bawl. The professor passed a fatigued hand over his brow. He was
unaccustomed to the dissonances of his offspring. Young Hugo--they had
named him after a maternal uncle--had attained the age of one week
without giving any indication of unnaturalness.

That is not quite true. He was as fleshy as most healthy infants, but
the flesh was more than normally firm. He was inordinately active. His
eyes had been gray but, already, they gave promise of the inkiness they
afterwards exhibited. He was born with a quantity of black hair--hair so
dark as to be nearly blue. Abednego Danner, on seeing it, exercised the
liberty which all husbands take, and investigated rumours of his wife's
forbears with his most secret thoughts. The principal rumour was that
one of her lusty Covenanter grandsires had been intrigued by a squaw to
the point of forgetting his Psalms and recalling only the Song of
Solomon.

However that may have been, Hugo was an attractive and virile baby.
Danner spent hours at the side of his crib speculating and watching for
any sign of biological variation. But it was not until a week had passed
that he was given evidence. By that time he was ready to concede the
failure of his greatest experiment.

The baby bawled and presently stopped. And Mrs. Danner, who had put it
to breast, suddenly called her husband. ""Abednego! Come here! Hurry!""

The professor's heart skipped its regular timing and he scrambled to the
floor above. ""What's the matter?""

Mrs. Danner was sitting in a rocking-chair. Her face was as white as
paper. Only in her eyes was there a spark of life. He thought she was
going to faint. ""What's the matter?"" he said again.

He looked at Hugo and saw nothing terrifying in the ravishing hunger
which the infant showed.

""Matter! Matter! You know the matter!""

Then he knew and he realized that his wife had discovered. ""I don't. You
look frightened. Shall I bring some water?""

Mrs. Danner spoke again. Her voice was icy, distant, terrible. ""I came
in to feed him just a minute ago. He was lying in his crib. I tried
to--to hug him and he put his arms out. As God lives, I could not pull
that baby to me! He was too strong, Abednego! Too strong. Too strong. I
couldn't unbend his little arms when he stiffened them. I couldn't
straighten them when he bent them. And he pushed me--harder than you
could push. Harder than I could push myself. I know what it means. You
have done your horrible thing to my baby. He's just a baby, Abednego.
And you've done your thing to him. How could you? Oh, how could you!""

Mrs. Danner rose and laid the baby gently on the chair. She stood before
her husband, towering over him, raised her hand, and struck with all her
force. Mr. Danner fell to one knee, and a red welt lifted on his face.
She struck him again and he fell against the chair. Little Hugo was
dislodged. One hand caught a rung of the chair back and he hung
suspended above the floor.

""Look!"" Mrs. Danner screamed.

As they looked, the baby flexed its arm and lifted itself back into the
chair. It was a feat that a gymnast would have accomplished with
difficulty. Danner stared, ignoring the blows, the crimson on his cheek.
For once in his lifetime, he suddenly defied his wife. He pointed to the
child.

""Yes, look!"" His voice rang clearly. ""I did it. I vaccinated you the
night the cordial put you to sleep. And there's my son. He's strong.
Stronger than a lion's cub. And he'll increase in strength as he grows
until Samson and Hercules would be pygmies beside him. He'll be the
first of a new and glorious race. A race that doesn't have to
fear--because it cannot know harm. No man can hurt him, no man can
vanquish him. He will be mightier than any circumstances. He, son of a
weak man, will be stronger than the beasts, even than the ancient
dinosaurs, stronger than the tides, stronger than fate--strong as God is
strong. And you--you, Matilda--mother of him, will be proud of him. He
will be great and famous. You can knock me down. You can knock me down a
thousand times. I have given you a son whose little finger you cannot
bend with a crow-bar. Oh, all these years I've listened to you and
obeyed you and--yes, I've feared you a little--and God must hate me for
it. Now take your son. And my son. You cannot change him. You cannot
bend him to your will. He is all I might have been. All that mankind
should be."" Danner's voice broke and he sobbed. He relented. ""I know
it's hard for you. It's against your religion--against your love, even.
But try to like him. He's no different from you and me--only stronger.
And strength is a glorious thing, a great thing. Then--afterwards--if
you can--forgive me."" He collapsed.

Blood pounded in her ears. She stared at the huddled body of her
husband. He had stood like a prophet and spoken words of fire. She was
shaken from her pettiness. For one moment she had loved Danner. In that
same instant she had glimpsed the superhuman energy that had driven him
through the long years of discouragement to triumph. She had seen his
soul. She fell at his feet, and when Danner opened his eyes, he found
her there, weeping. He took her in his arms, timidly, clumsily. ""Don't
cry, Mattie. It'll be all right. You love him, don't you?""

She stared at the babe. ""Of course I love him. Wash your face,
Abednego.""

After that there was peace in the house, and with it the child grew.
During the next months they ignored his peculiarities. When they found
him hanging outside his crib, they put him back gently. When he smashed
the crib, they discussed a better place for him to repose. No hysteria,
no conflict. When, in the early spring, young Hugo began to recognize
them and to assert his feelings, they rejoiced as all parents rejoice.

When he managed to vault the sill of the second-story window by some
antic contortion of his limbs, they dismissed the episode. Mrs. Danner
had been baking. She heard the child's voice and it seemed to come from
the yard. Startled, incredulous, she rushed upstairs. Hugo was not in
his room. His wail drifted through the window. She looked out. He was
lying in the yard, fifteen feet below. She rushed to his side. He had
not been hurt.

Danner made a pen of the iron heads and feet of two old beds. He wired
them together. The baby was kept in the inclosure thus formed. The days
warmed and lengthened. No one except the Danners knew of the prodigy
harboured by their unostentatious house. But the secret was certain to
leak out eventually.

Mrs. Nolan, the next-door neighbour, was first to learn it. She had
called on Mrs. Danner to borrow a cup of sugar. The call, naturally,
included a discussion of various domestic matters and a visit to the
baby. She voiced a question that had occupied her mind for some time.

""Why do you keep the child in that iron thing? Aren't you afraid it will
hurt itself?""

""Oh, no.""

Mrs. Nolan viewed young Hugo. He was lying on a large pillow. Presently
he rolled off its surface. ""Active youngster, isn't he?""

""Very,"" Mrs. Danner said, nervously.

Hugo, as if he understood and desired to demonstrate, seized a corner of
the pillow and flung it from him. It traversed a long arc and landed on
the floor. Mrs. Nolan was startled. ""Goodness! I never saw a child his
age that could do that!""

""No. Let's go downstairs. I want to show you some tidies I'm making.""

Mrs. Nolan paid no attention. She put the pillow back in the pen and
watched while Hugo tossed it out. ""There's something funny about that.
It isn't normal. Have you seen a doctor?""

Mrs. Danner fidgeted. ""Oh, yes. Little Hugo's healthy.""

Little Hugo grasped the iron wall of his miniature prison. He pulled
himself toward it. His skirt caught in the floor. He pulled harder. The
pen moved toward him. A high soprano came from Mrs. Nolan. ""He's moved
it! I don't think I could move it myself! I tell you, I'm going to ask
the doctor to examine him. You shouldn't let a child be like that.""

Mrs. Danner, filled with consternation, sought refuge in prevarication.
""Nonsense,"" she said as calmly as she could. ""All we Douglases are like
that. Strong children. I had a grandfather who could lift a cider keg
when he was five--two hundred pounds and more. Hugo just takes after
him, that's all.""

Mrs. Nolan was annoyed. Partly because she was jealous of Hugo's
prowess--her own children had been feeble and dull. Partly because she
was frightened--no matter how strong a person became, a baby had no
right to be so powerful. Partly because she sensed that Mrs. Danner was
not telling the whole truth. She suspected that the Danners had found a
new way to raise children. ""Well,"" she said, ""all I have to say is that
it'll damage him. It'll strain his little heart. It'll do him a lot of
harm. If I had a child like that, I'd tie it up most of the time for the
first few years.""

""Kate,"" Mrs. Danner said unpleasantly, ""I believe you would.""

Mrs. Nolan shrugged. ""Well--I'm glad none of my children are freaks,
anyhow.""

""I'll get your sugar.""

In the afternoon the minister called. He talked of the church and the
town until he felt his preamble adequate. ""I was wondering why you
didn't bring your child to be baptized, Mrs. Danner. And why you
couldn't come to church, now that it is old enough?""

""Well,"" she replied carefully, ""the child is rather--irritable. And we
thought we'd prefer to have it baptized at home.""

""It's irregular.""

""We'd prefer it.""

""Very well. I'm afraid--"" he smiled--""that you're a
little--ah--unfamiliar with the upbringing of children. Natural--in the
case of the first-born. Quite natural. But--ah--I met Mrs. Nolan to-day.
Quite by accident. And she said that you kept the child--ah--in an iron
pen. It seemed unnecessarily cruel to me--""

""Did it?"" Mrs. Danner's jaw set squarely.

But the minister was not to be turned aside lightly. ""I'm afraid, if
it's true, that we--the church--will have to do something about it. You
can't let the little fellow grow up surrounded by iron walls. It will
surely point him toward the prison. Little minds are tender
and--ah--impressionable.""

""We've had a crib and two pens of wood,"" Mrs. Danner answered tartly.
""He smashed them all.""

""Ah? So?"" Lifted eyebrows. ""Temper, eh? He should be punished.
Punishment is the only mould for unruly children.""

""You'd punish a six-months-old baby?""

""Why--certainly. I've reared seven by the rod.""

""Well--"" a blazing maternal instinct made her feel vicious. ""Well--you
won't raise mine by a rod. Or touch it--by a mile. Here's your hat,
parson."" Mrs. Danner spent the next hour in prayer.

The village is known for the speed of its gossip and the sloth of its
intelligence. Those two factors explain the conditions which preluded
and surrounded the dawn of consciousness in young Hugo. Mrs. Danner's
extemporaneous fabrication of a sturdy ancestral line kept the more
supernatural elements of the baby's prowess from the public eye. It
became rapidly and generally understood that the Danner infant was
abnormal and that the treatment to which it was submitted was not usual.
At the same time neither the gossips of Indian Creek nor the slightly
more sage professors of the college exercised the wit necessary to
realize that, however strong young Hugo might become, it was neither
right nor just that his cradle days be augurs of that eventual estate.
On the face of it the argument seemed logical. If Mrs. Danner's forbears
had been men of peculiar might, her child might well be able to chin
itself at three weeks and it might easily be necessary to confine it in
a metal pen, however inhumane the process appeared.

Hugo was sheltered, and his early antics, peculiar and startling as they
were to his parents, escaped public attention. The little current of
talk about him was kept alive only because there was so small an array
of topics for the local burghers. But it was not extraordinarily
malicious. Months piled up. A year passed and then another.

Hugo was a good-natured, usually sober, and very sensitive child.
Abednego Danner's fear that his process might have created muscular
strength at the expense of reason diminished and vanished as Hugo
learned to walk and to talk, and as he grasped the rudiments of human
behaviour. His high little voice was heard in the house and about its
lawns.

They began to condition him. Throughout his later life there lingered in
his mind a memory of the barriers erected by his family. He was told not
to throw his pillow, when words meant nothing to him. Soon after that,
he was told not to throw anything. When he could walk, he was forbidden
to jump. His jumps were shocking to see, even at the age of two and a
half. He was carefully instructed on his behaviour out of doors. No move
of his was to indicate his difference from the ordinary child.

He was taught kindness and respect for people and property. His every
destructive impulse was carefully curbed. That training was possible
only because he was sensitive and naturally susceptible to advice.
Punishment had no physical terror for him, because he could not feel it.
But disfavour, anger, vexation, or disappointment in another person
reflected itself in him at once.

When he was four and a half, his mother sent him to Sunday school. He
was enrolled in a class that sat near her own, so she was able to keep a
careful eye on him. But Hugo did not misbehave. It was his first contact
with a group of children, his first view of the larger cosmos. He sat
quietly with his hands folded, as he had been told to sit. He listened
to the teacher's stories of Jesus with excited interest.

On his third Sunday he heard one of the children whisper: ""Here comes
the strong boy.""

He turned quickly, his cheeks red. ""I'm not. I'm not.""

""Yes, you are. Mother said so.""

Hugo struggled with the two hymn books on the table. ""I can't even lift
these books,"" he lied.

The other child was impressed and tried to explain the situation later,
taking the cause of Hugo's weakness against the charge of strength. But
the accusation rankled in Hugo's young mind. He hated to be
different--and he was beginning to realize that he was different.

From his earliest day that longing occupied him. He sought to hide his
strength. He hated to think that other people were talking about him.
The distinction he enjoyed was odious to him because it aroused
unpleasant emotions in other people. He could not realize that those
emotions sprang from personal and group jealousy, from the hatred of
superiority.

His mother, ever zealous to direct her son in the path of righteousness,
talked to him often about his strength and how great it would become and
what great and good deeds he could do with it. Those lectures on
virtuous crusades had two uses: they helped check any impulses in her
son which she felt would be harmful to her and they helped her to
become used to the abnormality in little Hugo. In her mind, it was like
telling a hunchback that his hump was a blessing disguised. Hugo was
always aware of the fact that her words connoted some latent evil in his
nature.

The motif grew in Mrs. Danner's thoughts until she sought a definite
outlet for it. One day she led her child to a keg filled with sand. ""All
of us,"" she said to her son, ""have to carry a burden through life. One
of your burdens will be your strength. But that might can make right.
See that little keg?""

""Mmmmm.""

""That keg is temptation. Can you say it?""

""Temshun.""

""Every day in your life you must bear temptation and throw it from you.
Can you bear it?""

""Huh?""

""Can you pick up that keg, Hugo?""

He lifted it in his chubby arms. ""Now take it to the barn and back,"" his
mother directed. Manfully he walked with the keg to the barn and back.
He felt a little silly and resentful. ""Now--throw temptation as far away
from you as you can.""

Mrs. Danner gasped. The distance he threw the keg was frightening.

""You musn't throw it so far, Hugo,"" she said, forgetting her allegory
for an instant.

""You said as far as I can. I can throw it farther, too, if I wanna.""

""No. Just throw it a little way. When you throw it far, it doesn't look
right. Now--fill it up with sand, and we'll do it over.""

Hugo was perplexed. A vague wish to weep occupied him as he filled the
keg. The lesson was repeated. Mrs. Danner had excellent Sunday-school
instincts, even if she had no real comprehension of ethics. Some days
later the burden of temptation was exhibited, in all its dramatic
passages, to Mrs. Nolan and another lady. Again Hugo was resentful and
again he felt absurd. When he threw the keg, it broke.

""My!"" Mrs. Nolan said in a startled tone.

""How awful!"" the other woman murmured. ""And he's just a child.""

That made Hugo suddenly angry and he jumped. The woman screamed. Mrs.
Nolan ran to tell whomever she could find. Mrs. Danner whipped her son
and he cried softly.

Abednego Danner left the discipline of his son to his wife. He watched
the child almost furtively. When Hugo was five, Mr. Danner taught him to
read. It was a laborious process and required an entire winter. But Hugo
emerged with a new world open to him--a world which he attacked with
interest. No one bothered him when he read. He could be found often on
sunny days, when other children were playing, prone on the floor,
puzzling out sentences in the books of the family library and trying to
catch their significance. During his fifth year he was not allowed to
play with other children. The neighbourhood insisted on that.

With the busybodyness and contrariness of their kind the same neighbours
insisted that Hugo be sent to school in the following fall. When, on the
opening day, he did not appear, the truant officer called for him. Hugo
heard the conversation between the officer and his mother. He was
frightened. He vowed to himself that his abnormality should be hidden
deeply.

After that he was dropped into that microcosm of human life to which so
little attention is paid by adults. School frightened and excited Hugo.
For one thing, there were girls in school--and Hugo knew nothing about
them except that they were different from himself. There were
teachers--and they made one work, whether one wished to work or not.
They represented power, as a jailer represents power. The children
feared teachers. Hugo feared them.

But the lesson of Hugo's first six years was fairly well planted. He
blushingly ignored the direct questions of those children whom his fame
had reached. He gave no reason to anyone for suspecting him of
abnormality. He became so familiar to his comrades that their curiosity
gradually vanished. He would not play games with them--his mother had
forbidden that. But he talked to them and was as friendly as they
allowed him to be. His sensitiveness and fear of ridicule made him a
voracious student. He liked books. He liked to know things and to learn
them.

Thus, bound by the conditionings of his babyhood, he reached the spring
of his first year in school without accident. Such tranquillity could
not long endure. The day which his mother had dreaded ultimately
arrived. A lanky farmer's son, older than the other children in the
first grade, chose a particularly quiet and balmy recess period to
plague little Hugo. The farmer's boy was, because of his size, the bully
and the leader of all the other boys. He had not troubled himself to
resent Hugo's exclusiveness or Hugo's reputation until that morning when
he found himself without occupation. Hugo was sitting in the sun, his
dark eyes staring a little sadly over the laughing, rioting children.

The boy approached him. ""Hello, strong man."" He was shrewd enough to
make his voice so loud as to be generally audible. Hugo looked both
harmless and slightly pathetic.

""I'm not a strong man.""

""Course you're not. But everybody thinks you are--except me. I'm not
afraid of you.""

""I don't want you to be afraid of me. I'm not afraid of you, either.""

""Oh, you aren't, huh? Look."" He touched Hugo's chest with his finger,
and when Hugo looked down, the boy lifted his finger into Hugo's face.

""Go away and let me alone.""

The tormentor laughed. ""Ever see a fish this long?""

His hands indicated a small fish. Involuntarily Hugo looked at them.
The hands flew apart and slapped him smartly. Several of the children
had stopped their play to watch. The first insult made them giggle. The
second brought a titter from Anna Blake, and Hugo noticed that. Anna
Blake was a little girl with curly golden hair and blue eyes. Secretly
Hugo admired her and was drawn to her. When she laughed, he felt a
dismal loneliness, a sudden desertion. The farmer's boy pressed the
occasion his meanness had made.

""I'll bet you ain't even strong enough to fight little Charlie Todd.
Commere, Charlie.""

""I am,"" Hugo replied with slow dignity.

""You're a sissy. You're a-scared to play with us.""

The ring around Hugo had grown. He felt a tangible ridicule in it. He
knew what it was to hate. Still, his inhibitions, his control, held him
in check. ""Go away,"" he said, ""or I'll hurt you.""

The farmer's boy picked up a stick and put it on his shoulder. ""Knock
that off, then, strong man.""

Hugo knew the dare and its significance. With a gentle gesture he
brushed the stick away. Then the other struck. At the same time he
kicked Hugo's shins. There was no sense of pain with the kick. Hugo saw
it as if it had happened to another person. The school-yard tensed with
expectation. But the accounts of what followed were garbled. The
farmer's boy fell on his face as if by an invisible agency. Then his
body was lifted in the air. The children had an awful picture of Hugo
standing for a second with the writhing form of his attacker above his
head. Then he flung it aside, over the circle that surrounded him, and
the body fell with a thud. It lay without moving. Hugo began to whimper
pitifully.

That was Hugo's first fight. He had defended himself, and it made him
ashamed. He thought he had killed the other boy. Sickening dread filled
him. He hurried to his side and shook him, calling his name. The other
boy came to. His arm was broken and his sides were purpling where Hugo
had seized him. There was terror in his eyes when he saw Hugo's face
above him, and he screamed shrilly for help. The teacher came. She sent
Hugo to the blacksmith to be whipped.

That, in itself, was a stroke of genius. The blacksmith whipped grown
boys in the high school for their misdeeds. To send a six-year-old child
was crushing. But Hugo had risen above the standards set by his society.
He had been superior to it for a moment, and society hated him for it.
His teacher hated him because she feared him. Mothers of children,
learning about the episode, collected to discuss it in high-pitched,
hateful voices. Hugo was enveloped in hate. And, as the lash of the
smith fell on his small frame, he felt the depths of misery. He was a
strong man. There was damnation in his veins.

The minister came and prayed over him. The doctor was sent for and
examined him. Frantic busybodies suggested that things be done to weaken
him--what things, they did not say. And Hugo, suffering bitterly, saw
that if he had beaten the farmer's boy in fair combat, he would have
been a hero. It was the scale of his triumph that made it dreadful. He
did not realize then that if he had been so minded, he could have turned
on the blacksmith and whipped him, he could have broken the neck of the
doctor, he could have run raging through the town and escaped unscathed.
His might was a secret from himself. He knew it only as a curse, like a
disease or a blemish.

During the ensuing four or five years Hugo's peculiar trait asserted
itself but once. It was a year after his fight with the bully. He had
been isolated socially. Even Anna Blake did not dare to tease him any
longer. Shunned and wretched, he built a world of young dreams and
confections and lived in it with whatever comfort it afforded.

One warm afternoon in a smoky Indian summer he walked home from school,
spinning a top as he walked, stopping every few yards to pick it up and
to let its eccentric momentum die on the palm of his hand. His pace
thereby was made very slow and he calculated it to bring him to his home
in time for supper and no sooner, because, despite his vigour, chores
were as odious to him as to any other boy. A wagon drawn by two horses
rolled toward him. It was a heavy wagon, piled high with grain-sacks,
and a man sat on its rear end, his legs dangling.

As the wagon reached Hugo, it jolted over a rut. There was a grinding
rip and a crash. Hugo pocketed his top and looked. The man sitting on
the back had been pinned beneath the rear axle, and the load held him
there. As Hugo saw his predicament, the man screamed in agony. Hugo's
blood chilled. He stood transfixed. A man jumped out of a buggy. A Negro
ran from a yard. Two women hurried from the spot. In an instant there
were six or seven men around the broken wagon. A sound of pain issued
from the mouth of the impaled man. The knot of figures bent at the sides
of the cart and tried to lift. ""Have to get a jack,"" Hugo heard them
say.

Hugo wound up his string and put it beside his top. He walked
mechanically into the road. He looked at the legs of the man on the
ground. They were oozing blood where the backboard rested on them. The
men gathered there were lifting again, without result. Hugo caught the
side and bent his small shoulders. With all his might he pulled up. The
wagon was jerked into the air. They pulled out the injured man. Hugo
lowered the wagon slowly.

For a moment no attention was paid to him. He waited pridefully for the
recognition he had earned. He dug in the dirt with the side of his shoe.
A man with a mole on his nose observed him. ""Funny how that kid's
strength was just enough to turn the balance.""

Hugo smiled. ""I'm pretty strong,"" he admitted.

Another man saw him. ""Get out of here,"" he said sharply. ""This is no
place for a kid.""

""But I was the one--""

""I said beat it. And I meant beat it. Go home to your ma.""

Slowly the light went from Hugo's eyes. They did not know--they could
not know. He had lifted more than two tons. And the men stood now,
waiting for the doctor, telling each other how strong they were when the
instant of need came.

""Go on, kid. Run along. I'll smack you.""

Hugo went. He forgot to spin his top. He stumbled a little as he
walked.




IV


Days, months, years. They had forgotten that Hugo was different. Almost,
for a while, he had forgotten it himself. He was popular in school. He
fostered the unexpressed theory that his strength had been a phenomenon
of his childhood--one that diminished as he grew older. Then, at ten, it
called to him for exercise.

Each day he rose with a feeling of insufficiency. Each night he retired
unrequited. He read. Poe, the Bible, Scott, Thackeray, Swift, Defoe--all
the books he could find. He thrilled with every syllable of adventure.
His imagination swelled. But that was not sufficient. He yearned as a
New England boy yearns before he runs away to sea.

At ten he was a stalwart and handsome lad. His brow was high and
surmounted by his peculiarly black hair. His eyes were wide apart, inky,
unfathomable. He carried himself with the grace of an athlete. He
studied hard and he worked hard for his parents, taking care of a cow
and chickens, of a stable and a large lawn, of flowers and a vegetable
garden.

Then one day he went by himself to walk in the mountains. He had not
been allowed to go into the mountains alone. A _Wanderlust_ that came
half from himself and half from his books led his feet along a narrow,
leafy trail into the forest depths. Hugo lay down and listened to the
birds in the bushes, to the music of a brook, and to the sound of the
wind. He wanted to be free and brave and great. By and by he stood up
and walked again.

An easy exhilaration filled his veins. His pace increased. ""I wonder,""
he thought, ""how fast I can run, how far I can jump."" He quickened his
stride. In a moment he found that the turns in the trail were too
frequent for him to see his course. He ran ahead, realizing that he was
moving at an abnormal pace. Then he turned, gathered himself, and jumped
carefully. He was astonished when he vaulted above the green covering of
the trail. He came down heavily. He stood in his tracks, tingling.

""Nobody can do that, not even an acrobat,"" he whispered. Again he tried,
jumping straight up. He rose fully forty feet in the air.

""Good Jesus!"" he exulted. In those lonely, incredible moments Hugo found
himself. There in the forest, beyond the eye of man, he learned that he
was superhuman. It was a rapturous discovery. He knew at that hour that
his strength was not a curse. He had inklings of his invulnerability.

He ran. He shot up the steep trail like an express train, at a rate that
would have been measured in miles to the hour rather than yards to the
minute. Tireless blood poured through his veins. Green streaked at his
sides. In a short time he came to the end of the trail. He plunged on,
careless of obstacles that would have stopped an ordinary mortal. From
trunk to trunk he leaped a burned stretch. He flung himself from a high
rock. He sped like a shadow across a pine-carpeted knoll. He gained the
bare rocks of the first mountain, and in the open, where the horror of
no eye would tether his strength, he moved in flying bounds to its
summit.

Hugo stood there, panting. Below him was the world. A little world. He
laughed. His dreams had been broken open. His depression was relieved.
But he would never let them know--he, Hugo, the giant. Except, perhaps,
his father. He lifted his arms--to thank God, to jeer at the world. Hugo
was happy.

He went home wondering. He was very hungry--hungrier than he had ever
been--and his parents watched him eat with hidden glances. Samson had
eaten thus, as if his stomach were bottomless and his food digested
instantly to make room for more. And, as he ate, Hugo tried to open a
conversation that would lead to a confession to his father. But it
seemed impossible.

Hugo liked his father. He saw how his mother dominated the little
professor, how she seemed to have crushed and bewildered him until his
mind was unfocused from its present. He could not love his mother
because of that. He did not reason that her religion had made her blind
and selfish, but he felt her blindness and the many cloaks that
protected her and her interests. He held her in respect and he obeyed
her. But often and wistfully he had tried to talk to his father, to make
friends with him, to make himself felt as a person.

Abednego Danner's mind was buried in the work he had done. His son was a
foreign person for whom he felt a perplexed sympathy. It is significant
that he had never talked to Hugo about Hugo's prowess. The ten-year-old
boy had not wished to discuss it. Now, however, realizing its extent, he
felt he must go to his father. After dinner he said: ""Dad, let's you and
me take a walk.""

Mrs. Danner's protective impulses functioned automatically. ""Not
to-night. I won't have it.""

""But, mother--""

Danner guessed the reason for that walk. He said to his wife with rare
firmness: ""If the boy wants to walk with me, we're going.""

After supper they went out. Mrs. Danner felt that she had been shut out
of her own son's world. And she realized that he was growing up.

Danner and his son strolled along the leafy street. They talked about
his work in school. His father seemed to Hugo more human than he had
ever been. He even ventured the first step toward other conversation.
""Well, son, what is it?""

Hugo caught his breath. ""Well--I kind of thought I ought to tell you.
You see--this afternoon--well--you know I've always been a sort of
strong kid--""

Danner trembled. ""I know--""

""And you haven't said much about it to me. Except to be gentle--""

""That's so. You must remember it.""

""Well--I don't have to be gentle with myself, do I? When I'm alone--like
in the woods, that is?""

The older one pondered. ""You mean--you like to--ah--let yourself
out--when you're alone?""

""That's what I mean."" The usual constraint between them had receded.
Hugo was grateful for his father's help. ""You see, dad, I--well--I went
walkin' to-day--and I--I kind of tried myself out.""

Danner answered in breathless eagerness: ""And?""

""Well--I'm not just a strong kid, dad. I don't know what's the matter
with me. It seems I'm not like other kids at all. I guess it's been
gettin' worse all these years since I was a baby.""

""Worse?""

""I mean--I been gettin' stronger. An' now it seems like I'm
about--well--I don't like to boast--but it seems like I'm about the
strongest man in the world. When I try it, it seems like there isn't any
stopping me. I can go on--far as I like. Runnin'. Jumpin'."" His
confession had commenced in detail. Hugo warmed to it. ""I can do things,
dad. It kind of scares me. I can jump higher'n a house. I can run
faster'n a train. I can pull up big trees an' push 'em over.""

""I see."" Danner's spine tingled. He worshipped his son then. ""Suppose
you show me.""

Hugo looked up and down the street. There was no one in sight. The
evening was still duskily lighted by afterglow. ""Look out then. I'm
gonna jump.""

Mr. Danner saw his son crouch. But he jumped so quickly that he
vanished. Four seconds elapsed. He landed where he had stood. ""See,
dad?""

""Do it again.""

On the second trial the professor's eyes followed the soaring form. And
he realized the magnitude of the thing he had wrought.

""Did you see me?""

Danner nodded. ""I saw you, son.""

""Kind of funny, isn't it?""

""Let's talk some more."" There was a pause. ""Do you realize, son, that no
one else on earth can do what you just did?""

""Yeah. I guess not.""

Danner hesitated. ""It's a glorious thing. And dangerous.""

""Yeah.""

The professor tried to simplify the biology of his discovery. He
perceived that it was going to involve him in the mysteries of sex. He
knew that to unfold them to a child was considered immoral. But Danner
was far, far beyond his epoch. He put his hand on Hugo's shoulder. And
Hugo set off the process.

""Dad, how come I'm--like this?""

""I'll tell you. It's a long story and a lot for a boy your age to know.
First, what do you know about--well--about how you were born?""

Hugo reddened. ""I--I guess I know quite a bit. The kids in school are
always talkin' about it. And I've read some. We're born like--well--like
the kittens were born last year.""

""That's right."" Banner knitted his brow. He began to explain the details
of conception as it occurs in man--the biology of ova and spermatazoa,
the differences between the anatomy of the sexes, and the reasons for
those differences. He drew, first, a botanical analogy. Hugo listened
intently. ""I knew most of that. I've seen--girls.""

""What?""

""Some of them--after school--let you.""

Danner was surprised, and at the same time he was amused. He had
forgotten the details of his young investigation. They are blotted out
of the minds of most adults--to the great advantage of dignity. He did
not show his amusement or his surprise.

""Girls like that,"" he answered, ""aren't very nice. They haven't much
modesty. It's rather indecent, because sex is a personal thing and
something you ought to keep for the one you're very fond of. You'll
understand that better when you're older. But what I was going to tell
you is this. When you were little more than a mass of plasm inside your
mother, I put a medicine in her blood that I had discovered. I did it
with a hypodermic needle. That medicine changed you. It altered the
structure of your bones and muscles and nerves and your blood. It made
you into a different tissue from the weak fibre of ordinary people.
Then--when you were born--you were strong. Did you ever watch an ant
carry many times its weight? Or see a grasshopper jump fifty times its
length? The insects have better muscles and nerves than we have. And I
improved your body till it was relatively that strong. Can you
understand that?""

""Sure. I'm like a man made out of iron instead of meat.""

""That's it, Hugo. And, as you grow up, you've got to remember that.
You're not an ordinary human being. When people find that out,
they'll--they'll--""

""They'll hate me?""

""Because they fear you. So you see, you've got to be good and kind and
considerate--to justify all that strength. Some day you'll find a use
for it--a big, noble use--and then you can make it work and be proud of
it. Until that day, you have to be humble like all the rest of us. You
mustn't show off or do cheap tricks. Then you'd just be a clown. Wait
your time, son, and you'll be glad of it. And--another thing--train your
temper. You must never lose it. You can see what would happen if you
did? Understand?""

""I guess I do. It's hard work--doin' all that.""

""The stronger, the greater, you are, the harder life is for you. And
you're the strongest of them all, Hugo.""

The heart of the ten-year-old boy burned and vibrated. ""And what about
God?"" he asked.

Danner looked into the darkened sky. ""I don't know much about Him,"" he
sighed.

Such was the soundest counsel that Hugo was given during his youth.
Because it came to him accompanied by unadulterated truths that he was
able to recognize, it exerted a profound effect on him. It is surprising
that his father was the one to give it. Nevertheless, Professor Danner
was the only person in all of Indian Creek who had sufficient
imagination to perceive his son's problems and to reckon with them in
any practical sense.

Hugo was eighteen before he gave any other indication of his strength
save in that fantastic and Gargantuan play which he permitted himself.
Even his play was intruded upon by the small-minded and curious world
before he had found the completeness of its pleasure. Then Hugo fell
into his coma.

Hugo went back to the deep forest to think things over and to become
acquainted with his powers. At first, under full pressure of his sinews,
he was clumsy and inaccurate. He learned deftness by trial and error.
One day he found a huge pit in the tangled wilderness. It had been an
open mine long years before. Sitting on its brink, staring into its pool
of verdure, dreaming, he conceived a manner of entertainment suitable
for his powers.

He jumped over its craggy edge and walked to its centre. There he
selected a high place, and with his hands he cleared away the growth
that covered it. Next he laid the foundations of a fort, over which he
was to watch the fastnesses for imaginary enemies. The foundations were
made of boulders. Some he carried and some he rolled from the floor of
the man-made canyon. By the end of the afternoon he had laid out a
square wall of rock some three feet in height. On the next day he added
to it until the four walls reached as high as he could stretch. He left
space for one door and he made a single window. He roofed the walls with
the trunks of trees and he erected a turret over the door.

For days the creation was his delight. After school he sped to it. Until
dark he strained and struggled with bare rocks. When it was finished, it
was an edifice that would have withstood artillery fire creditably. Then
Hugo experimented with catapults, but he found no engine that could hurl
the rocks he used for ammunition as far as his arms. He cached his
treasures in his fortress--an old axe, the scabbard of a sword, tops and
marbles, two cans of beans for emergency rations--and he made a flag of
blue and white cloth for himself.

Then he played in it. He pretended that Indians were stalking him. An
imaginary head would appear at the rim of the pit. Hugo would see it
through a chink. Swish! Crash! A puff of dust would show where rock met
rock--with the attacker's head between. At times he would be stormed on
all sides. To get the effect he would leap the canyon and hurl boulders
on his own fort. Then he would return and defend it.

It was after such a strenuous sally and while he was waiting in high
excitement for the enemy to reappear that Professors Whitaker and Smith
from the college stumbled on his stronghold. They were walking together
through the forest, bent on scaling the mountain to make certain
observations of an ancient cirque that was formed by the seventh great
glacier. As they walked, they debated matters of strata curvature.
Suddenly Whitaker gripped Smith's arm. ""Look!""

They stared through the trees and over the lip of Hugo's mine. Their
eyes bulged as they observed the size and weight of the fortress.

""Moonshiners,"" Smith whispered.

""Rubbish. Moonshiners don't build like that. It's a second Stonehenge.
An Indian relic.""

""But there's a sign of fresh work around it.""

Whitaker observed the newly turned earth and the freshly bared rock.
""Perhaps--perhaps, professor, we've fallen upon something big. A lost
race of Indian engineers. A branch of the Incas--or--""

""Maybe they'll be hostile.""

The men edged forward. And at the moment they reached the edge of the
pit, Hugo emerged from his fort. He saw the men with sudden fear. He
tried to hide.

""Hey!"" they said. He did not move, but he heard them scrambling slowly
toward the spot where he lay.

""Dressed in civilized clothes,"" the first professor said in a loud voice
as his eye located Hugo in the underbrush. ""Hey!""

Hugo showed himself. ""What?""

""Who are you?""

""Hugo Danner.""

""Oh--old Danner's boy, eh?""

Hugo did not like the tone in which they referred to his father. He made
no reply.

""Can you tell us anything about these ruins?""

""What ruins?""

They pointed to his fort. Hugo was hurt. ""Those aren't ruins. I built
that fort. It's to fight Indians in.""

The pair ignored his answer and started toward the fort. Hugo did not
protest. They surveyed its weighty walls and its relatively new roof.

""Looks recent,"" Smith said.

""This child has evidently renovated it. But it must have stood here for
thousands of years.""

""It didn't. I made it--mostly last week.""

They noticed him again. Whitaker simpered. ""Don't lie, young man.""

Hugo was sad. ""I'm not lying. I made it. You see--I'm strong."" It was as
if he had pronounced his own damnation.

""Tut, tut."" Smith interrupted his survey. ""Did you find it?""

""I built it.""

""I said""--the professor spoke with increasing annoyance--""I said not to
tell me stories any longer. It's important, young man, that we know just
how you found this dolmen and in what condition.""

""It isn't a dolly--whatever you said--it's a fort and I built it and I'm
not lying.""

The professor, in the interests of science, made a grave mistake. He
seized Hugo by the arms and shook him. ""Now, see here, young man, I'll
have no more of your impertinent lip. Tell me just what you've done to
harm this noble monument to another race, or, I swear, I'll slap you
properly."" The professor had no children. He tried, at the same time,
another tack, which insulted Hugo further. ""If you do, I'll give you a
penny--to keep.""

Hugo wrenched himself free with an ease that startled Smith. His face
was dark, almost black. He spoke slowly, as if he was trying to piece
words into sense. ""You--both of you--you go away from here and leave me
or I'll break your two rotten old necks.""

Whitaker moved toward him, and Smith interceded. ""We better leave
him--and come back later."" He was still frightened by the strength in
Hugo's arms. ""The child is mad. He may have hydrophobia. He might bite.""
The men moved away hastily. Hugo watched them climb the wall. When they
reached the top, he called gently. They wheeled.

And Hugo, sobbing, tears streaming from his face, leaped into his fort.
Rocks vomited themselves from it--huge rocks that no man could budge.
Walls toppled and crashed. The men began to move. Hugo looked up. He
chose a stone that weighed more than a hundred pounds.

""Hey!"" he said. ""I'm not a liar!"" The rock arched through the air and
Professors Whitaker and Smith escaped death by a scant margin. Hugo lay
in the wreck of the first thing his hands had built, and wept.

After a little while he sprang to his feet and chased the retreating
professors. When he suddenly appeared in front of them, they were
stricken dumb. ""Don't tell any one about that or about me,"" he said. ""If
you do--I'll break down your house just like I broke mine. Don't even
tell my family. They know it, anyhow.""

He leaped. Toward them--over them. The forest hid him. Whitaker wiped
clammy perspiration from his brow. ""What was it, Smith?""

""A demon. We can't mention it,"" he repeated, thinking of the warning.
""We can't speak of it anyway. They'll never believe us.""




V


Extremely dark of hair, of eyes and skin, moderately tall, and shaped
with that compact, breath-taking symmetry that the male figure sometimes
assumes, a brilliantly devised, aggressive head topping his broad
shoulders, graceful, a man vehemently alive, a man with the promise of a
young God. Hugo at eighteen. His emotions ran through his eyes like hot
steel in a dark mould. People avoided those eyes; they contained a
statement from which ordinary souls shrank.

His skin glowed and sweated into a shiny red-brown. His voice was deep
and alluring. During twelve long and fierce years he had fought to know
and control himself. Indian Creek had forgotten the terrible child.

Hugo's life at that time revolved less about himself than it had during
his first years. That was both natural and fortunate. If his classmates
in school and the older people of the town had not discounted his early
physical precocity, even his splendid vitality might not have been
sufficient to prevent him from becoming moody and melancholy.

But when with the passage of time he tossed no more bullies, carried no
more barrels of temptation, built no more fortresses, and grew so
handsome that the matrons of Indian Creek as well as the adolescent
girls in high school followed him with wayward glances, when the men
found him a gay and comprehending companion for any sport or adventure,
when his teachers observed that his intelligence was often
embarrassingly acute, when he played on three teams and was elected an
officer in his classes each year, then that half of Hugo which was
purely mundane and human dominated him and made him happy.

His adolescence, his emotions, were no different from those of any young
man of his age and character. If his ultimate ambitions followed another
trajectory, he postponed the evidence of it. Hugo was in love with Anna
Blake, the girl who had attracted him when he was six. The residents of
Indian Creek knew it. Her family received his calls with the winking
tolerance which the middle class grants to young passion. And she was
warm and tender and flirtatious and shy according to the policies that
she had learned from custom.

The active part of Hugo did not doubt that he would marry her after he
had graduated from the college in Indian Creek, that they would settle
somewhere near by, and that they would raise a number of children. His
subconscious thoughts made reservations that he, in moments when he was
intimate with himself, would admit frankly. It made him a little ashamed
of himself to see that on one night he would sit with Anna and kiss her
ardently until his body ached, and on another he would deliberately plan
to desert her. His idealism at that time was very great and untried and
it did not occur to him that all men are so deliberately calculating in
the love they disguise as absolute.

Anna had grown into a very attractive woman. Her figure was rounded and
tall. Her hair was darker than the waxy curls of her childhood, and a
vital gleam had come into it. Her eyes were still as blue and her voice,
shorn of its faltering youngness, was sweet and clear. She was
undoubtedly the prettiest girl in high school and the logical
sweet-heart for Hugo Danner. A flower ready to be plucked, at eighteen.

When Hugo reached his senior year, that readiness became almost an
impatience. Girls married at an early age in Indian Creek. She looked
down the corridor of time during which he would be in college, she felt
the pressure of his still slumbering passion, and she sensed his
superiority over most of the town boys. Only a very narrow critic would
call her resultant tactics dishonourable. They were too intensely human
and too clearly born of social and biological necessity.

She had let him kiss her when they were sixteen. And afterwards, before
she went to sleep, she sighed rapturously at the memory of his warm,
firm lips, his strong, rough arms. Hugo had gone home through the
dizzily spinning dusk, through the wind-strummed trees and the fragrant
fields, his breath deep in his chest, his eyes hot and somewhat
understanding.

Gradually Anna increased that license. She knew and she did not know
what she was doing. She played a long game in which she said: ""If our
love is consummated too soon, the social loss will be balanced by a
speedier marriage, because Hugo is honourable; but that will never
happen."" Two years after that first kiss, when they were floating on the
narrow river in a canoe, Hugo unfastened her blouse and exposed the
creamy beauty of her bosom to the soft moonlight and she did not
protest. That night he nearly possessed her, and after that night he
learned through her unspoken, voluptuous suggestion all the technique of
love-making this side of consummation.

When, finally, he called one night at her house and found that she was
alone and that her parents and her brother would not return until the
next day, they looked at each other with a shining agreement. He turned
the lights out and they sat on the couch in the darkness, listening to
the passing of people on the sidewalk outside. He undressed her. He
whispered halting, passionate phrases. He asked her if she was afraid
and let himself be laughed away from his own conscience. Then he took
her and loved her.

Afterwards, going home again in the gloom of late night, he looked up at
the stars and they stood still. He realized that a certain path of life
had been followed to its conclusion. He felt initiated into the adult
world. And it had been so simple, so natural, so sweet.... He threw a
great stone into the river and laughed and walked on, after a while.

Through the summer that followed, Hugo and Anna ran the course of their
affair. They loved each other violently and incessantly and with no
other evil consequence than to invite the open ""humphs"" of village
gossips and to involve him in several serious talks with her father.
Their courtship was given the benefit of conventional doubt, however,
and their innocence was hotly if covertly protested by the Blakes. Mrs.
Danner coldly ignored every fragment of insinuation. She hoped that Hugo
and Anna would announce their engagement and she hinted that hope. Hugo
himself was excited and absorbed. Occasionally he thought he was
sterile, with an inclination to be pleased rather than concerned if it
was true.

He added tenderness to his characteristics. And he loved Anna too much.
Toward the end of that summer she lost weight and became irritable. They
quarrelled once and then again. The criteria for his physical conduct
being vague in his mind, Hugo could not gauge it correctly. And he did
not realize that the very ardour of his relation with her was abnormal.
Her family decided to send her away, believing the opposite of the truth
responsible for her nervousness and weakness. A week before she left,
Hugo himself tired of his excesses.

One evening, dressing for a last passionate rendezvous, he looked in his
mirror as he tied his scarf and saw that he was frowning. Studying the
frown, he perceived with a shock what made it. He did not want to see
Anna, to take her out, to kiss and rumple and clasp her, to return
thinking of her, feeling her, sweet and smelling like her. It annoyed
him. It bored him. He went through it uneasily and quarrelled again. Two
days later she departed.

He acted his loss well and she did not show her relief until she sat on
the train, tired, shattered, and uninterested in Hugo and in life. Then
she cried. But Hugo was through. They exchanged insincere letters. He
looked forward to college in the fall. Then he received a letter from
Anna saying that she was going to marry a man she had met and known for
three weeks. It was a broken, gasping, apologetic letter. Every one was
outraged at Anna and astounded that Hugo bore the shock so courageously.

The upshot of that summer was to fill his mind with fetid memories,
which abated slowly, to make him disgusted with himself and tired of
Indian Creek. He decided to go to a different college, one far away from
the scene of his painful youth and his disillusioned maturity. He chose
Webster University because of the greatness of its name. If Abednego
Danner was hurt at his son's defection from his own college, he said
nothing. And Mrs. Danner, grown more silent and reserved, yielded to her
son's unexpected decision.

Hugo packed his bags one September afternoon, with a feeling of
dreaminess. He bade farewell to his family. He boarded the train. His
mind was opaque. The spark burning in it was one of dawning adventure
buried in a mass of detail. He had never been far from his native soil.
Now he was going to see cities and people who were almost foreign, in
the sophisticated East. But all he could dwell on was a swift cinema of
a defeated little boy, a strong man who could never be strong, a
surfeited love, a truant and dimly comprehensible blonde girl, a muddy
street and a red station, a clapboard house, a sonorous church with
hushed puppets in the pews, fudge parties, boats on the little river,
cold winter, and ice over the mountains, and a fortress where once upon
a time he had felt mightier than the universe.




VI


The short branch line to which Hugo changed brought him to the fringe of
the campus. The cars were full of boys, so many of them that he was
embarrassed. They all appeared to know each other, and no one spoke to
him. His dreams on the train were culminated. He had decided to become a
great athlete. With his mind's eye, he played the football he would
play--and the baseball. Ninety-yard runs, homers hit over the fence into
oblivion. Seeing the boys and feeling their lack of notice of him
redoubled the force of that decision. Then he stepped on to the station
platform and stood facing the campus. He could not escape a rush of
reverence and of awe; it was so wide, so green and beautiful. Far away
towered the giant arches of the stadium. Near by were the sharp Gothic
points of the chapel and the graduate college. Between them a score or
more of buildings rambled in and out through the trees.

""Hey!""

Hugo turned a little self-consciously. A youth in a white shirt and
white trousers was beckoning to him. ""Freshman, aren't you?""

""Yes. My name's Danner. Hugo Danner.""

""I'm Lefty Foresman. Chuck!"" A second student separated himself from the
bustle of baggage and young men. ""Here's a freshman.""

Hugo waited with some embarrassment. He wondered why they wanted a
freshman. Lefty introduced Chuck and then said: ""Are you strong,
freshman?""

For an instant he was stunned. Had they heard, guessed? Then he realized
it was impossible. They wanted him to work. They were going to haze him.
""Sure,"" he said.

""Then get this trunk and I'll show you where to take it.""

Hugo was handed a baggage check. He found the official and located the
trunk. Tentatively he tested its weight, as if he were a normally husky
youth about to undertake its transportation. He felt pleased that his
strength was going to be tried so accidentally and in such short order.
Lefty and Chuck heaved the trunk on his back. ""Can you carry it?"" they
asked.

""Sure.""

""Don't be too sure. It's a long way.""

Peering from beneath the trunk under which he bent with a fair
assumption of human weakness, Hugo had his first close glimpse of
Webster. They passed under a huge arch and down a street lined with
elms. Students were everywhere, carrying books and furniture, moving in
wheelbarrows and moving by means of the backs of other freshmen. The two
who led him were talking and he listened as he plodded.

""Saw Marcia just before I left the lake--took her out one night--and got
all over the place with her--and then came down--she's coming to the
first prom with me--and Marj to the second--got to get some beer
in--we'll buzz out and see if old Snorenson has made any wine this
summer. Hello, Eddie--glad to see you back--I've elected the dean's
physics, though, God knows, I'll never get a first in them and I need it
for a key. That damn Frosh we picked up sure must have been a
porter--hey, freshmen! Want a rest?""

""No, thanks.""

""Went down to the field this afternoon--looks all right to me. The team,
that is. Billings is going to quarter it now--and me after that--hope to
Christ I make it--they're going to have Scapper and Dwan back at Yale
and we've got a lot of work to do. Frosh! You don't need to drag that
all the way in one yank. Put it down, will you?""

""I'm not tired. I don't need a rest.""

""Well, you know best--but you ought to be tired. I would. Where do you
come from?""

""Colorado.""

""Huh! People go to Colorado. Never heard of any one coming from there
before. Whereabouts?""

""Indian Creek.""

""Oh."" There was a pause. ""You aren't an Indian, are you?"" It was asked
bluntly.

""Scotch Presbyterian for twenty generations.""

""Well, when you get through here, you'll be full of Scotch and emptied
of the Presbyterianism. Put the trunk down.""

Their talk of women, of classes, of football, excited Hugo. He was not
quite as amazed to find that Lefty Foresman was one of the candidates
for the football team as he might have been later when he knew how many
students attended the university and how few, relatively, were athletes.
He decided at once that he liked Lefty. The sophistication of his talk
was unfamiliar to Hugo; much of it he could not understand and only
guessed. He wanted Lefty to notice him. When he was told to put the
trunk down, he did not obey. Instead, with precision and ease, he swung
it up on his shoulder, held it with one hand and said in an unflustered
tone: ""I'm not tired, honestly. Where do we go from here?""

""Great howling Jesus!"" Lefty said, ""what have we here? Hey! Put that
trunk down."" There was excitement in his voice. ""Say, guy, do that
again.""

Hugo did it. Lefty squeezed his biceps and grew pale. Those muscles in
action lost their feel of flesh and became like stone. Lefty said: ""Say,
boy, can you play football?""

""Sure,"" Hugo said.

""Well, you leave that trunk with Chuck, here, and come with me.""

Hugo did as he had been ordered and they walked side by side to the
gymnasium. Hugo had once seen a small gymnasium, ill equipped and badly
lighted, and it had appealed mightily to him. Now he stood in a
prodigious vaulted room with a shimmering floor, a circular balcony, a
varied array of apparatus. His hands clenched. Lefty quit him for a
moment and came back with a man who wore knickers. ""Mr. Woodman, this
is--what the hell's your name?""

""Danner. Hugo Danner.""

""Mr. Woodman is football coach.""

Hugo took the man's hand. Lefty excused himself. Mr. Woodman said:
""Young Foresman said you played football.""

""Just on a high-school team in Colorado.""

""Said you were husky. Go in my office and ask Fitzsimmons to give you a
gym suit. Come out when you're ready.""

Hugo undressed and put on the suit. Fitzsimmons, the trainer, looked at
him with warm admiration. ""You're sure built, son.""

""Yeah. That's luck, isn't it?""

Then Hugo was taken to another office. Woodman asked him a number of
questions about his weight, his health, his past medical history. He
listened to Hugo's heart and then led him to a scale. Hugo had lied
about his weight.

""I thought you said one hundred and sixty, Mr. Danner?""

The scales showed two hundred and eleven, but it was impossible for a
man of his size and build to weigh that much. Hugo had lied
deliberately, hoping that he could avoid the embarrassment of being
weighed. ""I did, Mr. Woodman. You see--my weight is a sort of freak. I
don't show it--no one would believe it--and yet there it is."" He did not
go into the details of his construction from a plasm new to biology.

""Huh!"" Mr. Woodman said. Together they walked out on the floor of the
gymnasium. Woodman called to one of the figures on the track who was
making slow, plodding circuits. ""Hey, Nellie! Take this bird up and pace
him for a lap. Make it fast.""

A little smile came at the corners of Hugo's mouth. Several of the men
in the gymnasium stopped work to watch the trial of what was evidently a
new candidate. ""Ready?"" Woodman said, and the runners crouched side by
side. ""Set? Go!""

Nelson, one of the best sprinters Webster had had for years, dashed
forward. He had covered thirty feet when he heard a voice almost in his
ear. ""Faster, old man.""

Nelson increased. ""Faster, boy, I'm passing you."" The words were spoken
quietly, calmly. A rage filled Nelson. He let every ounce of his
strength into his limbs and skimmed the canvas. Half a lap. Hugo ran at
his side and Nelson could not lead him. The remaining half was not a
race. Hugo finished thirty feet in the lead.

Woodman, standing on the floor, wiped his forehead and bawled: ""That the
best you can do, Nellie?""

""Yes, sir.""

""What in hell have you been doing to yourself?""

Nelson drew a sobbing breath. ""I--haven't--done--a thing. Time--that
man. He's--faster than the intercollegiate mark.""

Woodman, still dubious, made Hugo run against time. And Hugo, eager to
make an impression and unguided by a human runner, broke the world's
record for the distance around the track by a second and three-fifths.
The watch in Woodman's hands trembled.

""Hey!"" he said, uncertain of his voice, ""come down here, will you?""

Hugo descended the spiral iron staircase. He was breathing with ease.
Woodman stared at him. ""Lessee you jump.""

Hugo was familiar with the distances for jumping made in track meets. He
was careful not to overdo his effort. His running jump was twenty-eight
feet, and his standing jump was eleven feet and some inches. Woodman's
face ran water. His eyes gleamed. ""Danner,"" he said, ""where did you get
that way?""

""What way?""

""I mean--what have you done all your life?""

""Nothing. Gone to school.""

""Two hundred and eleven pounds,"" Woodman muttered, ""run like an Olympic
champ--jump like a kangaroo--how's your kicking?""

""All right, I guess.""

""Passing?""

""All right, I guess.""

""Come on outside. Hey, Fitz! Bring a ball.""

An hour later Fitzsimmons found Woodman sitting in his office. Beside
him was a bottle of whisky which he kept to revive wounded gladiators.
""Fitz,"" said Woodman, looking at the trainer with dazed eyes, ""did you
see what I saw?""

""Yes, I did, Woodie.""

""Tell me about it.""

Fitzsimmons scratched his greying head. ""Well, Woodie, I seen a young
man--""

""Saw, Fitz.""

""I saw a young man come into the gym an' undress. He looked like an
oiled steam engine. I saw him go and knock hell out of three track
records without even losing his breath. Then I seen him go out on the
field an' kick a football from one end to the other an' pass it back.
That's what _I_ seen.""

Woodman nodded his head. ""So did I. But I don't believe it, do you?""

""I do. That's the man you--an' all the other coaches--have been wantin'
to see. The perfect athlete. Better in everything than the best man at
any one thing. Just a freak, Woodie--but, God Almighty, how New Haven
an' Colgate are goin' to feel it these next years!""

""Mebbe he's dumb, Fitz.""

""Mebbe. Mebbe not.""

""Find out.""

Fitz wasted no time. He telephoned to the registrar's office. ""Mr. H.
Danner,"" said the voice of a secretary, ""passed his examinations with
the highest honours and was admitted among the first ten.""

""He passed his entrance exams among the first ten,"" Fitzsimmons
repeated.

""God!"" said Woodman, ""it's the millennium!"" And he took a drink.

       *       *       *       *       *

Late in the afternoon of that day Hugo found his room in Thompson
Dormitory. He unpacked his carpet-bag and his straw suitcase. He checked
in his mind the things that he had done. It seemed a great deal for one
day--a complete alteration of his life. He had seen the dean and
arranged his classes: trigonometry, English, French, Latin, biology,
physics, economics, hygiene. With a pencil and a ruler he made a
schedule, which he pinned on the second-hand desk he had bought.

Then he checked his furniture: a desk, two chairs, a bed, bed-clothes, a
rug, sheets and blankets, towels. He hung his clothes in the closet. For
a while he looked at them attentively. They were not like the clothes of
the other students. He could not quite perceive the difference, but he
felt it, and it made him uncomfortable. The room to which he had been
assigned was pleasant. It looked over the rolling campus on two sides,
and both windows were framed in the leaves of nodding ivy.

It was growing dark. From a dormitory near by came the music of a banjo.
Presently the player sang and other voices joined with him. A warm and
golden sun touched the high clouds with lingering fire. Voices cried
out, young and vigorous. Hugo sighed. He was going to be happy at
Webster. His greatness was going to be born here.

At that time Woodman called informally on Chuck and Lefty. They were in
a heated argument over the decorative arrangement of various liquor
bottles when he knocked. ""Come in!"" they shouted in unison.

""Hello!""

""Oh, Woodie. Come in. Sit down. Want a drink--you're not in training?""

""No, thanks. Had one. And it would be a damn sight better if you birds
didn't keep the stuff around.""

""It's Chuck's."" Lefty grinned.

""All right. I came to see about that bird you brought to me--Danner.""

""Was he any good?""

Woodman hesitated. ""Fellows, if I told you how good he was, you wouldn't
believe me. He's so good--I'm scared of him.""

""Whaddaya mean?""

""Just that. He gave Nellie thirty feet in a lap on the track.""

""Great God!""

""He jumped twenty-eight and eleven feet--running and standing. He kicked
half a dozen punts for eighty and ninety yards and he passed the same
distance.""

Lefty sat down on the window seat. His voice was hoarse. ""That--can't be
done, Woodie.""

""I know it. But he did it. But that isn't what makes me frightened. How
much do you think he weighs?""

""One fifty-five--or thereabouts.""

Woodie shook his head. ""No, Lefty, he weighs two hundred and eleven.""

""Two eleven! He can't, Woodie. There's something wrong with your
scales.""

""Not a thing.""

The two students stared at each other and then at the coach. They were
able to grasp the facts intellectually, but they could not penetrate the
reactions of their emotions. At last Lefty said: ""But that
isn't--well--it isn't human, Woodie.""

""That's why I'm scared. Something has happened to this bird. He has a
disease of some kind--that has toughened him. Like Pott's disease, that
turns you to stone. But you wouldn't think it. There's not a trace of
anything on the surface. I'm having a blood test made soon. Wait till
to-morrow when you see him in action. It'll terrify you. Because you'll
have the same damned weird feeling I have--that he isn't doing one tenth
of what he can do--that he's really just playing with us all. By God, if
I was a bit superstitious, I'd throw up my job and get as much distance
between me and that bird as I could. I'm telling you simply to prepare
you. There's something mighty funny about him, and the sooner we find
out, the better.""

Mr. Woodman left the dormitory. Lefty and Chuck stared at each other for
the space of a minute, and then, with one accord, they went together to
the registrar's office. There they found Hugo's address on the campus,
and in a few minutes they were at his door.

""Come in,"" Hugo said. He smiled when he saw Lefty and Chuck. ""Want some
more trunks moved?""

""Maybe--later."" They sat down, eying Hugo speculatively. Lefty acted as
spokesman. ""Listen here, guy, we've just seen Woodie and he says you're
phenomenal--so much so that it isn't right.""

Hugo reddened. He had feared that his exhibition was exaggerated by his
eagerness to impress the coach. He said nothing and Lefty continued:
""You're going to be here for four years and you're going to love this
place. You're going to be willing to die for it. All the rest of your
life the fact that you went to old Webster is going to make a
difference. But there's one thing that Webster insists on--and that's
fair play. And honesty--and courage. You've come from a little town in
the West and you're a stranger here. Understand, this is all in a spirit
of friendship. So far--we like you. We want you to be one of us. To
belong. You have a lot to learn and a long way to go. I'm being frank
because I want to like you. For instance, Chuck here is a millionaire.
My old man is no dead stick in the Blue Book. Things like that will be
different from what you've known before. But the important thing is to
be a square shooter. Don't be angry. Do you understand?""

Hugo walked to the window and looked out into the thickened gloom. He
had caught the worry, the repression, in Lefty's voice. The youth, his
merry blue eyes suddenly grave, his poised self abnormally disturbed,
had suggested a criticism of some sort. What was it? Hugo was hurt and a
little frightened. Would his college life be a repetition of Indian
Creek? Would the athletes and the others in college of his own age fear
and detest him--because he was superior? Was that what they meant? He
did not know. He was loath to offend Lefty and Chuck. But there seemed
no alternative to the risk. No one had talked to him in that way for a
long time. He sat on his bed. ""Fellows,"" he said tersely, ""I don't think
I know what you're driving at. Will you tell me?""

The roommates fidgeted. They did not know exactly, either. They had come
to fathom the abnormality in Hugo. Chuck lit a cigarette. Lefty smiled
with an assumed ease. ""Why--nothing, Danner. You see--well--I'm
quarterback of the football team. And you'll probably be on it this
year--we haven't adopted the new idea of keeping freshmen off the
varsity. Just wanted to tell you those--well--those principles.""

Hugo knew he had not been answered. He felt, too, that he would never in
his life give away his secret. The defences surrounding it had been too
immutably fixed. His joy at knowing that he had been accepted so soon as
a logical candidate for the football team was tempered by this
questioning. ""I have principles, fellows.""

""Good."" Lefty rose. ""Guess we'll be going. By the way, Woodie said you
smashed a couple of track records to-day. Where'd you learn?""

""Nowhere.""

""How come, then?""

""Just--natural.""

Lefty summoned his will. ""Sure it isn't--well--unhealthy. Woodie says
there are a couple of diseases that make you--well--get tough--like
stone.""

Hugo realized the purpose of the visit. ""Then--be sure I haven't any
diseases. My father had an M.D."" He smiled awkwardly. ""Ever since I was
a kid, I've been stronger than most people. And I probably have a little
edge still. Just an accident, that's all. Is that what you were
wondering about?""

Lefty smiled with instant relief. ""Yes, it is. And I'm glad you take it
that way. Listen--why don't you come over to the Inn and take dinner
with Chuck and me? Let commons go for to-night. What say?""

       *       *       *       *       *

At eleven Hugo wound his alarm clock and set it for seven. He yawned
and smiled. All during supper he had listened to the glories of Webster
and the advantages of belonging to the Psi Delta fraternity, to
descriptions of parties and to episodes with girls. Lefty and Chuck had
embraced him in their circle. They had made suggestions about what he
should wear and whom he should know; they had posted him on the
behaviour best suited for each of his professors. They liked him and he
liked them, immensely. They were the finest fellows in the world.
Webster was a magnificent university. And he was going to be one of its
most glorious sons.

He undressed and went to bed. In a moment he slept, drawing in deep,
swift breaths. His face was smiling and his arm was extended, whether to
ward off shadows or to embrace a new treasure could not be told. In the
bright sunshine of morning his alarm jangled and he woke to begin his
career as an undergraduate.




VII


From the day of his arrival Webster University felt the presence of Hugo
Danner. Classes, football practice, hazing, fraternity scouting began on
that morning with a feverish and good-natured hurly-burly that, for a
time, completely bewildered him. Hugo participated in everything. He
went to the classroom with pleasure. It was never difficult for him to
learn and never easier than in those first few weeks. The professors he
had known (and he reluctantly included his own father) were dry-as-dust
individuals who had none of the humanities. And at least some of the
professors at Webster were brilliant, urbane, capable of all
understanding. Their lectures were like tonic to Hugo.

The number of his friends grew with amazing rapidity. It seemed that he
could not cross the campus without being hailed by a member of the
football team and presented to another student. The Psi Deltas saw to it
that he met the entire personnel of their chapter at Webster. Other
fraternities looked at him with covetous eyes, but Lefty Foresman, who
was chairman of the membership committee, let it be known that the Psi
Deltas had marked Hugo for their own. And no one refused their bid.

On the second Monday after college opened, Hugo went to the class
elections and found to his astonishment that he received twenty-eight
votes for president. A boy from a large preparatory school was elected,
but twenty-eight votes spoke well for the reputation he had gained in
that short time. On that day, too, he learned the class customs.
Freshmen had to wear black caps, black shoes and socks and ties. They
were not allowed to walk on the grass or to ride bicycles. The ancient
cannon in the center of the class square was defended annually by the
sophomores, and its theft was always attempted by the freshmen. No
entering class had stolen it in eight years. Those things amused Hugo.
They gave him an intimate feeling of belonging to his school. He wrote
to his parents about them.

Dean Aiken, the newly elected president of the freshman class,
approached Hugo on the matter of the cannon. ""We want a gang of good
husky boys to pull it up some night and take it away. Are you with us?""

""Sure.""

Left to his own considerations, Hugo recalled his promise and walked
across the campus with the object of studying the cannon. It was a
medium-sized piece of Revolutionary War vintage. It stood directly in
the rear of Webster Hall, and while Hugo regarded it, he noticed that
two sophomores remained in the vicinity. He knew that guard, changed
every two hours, would be on duty day and night until Christmas was
safely passed. Well, the cannon was secure. It couldn't be rolled away.
The theft of it would require first a free-for-all with the sophomores
and after a definite victory a mob assault of the gun. Hugo walked
closer to it.

""Off the grass, freshman!""

He wheeled obediently. One of the guards approached him. ""Get off the
grass and stay off and don't look at that cannon with longing. It isn't
healthy for young freshmen.""

Hugo grinned. ""All right, fella. But you better keep a double guard on
that thing while I want it.""

Two nights later, during a heavy rain that had begun after the fall of
dark, Hugo clad himself in a slicker and moved vaguely into the night.
Presently he reached the cannon yard, and in the shelter of an arch he
saw the sophomore guards. They smoked cigarettes, and one of them sang
softly. Day and night a pair of conscripted sentries kept watchful eyes
on the gun. A shout from either of them would bring the whole class
tumbling from its slumber in a very few moments. Hugo moved out of their
vision. The campus was empty.

He rounded Webster Hall, the mud sucking softly under his feet and the
rain dampening his face. From beneath his coat he took a flare and
lighted the fuse. He heard the two sophomores running toward it in the
thick murk. When they were very close, he stepped on to the stone
flagging, looked up into the cloudy sky, gathered himself, and leaped
over the three stories of Webster Hall. He landed with a loud thud ten
feet from the cannon. When the sophomores returned, after extinguishing
the flare, their cherished symbol of authority had vanished.

There was din on the campus. First the loud cries of two voices. Then
the screech of raised windows, the babble of more voices, and the rush
of feet that came with new gusts of rain. Flash-lights pierced the
gloom. Where the cannon had been, a hundred and then two hundred figures
gathered, swirled, organized search-parties, built a fire. Dawn came,
and the cannon was still missing. The clouds lifted. In the wan light
some one pointed up. There, on the roof of Webster Hall, with the
numerals of the freshman class painted on its muzzle, was the old
weapon. Arms stretched. An angry, incredulous hum waxed to a steady
pitch and waned as the sophomores dispersed.

In the morning, theory ran rife. The freshmen were tight-lipped,
pretending knowledge where they had none, exulting secretly. Dean Aiken
was kidnapped at noon and given a third degree, which extorted no
information. The theft of the cannon and its elevation to the roof of
the hall entered the annals of Webster legend. And Hugo, watching the
laborious task of its removal from the roof, seemed merely as pleased
and as mystified as the other freshmen.

So the autumn commenced. The first football game was played and Hugo
made a touchdown. He made another in the second game. They took him to
New York in November for the dinner that was to celebrate the entrance
of a new chapter to Psi Delta.

His fraternity had hired a private car. As soon as the college towers
vanished, the entertainment committee took over the party. Glasses were
filled with whisky and passed by a Negro porter. Hugo took his with a
feeling of nervousness and of excited anticipation. The coach had given
him permission to break training--advised it, in fact. And Hugo had
never tasted liquor. He watched the others, holding his glass gingerly.
They swallowed their drinks, took more. The effect did not seem to be
great. He smelled the whisky, and the smell revolted him.

""Drink up, Danner!""

""Never use the stuff. I'm afraid it'll throw me.""

""Not you. Come on! Bottoms up!""

It ran into his throat, hot and steaming. He swallowed a thousand
needles and knew the warmth of it in his stomach. They gave another
glass to him and then a third. Some of the brothers were playing cards.
Hugo watched them. He perceived that his feet were loose on their ankles
and that his shoulders lurched. It would not do to lose control of
himself, he thought. For another man, it might be safe. Not for him. He
repeated the thought inanely. Some one took his arm.

""Nice work in the game last week. Pretty.""

""Thanks.""

""Woodie says you're the best man on the team. Glad you went Psi Delt.
Best house on the campus. Great school, Webster. You'll love it.""

""Sure,"" Hugo said.

The railroad coach was twisting and writhing peculiarly. Hugo suddenly
wanted to be in the air. He hastened to the platform of the car and
stood on it, squinting his eyes at the countryside. When they reached
the Grand Central Terminal he was cured of his faintness. They rode to
the theatre in an omnibus and saw the matinée of a musical show. Hugo
had never realized that so many pretty girls could be gathered together
in one place. Their scant, glittering costumes flashed in his face. He
wanted them. Between the acts the fraternity repaired in a body to the
lavatory and drank whisky from bottles.

Hugo began to feel that he was living at last. He was among men,
sophisticated men, and learning to be like them. Nothing like the
_camaraderie_, the show, the liquor, in Indian Creek. He was wearing the
suit that Lefty Foresman had chosen for him. He felt well dressed, cool,
capable. He was intensely well disposed toward his companions. When the
show was over, he stood in the bright lights, momentarily depressed by
the disappearance of the long file of girls. Then he shouldered among
his companions and went out of the theatre riotously.

Two long tables were drawn up at the Raven, a restaurant famous for its
roast meats, its beer, and its lack of scruples about the behaviour of
its guests. The Psi Deltas took their places at the tables. The
dining-room they occupied was private. Hugo saw as if in a dream the
long rows of silverware, the dishes of celery and olives, and the ranks
of shining glasses. They sat. Waiters wound their way among them. There
was a song. The toastmaster, a New York executive who had graduated from
Webster twenty years before, understood the temper of his charge. He was
witty, ribald, genial.

He made a speech, but not too long a speech. He called on the president
of a bank, who rose totteringly and undid the toastmaster's good offices
by making too long a speech. Its reiterated ""dear old Websters"" were
finally lost in the ring and tinkle of glassware and cutlery.

At the end of the long meal Hugo realized that his being had undergone
change. Objects approached and receded before his vision. The voice of
the man sitting beside him came to his ears as if through water. His
mind continually turned upon itself in a sort of infatuated examination.
His attention could not be held even on his own words. He decided that
he was feverish. Then some one said: ""Well, Danner, how do you like
being drunk?""

""Drunk?""

""Sure. You aren't going to tell me you're sober, are you?""

When the speaker had gone, Hugo realized that it was Chuck. There had
been no feeling of recognition. ""I'm drunk!"" he said.

""Some one give Danner a drink. He has illusions.""

""Drunk! Why, this man isn't drunk. It's monstrous. He has a weakened
spine, that's all.""

""I'm drunk,"" Hugo repeated. He knew then what it was to be drunk. The
toastmaster was rising again. Hugo saw it dimly.

""Fellows!"" A fork banged on a glass. ""Fellows!"" There was a slow
increase in silence. ""Fellows! It's eleven o'clock now. And I have a
surprise for you.""

""Surprise! Hey, guys, shut up for the surprise!""

""Fellows! What I was going to say is this: the girls from the show we
saw this afternoon are coming over here--all thirty of 'em. We're going
up to my house for a real party. And the lid'll be off. Anything
goes--only anybody that fights gets thrown out straight off without an
argument. Are you on?""

The announcement was greeted by a stunned quiet which grew into a bellow
of approval. Plates and glasses were thrown on the floor. Lefty leaped
on to the table and performed a dance. The proprietor came in, looked,
and left hastily, and then the girls arrived.

They came through the door, after a moment of reluctant hesitation, like
a flood of brightly colored water. They sat down in the laps of the
boys, on chairs, on the edge of the disarrayed tables. They were served
with innumerable drinks as rapidly as the liquor could be brought. They
were working, that night, for the ten dollars promised to each one. But
they were working with college boys, which was a rest from the stream of
affluent and paunchy males who made their usual escort. Their gaiety was
better than assumed.

Hugo had never seen such a party or dreamed of one. His vision was
cleared instantly of its cobwebs. He saw three boys seize one girl and
turn her heels over head. A piano was moved in. She jumped up and
started dancing on the table. Then there was a voice at his side.

""Hello, good-looking. I could use that drink if you can spare it.""

Hugo looked at the girl. She had brown hair that had been curled. Her
lips and cheeks were heavily rouged and the corners of her mouth turned
down in a sort of petulance or fatigue. But she was pretty. And her
body, showing whitely above her evening dress, was creamy and warm. He
gave the drink to her. She sat in his lap.

""Gosh,"" he whispered. She laughed.

""I saw her first,"" some one said, pulling at the girl's arm.

""Go 'way,"" Hugo shouted. He pushed the other from them. ""What's your
name?""

""Bessie. What's yours?""

""Hugo.""

The girl accepted two glasses from a waiter. They drained them, looking
at each other over the rims. ""Got any money, Hugo?""

Hugo had. He carried on his person the total of his cash assets. Some
fifty dollars. ""Sure. I have fifty dollars,"" he answered.

He felt her red lips against his ear. ""Let's you and me duck this party
and have a little one of our own. I've got an apartment not far from
here.""

He could hear the pounding of his heart. ""Let's.""

They moved unostentatiously from the room. Outside, in the hall, she
took his hand. They ran to the front door.

There was the echo of bedlam in his whirling mind when they walked
through the almost deserted street. She called to a taxi and they were
driven for several blocks. At a cheap dance hall they took a table and
drank more liquor. When his head was turned, she narrowed her eyes and
calculated the effect of the alcohol against the dwindling of his purse.
They danced.

""Gee, you're a swell dancer.""

""So are you, Bessie.""

""Still wanna go home with Bessie?""

""Mmmm.""

""Let's go.""

Another taxi ride. The lights seethed past him. A dark house and three
flights of rickety stairs. The gritty sound of a key in a lock. A little
room with a table, a bed, two chairs, a gas-light turned low, a
disheveled profusion of female garments.

""Here we are. Sit down.""

Hugo looked at her tensely. He laughed then, with a harsh sound. She
flew into his arms, returning his searching caresses with startling
frankness. Presently they moved across the room. He could hear the
noises on the street at long, hot intervals.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hugo opened his eyes and the light smote them with pain. He raised his
head wonderingly. His stomach crawled with a foul nausea. He saw the
dirty room. Bessie was not in it. He staggered to the wash-bowl and was
sick. He noticed then that her clothes were missing. The fact impressed
him as one that should have significance. He rubbed his head and eyes.
Then he thought accurately. He crossed the room and felt in his trousers
pockets. The money was gone.

At first it did not seem like a catastrophe. He could telegraph to his
father for more money. Then he realized that he was in New York, without
a ticket back to the campus, separated from his friends, and not knowing
the address of the toastmaster. He could not find his fraternity
brothers and he could not get back to school without more money.
Moreover, he was sick.

He dressed with miserable slowness and went down to the street. Served
him right. He had been a fool. He shrugged. A sharp wind blew out of a
bright sky.

Maybe, he thought, he should walk back to Webster. It was only eighty
miles and that distance could be negotiated in less than two hours by
him. But that was unwise. People would see his progress. He sat down in
Madison Square Park and looked at the Flatiron Building with a leisurely
eye. A fire engine surged up the street. A man came to collect the trash
in a green can. A tramp lay down and was ousted by a policeman.

By and by he realized that he was hungry. A little man with darting eyes
took a seat beside him. He regarded Hugo at short intervals. At length
he said. ""You got a dime for a cup of coffee?"" His words were blurred by
accent.

""No. I came here from school last night and my money was stolen.""

""Ah,"" there was a tinge of discouragement in the other's voice. ""And
hungry, perhaps?""

""A little.""

""Me--I am also hungry. I have not eaten since two days.""

That impressed Hugo as a shameful and intolerable circumstance. ""Let's
go over there""--he indicated a small restaurant--""and eat. Then I'll
promise to send the money by mail. At least, we'll be fed that way.""

""We will be thrown to the street on our faces.""

""Not I. Nobody throws me on my face. And I'll look out for you.""

They crossed the thoroughfare and entered the restaurant. The little man
ordered a quantity of food, and Hugo, looking guiltily at the waiter,
duplicated the order. They became distantly acquainted during the
filched repast. The little man's name was Izzie. He sold second-hand
rugs. But he was out of work. Eventually they finished. The waiter
brought the check. He was a large man, whose jowls and hips and
shoulders were heavily weighted with muscle.

Hugo stood up. ""Listen, fellow,"" he began placidly, ""my friend and I
haven't a cent between us. I'm Hugo Danner, from Webster University, and
I'll mail you the price of this feed to-morrow. I'll write down my name
and--""

He got no further. The waiter spoke in a thick voice. ""So! One of them
guys, eh? Tryin' to get away with it when I'm here, huh? Well, I tell
you how you're gonna pay. You're gonna pay this check with a bloody
mush, see?"" His fist doubled and drew back. Hugo did not shift his
position. The fist came forward, but an arm like stone blocked it.
Hugo's free hand barely flicked to the waiter's jaw. He rolled under the
table. ""Come on,"" he said, but Izzie had already vanished through the
door.

Hugo walked hurriedly up the street and turned a corner. A hand tugged
at his coat. He turned and was confronted by Izzie. ""I seen you through
the window. Jeest, guy, you kin box. Say, I know where you kin clean
up--if you got the nerve.""

""Clean up? Where?""

""Come on. We better get out of here anyhow.""

They made their way toward the river. The city changed character on the
other side of the elevated railroad, and presently they were walking
through a dirty, evil-smelling, congested neighborhood.

""Where are we going, Izzie?""

""Wait a minute, Mr. Danner.""

""What's the idea?""

""You wait.""

Another series of dirty blocks. Then they came to a bulky building that
spread a canopy over the sidewalk. ""Here,"" Izzie said, and pointed.

His finger indicated a sign, which Hugo read twice. It said: ""Battling
Ole Swenson will meet all comers in this gymnasium at three this
afternoon and eight to-night. Fifty dollars will be given to any man,
black or white, who can stay three rounds with him, and one hundred
dollars cash money to the man who knocks out Battling Ole Swenson, the
Terror of the Docks.""

""See,"" Izzie said, rubbing his hands excitedly, ""mebbe you could do it.""

A light dawned on Hugo. He smiled. ""I can,"" he replied. ""What time is
it?""

""Two o'clock.""

""Well, let's go.""

They entered the lobby of the ""gymnasium."" ""Mr. Epstein,"" Izzie called,
""I gotta fighter for the Swede.""

Mr. Epstein was a pale fat man who ignored the handicap of the dank
cigar in his mouth and roared when he spoke. He glanced at Hugo and then
addressed Izzie. ""Where is he?""

""There.""

Epstein looked at Hugo and then was shaken by laughter. ""There, you
says, and there I looks and what do I see but a pink young angel face
that Ole would swallow without chewing.""

Hugo said: ""I don't think so. I'm willing to try.""

Epstein scowled. ""Run away from here, kid, before you get hurt. Ole
would laugh at you. This isn't easy money. It takes a man to get a look
at it.""

Izzie stamped impatiently. ""I tell you, Mr. Epstein, I seen this boy
fight. He's the goods. He can beat your Ole. I bet he can."" His voice
caught and he glanced nervously at Hugo. ""I bet ten dollars he can.""

""How much?"" Epstein bellowed.

""Well--say twenty dollars.""

""How much?""

""Fifty dollars. It's all I got, Epstein.""

""All right--go in and sign up and leave your wad. Kid,"" he turned to
Hugo, ""you may think you're husky, but Ole is a killer. He's six nine in
his socks and he weighs two hundred and eighty. He'll mash you.""

""I don't think so,"" Hugo repeated.

""Well, you'll be meat. We'll put you second on the list. And the
lights'll go out fast enough for yuh.""

Hugo followed Izzie and reached him in time to see a fifty-dollar bill
peeled from a roll which was extracted with great intricacy from Izzie's
clothes. ""I thought you hadn't eaten for two days!""

""It's God's truth,"" Izzie answered uneasily. ""I was savin' this
dough--an' it's lucky, too, isn't it?""

Hugo did not know whether to laugh or to be angry. He said: ""And you'd
have let me take a poke in the jaw from that waiter. You're a hell of a
guy, Izzie.""

Izzie moved his eyes rapidly. ""I ain't so bad. I'm bettin' on you, ain't
I? An' I got you a chancet at the Swede, didn't I?""

""How'd you know that waiter couldn't kill me?""

""Well--he didn't. Anyhow, what's a poke in the jaw to a square meal,
eh?""

""When the other fellow gets the poke and you get the meal. All right,
Izzie. I wish I thought Ole was going to lick me.""

Hugo wrote his name under a printed statement to the effect that the
fight managers were not responsible for the results of the combat. The
man who led him to a dressing-room was filled with sympathy and advice.
He told Hugo that one glance at Ole would discourage his reckless
avarice. But Hugo paid no attention. The room was dirty. It smelled of
sweat and rubber sneakers. He sat there for half an hour, reading a
newspaper. Outside, somewhere, he could hear the mumble of a gathering
crowd, punctuated by the voices of candy and peanut-hawkers.

At last they brought some clothes to him. A pair of trunks that flapped
over his loins, ill-fitting canvas shoes, a musty bath robe. When the
door of his room opened, the noise of the crowd was louder. Finally it
was hushed. He heard the announcer. It was like the voice of a minister
coming through the stained windows of a church. It rose and fell. Then
the distant note of the gong. After that the crowd called steadily,
sometimes in loud rage and sometimes almost in a whisper.

Finally they brought Ole's first victim into Hugo's cell. He was a man
with the physique of a bull. His face was cut and his eyes were
darkening. One of the men heaving his stretcher looked at Hugo.

""Better beat it, kid, while you can still do it on your own feet. You
ain't even got the reach for Ole. He's a grizzly, bo. He'll just about
kill you.""

Hugo tightened his belt and swung the electric light back and forth with
a slow-moving fist. Another man expertly strapped his fists with
adhesive tape.

""When do I go out?"" Hugo asked.

""You mean, when do you get knocked out?"" the second laughed.

""Fight?""

""Well, if you're determined to get croaked, you do it now.""

In the arena it was dazzling. A bank of noisy people rose on all sides
of him. Hugo walked down the aisle and clambered into the ring. Ole was
one of the largest men he had ever seen in his life. There was no doubt
of his six feet nine inches and his two hundred and eighty pounds. Hugo
imagined that the man was not a scientific fighter. A bruiser. Well, he
knew nothing of fighting, either.

A man in his shirt sleeves stood up in the ring and bellowed, ""The next
contestant for the reward of fifty dollars to stay three rounds with
battling Ole and one hundred dollars to knock him out is Mr. H. Smith.""
They cheered. It was a nasty sound, filled with the lust for blood. Hugo
realized that he was excited. His knees wabbled when he rose and his
hand trembled as he took the monstrous paw of the Swede and saw his
unpleasant smile. Hugo's heart was pounding. For one instant he felt
weak and human before Battling Ole. He whispered to himself: ""Quit it,
you fool; you know better; you can't even be hurt."" It did not make him
any more quiet.

Then they were sitting face to face. A bell rang. The hall became silent
as the mountainous Swede lumbered from his corner. He towered over Hugo,
who stood up and went out to meet him like David approaching Goliath. To
the crowd the spectacle was laughable. There was jeering before they
met. ""Where's your mamma?"" ""Got your bottle, baby?"" ""Put the poor little
bastard back in his carriage."" ""What's this--a fight or a freak show?""
Laughter.

It was like cold water to Hugo. His face set. He looked at Ole. The
Swede's fist moved back like the piston of a great engine into which
steam has been let slowly. Then it came forward. Hugo, trained to see
and act in keeping with his gigantic strength, dodged easily. ""Atta
boy!"" ""One for Johnny-dear!"" The fist went back and came again and
again, as if that piston, gathering speed, had broken loose and was
flailing through the screaming air. Hugo dodged like a beam of light,
and the murderous weapon never touched him. The spectators began to
applaud his speed. He could beat the Swede's fist every time. ""Run him,
kiddo!"" ""It's only three rounds.""

The bell. Ole was panting. As he sat in his corner, his coal-scuttle
gloves dangling, he cursed in his native tongue. Too little to hit.
Bell. The second round was the same. Hugo never attempted to touch the
Swede. Only to avoid him. And the man worked like a Trojan. Sweat
seethed over his big, blank face. His small eyes sharpened to points. He
brought his whole carcass flinging through the air after his fist. But
every blow ended in a sickening wrench that missed the target. The crowd
grew more excited. During the interval between the second and third
rounds there was betting on the outcome. Three to one that Ole would
connect and murder the boy. Four to one. One to five that Hugo would win
fifty dollars before he died beneath the trip-hammer.

The third round opened. The crowd suddenly tired of the sport. A shrill
female voice reached Hugo's cold, concentrated mind: ""Keep on running,
yellow baby!""

So. They wanted a killing. They called him yellow. The Swede was on him,
elephantine, sweating, sucking great, rumbling breaths of air, swinging
his fists. Hugo studied the motion. That fist to that side, up, down,
now!

Like hail they began to land upon the Swede. Bewilderingly, everywhere.
No hope of guarding. Every blow smashed, stung, ached. No chance to
swing back. Cover up. His arms went over his face. He felt rivets drive
into his kidneys. He reached out and clinched. They rocked in each
other's arms. Dazed by that bitter onslaught of lightning blows, Ole
thought only to lock Hugo in his arms and crush him. When they clinched,
the crowd, grown instantly hysterical, sank back in despair. It was
over. Ole could break the little man's back. They saw his arms spring
into knots. Jesus! Hugo's fist shot between their chests and Ole was
thrown violently backward. Impossible. He lunged back, crimson to kill,
one hand guarding his jaw. ""Easy, now, for the love of God, easy,"" Hugo
said to himself. There. On the hand at the chin. Hugo's gloves went out.
Lift him! It connected. The Swede left the floor and crumpled slowly,
with a series of bumping sounds. And how the hyenas yelled!

They crowded into his dressing-room afterwards. Epstein came to his side
before he had dressed. ""Come out and have a mug of suds, kid. That was
the sweetest fight I ever hope to live to see. I can sign you up for a
fortune right now. I can make you champ in two years.""

""No, thanks,"" Hugo said.

The man persisted. He talked earnestly. He handed Hugo a hundred-dollar
bill. Hugo finished his dressing. Izzie wormed his way in. ""Fifty
dollars I won yet! Didn't I tole you, Mr. Epstein!""

""Come here, Izzie!""

The little man ran to shake Hugo's hand, but it was extended for another
reason. ""I want that fifty you won,"" he said unsmilingly. ""When a bird
tracks along for a free feed and lets another guy fight for him and has
a roll big enough to stop up a rainspout, he owes money. That lunch will
set you back just exactly what you won on me.""

There was laughter in the room. Izzie whimpered. ""Ain't you got a
hundred all ready that I got for you? Ain't it enough that you got it?
Ain't I got a wife wit' kids yet?""

""No, it ain't, yet."" Hugo snapped the fingers of his extended hand. The
other hand doubled significantly. Izzie gave him the money. He was
almost in tears. The others guffawed.

""Wait up, bo. Give us your address if you ever change your mind. You can
pick up a nice livin' in this game.""

""No, thanks. All I needed was railroad fare. Thank you,
gentlemen--and--good-by.""

No one undertook to hinder Hugo's departure.




VIII


Greatness seemed to elude Hugo, success such as he had earned was
inadequate, and his friendships as well as his popularity were tinged
with a sort of question that he never understood. By the end of winter
he was well established in Webster as a great athlete. Psi Delta sang
his praises and was envied his deeds. Lefty and Chuck treated him as a
brother. And, Hugo perceived, none of that treatment and none of that
society was quite real. He wondered if his personality was so meagre
that it was not equal to his strength. He wondered if his strength was
really the asset he had dreamed it would be, and if, perhaps, other
people were not different from him in every way, so that any close human
contact was impossible to him.

It was a rather tragic question to absorb a man so filled with life and
ambition as he. Yet every month had raised it more insistently. He saw
other men sharing their inmost souls and he could never do that. He saw
those around him breaking their hearts and their lungs for the
university, and, although it was never necessary for him to do that, he
doubted that he could if he would. Webster was only a school. A
sentiment rather than an ideal, a place rather than a goal of dreams. He
thought that he was cynical. He thought that he was inhuman. It worried
him.

His love was a similar experience. He fell in love twice during that
first year in college. Once at a prom with a girl who was related to
Lefty--a rich, socially secure girl who had studied abroad and who
almost patronized her cousin.

Hugo had seen her dancing, and her long, slender legs and arms had
issued an almost tangible challenge to him. She had looked over Lefty's
shoulder and smiled vaguely. They had met. Hugo danced with her. ""I love
to come to a prom,"" she said; ""it makes me feel young again.""

""How old are you?""

She ignored the obvious temptation to be coy and he appreciated that.
""Twenty-one.""

It seemed reasonably old to Hugo. The three years' difference in their
ages had given her a pinnacle of maturity.

""And that makes you old,"" he reflected.

She nodded. Her name was Iris. Afterwards Hugo thought that it should
have been Isis. Half goddess, half animal. He had never met with the
vanguard of emancipated American womanhood before then. ""You're the
great Hugo Danner, aren't you? I've seen your picture in the sporting
sections."" She read sporting sections. He had never thought of a woman
in that light. ""But you're really much handsomer. You have more sex and
masculinity and you seem more intelligent.""

Then, between the dances, Lefty had come. ""She? Oh, she's a sort of
cousin. Flies in all the high altitudes in town. Blue Book and all that.
Better look out, Hugo. She plays rough.""

""She doesn't look rough.""

Both youths watched her. Long, dark hair, willowy body, high, pale
forehead, thin nose, red mouth, smiling like a lewd agnostic and dancing
close to her partner, enjoying even that. ""Well, look out, Hugo. If she
wants to play, don't let her play with your heart. Anything else is
quite in the books.""

""Oh.""

She came to the stag line, ignoring a sequence of invitations, and asked
him to dance. They went out on the velvet campus. ""I could love you--for
a little while,"" she said. ""It's too bad you have to play football
to-morrow.""

""Is that an excuse?""

She smiled remotely. ""You're being disloyal."" Her fan moved delicately.
""But I shan't chide you. In fact, I'll stay over for the game--and I'll
enjoy the anticipation--more, perhaps. But you'll have to win it--to win
me. I'm not a soothing type.""

""It will be easy--to win,"" Hugo said and she peered through the darkness
with admiration, because he had made his ellipsis of the object very
plain.

""It is always easy for you to win, isn't it?"" she countered with an easy
mockery, and Hugo shivered.

The game was won. Hugo had made his touchdown. He unfolded a note she
had written on the back of a score card. ""At my hotel at ten, then.""

""Then."" Someone lifted his eyes to praise him. His senses swam in
careful anticipation. They were cheering outside the dressing-room. A
different sound from the cheers at the fight-arena. Young, hilarious,
happy.

At ten he bent over the desk and was told to go to her room. The clerk
shrugged. She opened the door. One light was burning. There was perfume
in the air. She wore only a translucent kimono of pale-coloured silk.
She taught him a great many things that night. And Iris learned
something, too, so that she never came back to Hugo, and kept the
longing for him as a sort of memory which she made hallowed in a shorn
soul. It was, for her, a single asceticism in a rather selfish life.

Hugo loved her for two weeks after that, and then his emotions wearied
and he was able to see what she had done and why she did not answer his
letters. His subdued fierceness was a vehement fire to women. His
fiercer appetite was the cause of his early growth in a knowledge of
them. When most of his companions were finding their way into the
mysteries of sex both unhandily and with much turmoil, he learned well
and abnormally. It became a part of his secret self. Another barrier to
the level of the society that surrounded him. When he changed the name
of Iris to Isis in his thoughts, he moved away from the Psi Deltas, who
would have been incapable of the notion. In person he stayed among them,
but in spirit he felt another difference, which he struggled to
reconcile.

In March the thaws came, and under the warming sun Hugo made a
deliberate attempt to fall in love with Janice, who was the daughter of
his French professor. She was a happy, innocent little girl, with gold
hair, and brown eyes that lived oddly beneath it. She worshipped Hugo.
He petted her, talked through long evenings to her, tried to be faithful
to her in his most unfettered dreams, and once considered proposing to
her. When he found himself unable to do that, he was compelled to resist
an impulse to seduce her. Ashamed, believing himself unfit for a nice
girl, he untangled that romance as painlessly as he could, separating
himself from Janice little by little and denying every accusation of
waning interest.

Then for a month he believed that he could never be satisfied by any
woman, that he was superior to women. He read the lives of great lovers
and adulterers and he wished that he could see Bessie, who had taken his
money long before in New York City. She appealed to him then more than
all the others--probably, he thought, because he was drunk and had not
viewed her in sharp perspective. For hours he meditated on women, while
he longed constantly to possess a woman.

But the habitual routine of his life did not suffer. He attended his
classes and lectures, played on the basketball team, tried tentatively
to write for the campus newspaper, learned to perform indifferently on
the mandolin, and made himself into the semblance of an ideal college
man. His criticism of college then was at its lowest ebb. He spent
Christmas in New York at Lefty Foresman's parents' elaborate home,
slightly intoxicated through the two weeks, hastening to the opera, to
balls and parties, ill at ease when presented to people whose names
struck his ears familiarly, seeing for the first time the exaggeration
of scale on which the very rich live and wondering constantly why he
never met Iris, wishing for and fearing that meeting while he wondered.

When his first year at college was near to its end, and that still and
respectful silence that marks the passing of a senior class had fallen
over the campus, Hugo realized with a shock that he would soon be on his
way back to Indian Creek. Then, suddenly, he saw what an amazing and
splendid thing that year at college had been. He realized how it had
filled his life to the brim with activities of which he had not dreamed,
how it had shaped him so that he would be almost a stranger in his own
home, how it had aged and educated him in the business of living. When
the time of parting with his new friends drew near, he understood that
they were valuable to him, in spite of his questioning. And they made it
clear that he would be missed by them. At last he shared a feeling with
his classmates, a fond sadness, an illimitable poignancy that was young
and unadulterated by motive. He was perversely happy when he became
aware of it. He felt somewhat justified for being himself and living his
life.

A day or two before college closed, he received a letter from his
father. It was the third he had received during the year. It said:

     Dear Son--

     Your mother and I have decided to break the news to you before you
     leave for home, because there may be better opportunities for you
     in the East than here at Indian Creek. When you went away to
     Webster University, I agreed to take care of all your expenses. It
     was the least I could do, I felt, for my only son. The two thousand
     dollars your mother and I had saved seemed ample for your four
     years. But the bills we have received, as well as your own demands,
     have been staggering. In March, when a scant six hundred dollars of
     the original fund remained, I invested the money in a mine stock
     which, the salesman said, would easily net the six thousand dollars
     you appeared to need. I now find to my chagrin that the stock is
     worthless. I am unable to get back my purchase money.

     It will be impossible during the coming year for me to let you have
     more than five hundred dollars. Perhaps, with what you earn this
     summer and with the exercise of economy, you can get along. I trust
     so. But, anxious as we are to see you again, we felt that, in the
     light of such information, you might prefer to remain in the East
     to earn what you can.

     We are both despondent over the situation and we wish that we could
     do more than tender our regrets. But we hope that you will be able
     to find some solution to this situation. Thus, with our very
     warmest affection and our fondest hope, we wish you good fortune.

     Your loving father,

     ABEDNEGO DANNER.

Hugo read the letter down to the last period after the rather tremulous
signature. His emotions were confused. Touched by the earnest and
pathetically futile efforts of his father and by the attempt of that
lonely little man to express what was, perhaps, a great affection, Hugo
was nevertheless aghast at a prospect that he had not considered. He was
going to be thrown into the world on his own resources. And, resting his
frame in his worn chair--a frame capable of smashing into banks and
taking the needed money without fear of punishment--Hugo began to wonder
dismally if he was able even to support himself. No trade, no
occupation, suggested itself. He had already experienced some of the
merciless coldness of the world. The boys would all leave soon. And then
he would be alone, unprovided for, helpless.

Hugo was frightened. He read the letter again, his wistful thoughts of
his parents diminishing before the reality of his predicament. He
counted his money. Eighty dollars in the bank and twelve in his pockets.
He was glad he had started an account after his experience with Bessie.
He was glad that he had husbanded more than enough to pay his fare to
Indian Creek. Ninety-two dollars. He could live on that for a long time.
Perhaps for the summer. And he would be able to get some sort of job. He
was strong, anyway. That comforted him. He looked out of his window and
tried to enumerate the things that he could do. All sorts of farm work.
He could drive a team in the city. He could work on the docks. He
considered nothing but manual labor. It would offer more. Gradually his
fear that he would starve if left to his own devices ebbed from him, and
it was replaced by grief that he could not return to Webster. Fourteen
hundred dollars--that was the cost of his freshman year. He made a list
of the things he could do without, of the work he could do to help
himself through college. Perhaps he could return. The fear slowly
diminished. He would be a working student in the year to come. He hated
the idea. His fraternity had taken no members from that class of humble
young men who rose at dawn and scrubbed floors and waited on tables to
win the priceless gem of education. Lefty and Chuck would be chilly
toward such a step. They would even offer him money to avoid it. It was
a sad circumstance, at best.

When that period of tribulation passed, Hugo became a man. But he
suffered keenly from his unwonted fears for some time. The calm and
suave youth who had made love to Iris was buried beneath his frightened
and imaginative adolescence. It wore out the last of his childishness.
Immediately afterwards he learned about money and how it is earned. He
sat there in the dormitory, almost trembling with uncertainty and used
mighty efforts to do the things he felt he must do. He wrote a letter to
his father which began: ""Dear Dad--Why in Sam Hill didn't you tell me
you were being reamed so badly by your nit-witted son and I'd have
shovelled out and dug up some money for myself long ago?"" On rereading
that letter he realized that its tone was false. He wrote another in
which he apologized with simple sincerity for the condition he had
unknowingly created, and in which he expressed every confidence that he
could take care of himself in the future.

He bore that braver front through the last days of school. He shook
Lefty's hand warmly and looked fairly into his eyes. ""Well, so long, old
sock. Be good.""

""Be good, Hugo. And don't weaken. We'll need all your beef next year.
Decided what you're going to do yet?""

""No. Have you?""

Lefty shrugged. ""I suppose I've got to go abroad with the family as
usual. They wrote a dirty letter about the allowance I'd not have next
year if I didn't. Why don't you come with us? Iris'll be there.""

Hugo grinned. ""No, sir! Iris once is very nice, but no man's equal to
Iris twice."" His grin became a chuckle. ""And that's a poem which you can
say to Iris if you see her--and tell her I hope it makes her mad.""

Lefty's blue eyes sparkled with appreciation. Danner was a wonderful
boy. Full of wit and not dumb like most of his kind. Getting smooth,
too. Be a great man. Too bad to leave him--even for the summer.
""Well--so long, old man.""

Hugo watched Lefty lift his bags into a cab and roll away in the warm
June dust. Then Chuck:

""Well--by-by, Hugo. See you next September.""

""Yeah. Take care of yourself.""

""No chance of your going abroad, is there? Because we sure could paint
the old Avenue de l'Opéra red if you did.""

""Not this year, Chuck.""

""Well--don't take any wooden money.""

""Don't do anything you wouldn't eat.""

Hugo felt a lump in his throat. He could not say any more farewells. The
campus was almost deserted. No meals would be served after the next day.
He stared at the vacant dormitories and listened to the waning sound of
departures. A train puffed and fumed at the station. It was filled with
boys. Going away. He went to his room and packed. He'd leave, too. When
his suit-cases were filled, he looked round the room with damp eyes. He
thought that he was going to cry, mastered himself, and then did cry.
Some time later he remembered Iris and stopped crying. He walked to the
station, recalling his first journey in the other direction, his
pinch-backed green suit, the trunk he had carried. Grand old place,
Webster. Suddenly gone dead all over. There would be a train for New
York in half an hour. He took it. Some of the students talked to him on
the trip to the city. Then they left him, alone, in the great vacuum of
the terminal. The glittering corridors were filled with people. He
wondered if he could find Bessie's house.

At a restaurant he ate supper. When he emerged, it was dark. He asked
his way, found a hotel, registered in a one-dollar room, went out on the
street again. He walked to the Raven. Then he took a cab. He remembered
Bessie's house. An old woman answered the door. ""Bessie? Bessie? No girl
by that name I remember.""

Hugo described her. ""Oh, that tart! She ran out on me--owin' a week's
rent.""

""When was that?""

""Some time last fall.""

""Oh."" Hugo meditated. The woman spoke again. ""I did hear from one of my
other girls that she'd gone to work at Coney, but I ain't had time to
look her up. Owes me four dollars, she does. But Bessie, as you calls
her--her name's Sue--wasn't never much good. Still--"" the woman
scrutinized Hugo and giggled--""Bessie ain't the only girl in the world.
I got a cute little piece up here named Palmerlee says only the other
night she's lonely. Glad to interdooce you.""

Hugo thought of his small capital. ""No, thanks.""

He walked away. A warm moon was dimly sensible above the lights of the
street. He decided to go to Coney Island and look for the lost Bessie.
It would cost him only a dime, and she owed him money. He smiled a
little savagely and thought that he would collect its equivalent. Then
he boarded the subway, cursing himself for a fool and cursing his
appetite for the fool's master. Why did he chase that particular little
harlot on an evening when his mind should be bent toward more serious
purposes? Certainly not because he had any intention of getting back his
money. Because he wished to surprise her? Because he was angry that she
had cheated him? Or because she was the only woman in New York whom he
knew? He decided it was the last reason. Finally the train reached Coney
Island, and Hugo descended into the fantastic hurly-burly on the street
below. He realized the ridiculousness of his quest as he saw the miles
of thronging people in the loud streets.

""See the fat woman, see Esmerelda, the beautiful fat woman, she weighs
six hundred pounds, she's had a dozen lovers, she's the fattest woman in
the world, a sensation, dressed in the robes of Cleopatra, robes that
took a bolt of cloth; but she's so fat they conceal nothing, ladies and
gentlemen, see the beautiful fat woman...."" A roller coaster circled
through the skies with a noise that was audible above the crowd's
staccato voice and dashed itself at the earth below. A merry-go-round
whirled goldenly and a band struck up a strident march. Hugo smelled
stale beer and frying food. He heard the clang of a bell as a weight was
driven up to it by the shoulders of a young gentleman in a pink shirt.

""The strongest man in the world, ladies and gentlemen, come in and see
Thorndyke, the great professor of physical culture from Munich, Germany.
He can bend a spike in his bare hands, an elephant can pass over his
body without harming him, he can lift a weight of one ton...."" Hugo
laughed. Two girls saw him and brushed close. ""Buy us a drink, sport.""

The strongest man in the world. Hugo wondered what sort of strong man he
would make. Perhaps he could go into competition with Dr. Thorndyke. He
saw himself pictured in gaudy reds and yellows, holding up an enormous
weight. He remembered that he was looking for Bessie. Then he saw
another girl. She was sitting at a table, alone. That fact was
significant. He sat beside her.

""Hello, tough,"" she said.

""Hello.""

""Wanna buy me a beer?""

Hugo bought a beer and looked at the girl. Her hair was black and
straight. Her mouth was straight. It was painted scarlet. Her eyes were
hard and dark. But her body, as if to atone for her face, was made in a
series of soft curves that fitted exquisitely into her black silk dress.
He tortured himself looking at her. She permitted it sullenly. ""You can
buy me a sandwich, if you want. I ain't eaten to-day.""

He bought a sandwich, wondering if she was telling the truth. She ate
ravenously. He bought another and then a second glass of beer. After
that she rose. ""You can come with me if you wanna.""

Odd. No conversation, no vivacity, only a dull submission that was not
in keeping with her appearance.

""Have you had enough to eat?"" he asked.

""It'll do,"" she responded.

They turned into a side street and moved away from the shimmering lights
and the morass of people. Presently they entered a dingy frame house and
went upstairs. There was no one in the hall, no furniture, only a
flickering gas-light. She unlocked a door. ""Come in.""

He looked at her again. She took off her hat and arranged her dark hair
so that it looped almost over one eye. Hugo wondered at her silence. ""I
didn't mean to rush,"" he said.

""Well, I did. Gotta make some more. It'll be""--she hesitated--""two
bucks.""

The girl sat down and wept. ""Aw, hell,"" she said finally, looking at him
with a shameless defiance, ""I guess I'm gonna make a rotten tart. I was
in a show, an' I got busted out for not bein' nice to the manager. I
says to myself: 'Well, what am I gonna do?' An' I starts to get hungry
this morning. So I says to myself: 'Well, there ain't but one thing to
do, Charlotte, but to get you a room,' I says, an' here I am, so help me
God.""

She removed her dress with a sweeping motion. Hugo looked at her, filled
with pity, filled with remorse at his sudden surrender to her passionate
good looks, intensely discomfited.

""Listen. I have a roll in my pocket. I'm damn glad I came here first. I
haven't got a job, but I'll get one in the morning. And I'll get you a
decent room and stake you till you get work. God knows, I picked you up
for what I thought you were, Charlotte, and God knows too that I haven't
any noble nature. But I'm not going to let you go on the street simply
because you're broke. Not when you hate it so much.""

Charlotte shut her eyes tight and pressed out the last tears, which ran
into her rouge and streaked it with mascara. ""That's sure white of you.""

""I don't know. Maybe it's selfish. I had an awful yen for you when I sat
down at that table. But let's not worry about it now. Let's go out and
get a decent dinner.""

""You mean--you mean you want me to go out and eat--now?""

""Sure. Why not?""

""But you ain't--?""

""Forget it. Come on.""

Charlotte sniffled and buried her black tresses in her black dress. She
pulled it over the curves of her hips. She inspected herself in a
spotted mirror and sniffled again. Then she laughed. A throaty, gurgling
laugh. Her hands moved swiftly, and soon she turned. ""How am I?""

""Wonderful.""

""Let's go!""

She tucked her hand under his arm when they reached the street. Hugo
walked silently. He wondered why he was doing it and to what it would
lead. It seemed good, wholly good, to have a girl at his side again,
especially a girl over whom he had so strong a claim. They stopped
before a glass-fronted restaurant that advertised its sea food and its
steaks. She sat down with an apologetic smile. ""I'm afraid I'm goin' to
eat you out of house and home.""

""Go ahead. I had a big supper, but I'll string along with some pie and
cheese and beer.""

Charlotte studied the menu. ""Mind if I have a little steak?""

Hugo shook his head slowly. ""Waiter! A big T-bone, and some lyonnaise
potatoes, and some string beans and corn and a salad and ice cream.
Bring some pie and cheese for me--and a beer.""

""Gosh!"" Charlotte said.

Hugo watched her eat the food. He knew such pity as he had seldom felt.
Poor little kid! All alone, scared, going on the street because she
would starve otherwise. It made him feel strong and capable. Before the
meal was finished, she was talking furiously. Her pathetic life was
unravelled. ""I come from Brooklyn ... old man took to drink, an' ma beat
it with a gent from Astoria ... never knew what happened to her.... I
kept house for the old man till he tried to get funny with me....
Burlesque ... on the road ... the leading man.... He flew the coop when
I told him, and then when it came, it was dead...."" Another job ... the
manager ... Coney and her dismissal. ""I just couldn't let 'em have it
when I didn't like 'em, mister. Guess I'm not tough like the other
girls. My mother was French and she brought me up kind of decent.
Well...."" The little outward turning of her hands, the shrug of her
shoulders.

""Don't worry, Charlotte. I won't let them eat you. To-morrow I'll set
you up to a decent room and we'll go out and find some jobs here.""

""You don't have to do that, mister. I'll make out. All I needed was a
square and another day.""

Charlotte sighed and smoked a cigarette with her coffee. Then they went
out on the street and mixed with the throng. The voices of a score of
barkers wheedled them. Hugo began to feel gay. He took Charlotte to see
the strong man and watched his feats with a critical eye. He took her on
the roller coaster and became taut and laughing when she screamed and
held him. Then, laughing louder than before, they went through
Steeplechase. She fell in the rolling barrel and he carried her out.
They crossed over moving staircases and lost themselves in a maze, and
slid down polished chutes into fountains of light and excited screaming.
Always, afterwards, her hand found his arm, her great dark eyes looked
into his and laughed. Always they turned toward the other men and girls
with a proud and haughty expression that pointed to Hugo as her man, her
conquest. Later they danced. They drank more beer.

""Golly,"" she whispered, as she snuggled against him, ""you sure strut a
mean fox trot.""

""So do you, Charlotte.""

""I been doin' it a lot, I guess.""

The brazen crash of a finale. The table. A babble of voices, voices of
people snatching pleasure from Coney Island's gaudy barrel of cheap
amusements. Hugo liked it then. He liked the smell and touch of the
multitude and the incessant hysteria of its presence. After midnight the
music became more aggravating--muted, insinuating. Several of the
dancers were drunk. One of them tried to cut in. Hugo shook his head.

""Gee!"" Charlotte said, ""I was sure hopin' you wouldn't let him.""

""Why--I never thought of it.""

""Most fellows would. He's a tough.""

It was an introduction to an unfamiliar world. The ""tough"" came to their
table and asked for a dance in thick accents. Charlotte paled and
accepted. Hugo refused. ""Say, bo, I'm askin' for a dance. I got
concessions here. You can't refuse me, see? I guess you got me wrong.""

""Beat it,"" Hugo said, ""before I take a poke at you.""

The intruder's answer was a swinging fist, which missed Hugo by a wide
margin. Hugo stood and dropped him with a single clean blow. The manager
came up, expostulated, ordered the tough's inert form from the floor,
started the music.

""You shouldn't ought to have done it, mister. He'll get his gang.""

""The hell with his gang.""

Charlotte sighed. ""That's the first time anybody ever stuck up for me.
Jeest, mister, I've been wishin' an' wishin' for the day when somebody
would bruise his knuckles for me.""

Hugo laughed. ""Hey, waiter! Two beers.""

When she yawned, he took her out to the boulevard and walked at her side
toward the shabby house. They reached the steps, and Charlotte began to
cry.

""What's the matter?""

""I was goin' to thank you, but I don't know how. It was too nice of you.
An' now I suppose I'll never see you again.""

""Don't be silly. I'll show up at eight in the morning and we'll have
breakfast together.""

Charlotte looked into his face wistfully. ""Say, kid, be a good guy and
take me to your hotel, will you? I'm scared I'll lose you.""

He held her hands. ""You won't lose me. And I haven't got a hotel--yet.""

""Then--come up an' stay with me. Honest, I'm all right. I can prove it
to you. It'll be doin' me a favor.""

""I ought not to, Charlotte.""

She threw her arms around him and kissed him. He felt her breath on his
lips and the warmth of her body. ""You gotta, kid. You're all I ever had.
Please, please.""

Hugo walked up the stairs thoughtfully. In her small room he watched her
disrobe. So willingly now--so eagerly. She turned back the covers of the
bed. ""It ain't much of a dump, baby, but I'll make you like it.""

Much later, in the abyss of darkness, he heard her voice, sleepy and
still husky. ""Say, mister, what's your name?""

In the morning they went down to the boulevard together. The gay débris
of the night before lay in the street, and men were sweeping it away.
But their spirits were high. They had breakfast together in a quiet
enchantment. Once she kissed him.

""Would you like to keep house--for me?"" he asked.

""Do you mean it?"" She seemed to doubt every instant that good fortune
had descended permanently upon her. She was like a dreamer who
anticipated a sombre awakening even while he clung to the bliss of his
dream.

""Sure, I mean it. I'll get a job and we'll find an apartment and you can
spend your spare time swimming and lying on the beach."" He knew a twinge
of unexpected jealousy. ""That is, if you'll promise not to look at all
the men who are going to look at you."" He was ashamed of that statement.

Charlotte, however, was not sufficiently civilized to be displeased. ""Do
you think I'd two-time the first gent that ever worried about what I did
in my spare moments? Why, if you brought home a few bucks to most of the
birds I know, they wouldn't even ask how you earned it--they'd be so
busy lookin' for another girl an' a shot of gin.""

""Well--let's go.""

Hugo went to one of the largest side shows. After some questioning he
found the manager. ""I'm H. Smith,"" he said, ""and I want to apply for a
job.""

""Doin' what?""

""This is my wife."" The manager stared and nodded. Charlotte took his arm
and rubbed it against herself, thinking, perhaps, that it was a wifely
gesture. Hugo smiled inwardly and then looked at the sprawled form of
the manager. There, to that seamy-faced and dour man who was almost
unlike a human being, he was going to offer the first sale of his
majestic strength. A side-show manager, sitting behind a dirty desk in a
dirty building.

""A strong-man act,"" Hugo said.

Charlotte tittered. She thought that the bravado of her new friend was
over-stepping the limits of good sense. The manager sat up. ""I'd like to
have a good strong man, yes. The show needs one. But you're not the
bird. You haven't got the beef. Go over and watch that damned German
work.""

Hugo bent over and fastened one hand on the back of the chair on which
the manager sat. Without evidence of effort he lifted the chair and its
occupant high over his head.

""For Christ's sake, let me down,"" the manager said.

Hugo swung him through the air in a wide arc. ""I say, mister, that I'm
three times stronger than that German. And I want your job. If I don't
look strong enough, I'll wear some padded tights. And I'll give you a
show that'll be worth the admission. But I want a slice of the entrance
price--and maybe a separate tent, see? My name is Hogarth""--he winked at
Charlotte--""and you'll never be sorry you took me on.""

The manager, panting and astonished, was returned to the floor. His
anger struggled with his pleasure at Hugo's showmanship. ""Well, what
else can you do? Weight-lifting is pretty stale.""

Hugo thought quickly. ""I can bend a railroad rail--not a spike. I can
lift a full-grown horse with one--one shoulder. I can chin myself on my
little finger. I can set a bear trap with my teeth--""

""That's a good number.""

""I can push up just twice as much weight as any one else in the game and
you can print a challenge on my tent. I can pull a boa constrictor
straight--""

""We'll give you a chance. Come around here at three this afternoon with
your stuff and we'll try your act. Does this lady work in it? That'll
help.""

""Yes,"" Charlotte said.

Hugo nodded. ""She's my assistant.""

They left the building, and when she was sure they were out of earshot,
Charlotte said: ""What do you do, strong boy, fake 'em?""

""No. I do them.""

""Aw--you don't need to kid me.""

""I'm not. You saw me lift him, didn't you? Well--that was nothing.""

""Jeest! That I should live to see the day I got a bird like you.""

Until three o'clock Hugo and Charlotte occupied their time with feverish
activity. They found a small apartment not far from the sea-shore. It
was clean and bright and it had windows on two sides. Its furniture was
nearly new, and Charlotte, with tears in her eyes, sat in all the
chairs, lay on the bed, took the egg-beater from the drawer in the
kitchen table and spun it in an empty bowl. They went out together and
bought a quantity and a variety of food. They ate an early luncheon and
Hugo set out to gather the properties for his demonstration. At three
o'clock, before a dozen men, he gave an exhibition of strength the like
of which had never been seen in any museum of human abnormalities.

When he went back to his apartment, Charlotte, in a gingham dress which
she had bought with part of the money he had given her, was preparing
dinner. He took her on his lap. ""Did you get the job?""

""Sure I did. Fifty a week and ten per cent of the gate receipts.""

""Gee! That's a lot of money!""

Hugo nodded and kissed her. He was very happy. Happier, in a certain
way, than he had ever been or ever would be again. His livelihood was
assured. He was going to live with a woman, to have one always near to
love and to share his life. It was that concept of companionship, above
all other things, which made him glad.

Two days later, as Hugo worked to prepare the vehicles of his
exhibition, he heard an altercation outside the tent that had been
erected for him. A voice said: ""Whatcha tryin' to do there, anyhow?""

""Why, I was making this strong man as I saw him. A man with the
expression of strength in his face.""

""But you gotta bat' robe on him. What we want is muscles. Muscles, bo.
Bigger an' better than any picture of any strong man ever made. Put one
here--an' one there--""

""But that isn't correct anatomy.""

""To hell wit' that stuff. Put one there, I says.""

""But he'll be out of drawing, awkward, absurd.""

""Say, listen, do you want ten bucks for painting this sign or shall I
give it to some one else?""

""Very well. I'll do as you say. Only--it isn't right.""

Hugo walked out of the tent. A young man was bending over a huge sheet
made of many lengths of oilcloth sewn together. He was a small person,
with pale eyes and a white skin. Beside him stood the manager, eyeing
critically the strokes applied to the cloth. In a semi-finished state
was the young man's picture of the imaginary Hogarth.

""That's pretty good,"" Hugo said.

The young man smiled apologetically. ""It isn't quite right. You can see
for yourself you have no muscles there--and there. I suppose you're
Hogarth?""

""Yes.""

""Well--I tried to explain the anatomy of it, but Mr. Smoots says anatomy
doesn't matter. So here we go."" He made a broad orange streak.

Hugo smiled. ""Smoots is not an anatomical critic of any renown. I say,
Smoots, let him paint it as he sees best. God knows the other posters
are atrocious enough.""

The youth looked up from his work. ""Good God, don't tell me you're
really Hogarth!""

""Sure. Why not?""

""Well--well--I--I guess it was your English.""

""That's funny. And I don't blame you."" Hugo realized that the young
sign-painter was a person of some culture. He was about Hugo's age,
although he seemed younger on first glance. ""As a matter of fact, I'm a
college man."" Smoots had moved away. ""But, for the love of God, don't
tell any one around here.""

The painter stopped. ""Is that so! And you're doing this--to make money?""

""Yes.""

""Well, I'll be doggoned. Me, too. I study at the School of Design in the
winter, and in the summer I come out here to do signs and lightning
portraits and whatever else I can to make the money for it. Sometimes,""
he added, ""I pick up more than a thousand bucks in a season. This is my
fourth year at it.""

There was in the young artist's eye a hint of amusement, a suggestion
that they were in league. Hugo liked him. He sat down on a box. ""Live
here?""

""Yes. Three blocks away.""

""Me, too. Why not come up and have supper with--my wife and me?""

""Are you married?"" The artist commenced work again.

Hugo hesitated. ""Yeah.""

""Sure I'll come up. My name's Valentine Mitchel. I can't shake hands
just now. It's been a long time since I've talked to any one who doesn't
say 'deez' and 'doze.'""

When, later in the day, they walked toward Hugo's home, he was at a loss
to explain Charlotte. The young painter would not understand why he, a
college man, chose so ignorant a mate. On the other hand, he owed it to
Charlotte to keep their secret and he was not obliged to make any
explanation.

Valentine Mitchel was, however, a young man of some sensitivity. If he
winced at Charlotte's ""Pleased to meetcher,"" he did not show it. Later,
after an excellent and hilarious meal, he must have guessed the
situation. He went home reluctantly and Hugo was delighted with him. He
had been urbane and filled with anecdotes of Greenwich Village and
art-school life, of Paris, whither his struggling footsteps had taken
him for a hallowed year. And with his acceptance of Hugo came an equally
warm pleasure in Charlotte's company.

""He's a good little kid,"" Charlotte said.

""Yes. I'm glad I picked him up.""

The gala opening of Hogarth's Studio of Strength took place a few nights
afterwards. It proved even more successful than Smoots had hoped. The
flamboyant advertising posters attracted crowds to see the man who could
set a bear trap with his teeth, who could pull an angry boa constrictor
into a straight line. Before ranks of gaping faces that were supplanted
by new ranks every hour, Hugo performed. Charlotte, resplendent in a
black dress that left her knees bare, and a red sash that all but
obliterated the dress, helped Hugo with his ponderous props, setting off
his strength by contrast, and sold the pamphlets Hugo had written at
Smoots's suggestion--pamphlets that purported to give away the secret
of Hogarth's phenomenal muscle power. Valentine Mitchel watched the
entire performance.

When it was over, he said to Hugo: ""Now you better beat it back and get
a hot bath. You're probably all in.""

""Yes,"" Charlotte said. ""Come. I myself will bathe you.""

Hugo grinned. ""Hell, no. Now we're all going on a bender to celebrate.
We'll eat at Villapigue's and we'll take a moonlight sail.""

They went together, marvelling at his vitality, gay, young, and living
in a world that they managed to forget did not exist. The night was
warm. The days that followed were warmer. The crowds came and the brassy
music hooted and coughed over them night and day.

There are, in the lives of almost every man and woman, certain brief
episodes that, enduring for a long or a short time, leave in the memory
a sense of completeness. To those moments humanity returns for refuge,
for courage, and for solace. It was of such material that Hugo's next
two months were composed. The items of it were nearly all sensuous: the
sound of the sea when he sat in the sand late at night with Charlotte;
the whoop and bellow of the merry-go-round that spun and glittered
across the street from his tent; the inarticulate breathing and the
white-knuckled clenchings of the crowd as it lifted its face to his
efforts, for each of which he assumed a slow, painful motion that
exaggerated its difficulty; the smell of the sea, intermingled with a
thousand man-made odors; the faint, pervasive scent of Charlotte that
clung to him, his clothes, his house; the pageant of the people, always
in a huge parade, going nowhere, celebrating nothing but the functions
of living, loud, garish, cheap, splendid; breakfasts at his table with
his woman's voluptuousness abated in the bright sunlight to little more
than a reminiscence and a promise; the taste of beer and pop-corn and
frankfurters and lobster and steak; the affable, talkative company of
Valentine Mitchel.

Only once that he could recall afterwards did he allow his intellect to
act in any critical direction, and that was in a conversation with the
young artist. They were sitting together in the sand, and Charlotte,
browned by weeks of bathing, lay near by. ""Here I am,"" Mitchel said with
an unusual thoughtfulness, ""with a talent that should be recognized,
wanting to be an illustrator, able to be one, and yet forced to dawdle
with this horrible business to make my living.""

Hugo nodded. ""You'll come through--some winter--and you won't ever
return to Coney Island.""

""I know it. Unless I do it for sentimental reasons some day--in a
limousine.""

""It's myself,"" Hugo said then, ""and not you who is doomed to--well, to
this sort of thing. You have a talent that is at least understandable
and--"" he was going to say mediocre. He checked himself--""applicable in
the world of human affairs. My talent--if it is a talent--has no place,
no application, no audience.""

Mitchel stared at Hugo, wondering first what that talent might be and
then recognizing that Hugo meant his strength. ""Nonsense. Any male in
his right senses would give all his wits to be as strong as you are.""

It was a polite, friendly thing to say. Hugo could not refrain from
comparing himself to Valentine Mitchel. An artist--a clever artist and
one who would some day be important to the world. Because people could
understand what he drew, because it represented a level of thought and
expression. He was, like Hugo, in the doldrums of progress. But Mitchel
would emerge, succeed, be happy--or at least satisfied with
himself--while Hugo was bound to silence, was compelled never to allow
himself full expression. Humanity would never accept and understand him.
They were not similar people, but their case was, at that instant,
ironically parallel. ""It isn't only being strong,"" he answered
meditatively, ""but it's knowing what to do with your strength.""

""Why--there are a thousand things to do.""

""Such as?""

Mitchel raised himself on his elbows and turned his water-coloured eyes
on the populous beach. ""Well--well--let's see. You could, of course, be
a strong man and amuse people--which you're doing. You could--oh, there
are lots of things you could do.""

Hugo smiled. ""I've been thinking about them--for years. And I can't
discover any that are worth the effort.""

""Bosh!""

Charlotte moved close to him. ""There's one thing you can do, honey, and
that's enough for me.""

""I wonder,"" Hugo said with a seriousness the other two did not perceive.

The increased heat of August suggested by its very intensity a shortness
of duration, an end of summer. Hugo began to wonder what he would do
with Charlotte when he went back to Webster. He worried about her a good
deal and she, guessing the subject of his frequent fits of silence, made
a resolve in her tough and worldly mind. She had learned more about
certain facets of Hugo than he knew himself. She realized that he was
superior to her and that, in almost any other place than Coney Island,
she would be a liability to him. The thought that he would have to
desert her made Hugo very miserable. He knew that he would miss
Charlotte and he knew that the blow to her might spell disaster. After
all, he thought, he had not improved her morals or raised her vision. He
did not realize that he had made both almost sublime by the mere act of
being considerate. ""White,"" Charlotte called it.

Nevertheless she was not without an intense sense of self-protection,
despite her condition on the night he had found her. She knew that
womankind lived at the expense of mankind. She saw the emotional
respect in which Valentine Mitchel unwittingly held Hugo. He had
scarcely spoken ten serious words to her. She realized that the artist
saw her as a property of his friend. That, in a way, made her valuable.
It was a subtle advantage, which she pressed with all the skill it
required. One night when Hugo was at work and the chill of autumn had
breathed on the hot shore, she told Valentine that he was a very nice
boy and that she liked him very much. He went away distraught, which was
what she had intended, and he carried with him a new and as yet
inarticulate idea, which was what she had foreseen.

He believed that he loved her. He told himself that Hugo was going to
desert her, that she would be forsaken and alone. At that point, she
recited to him the story of her life and the tale of her rescue by Hugo
and said at the end that she would be very lonely when Hugo was gone.
Because Hugo had loved her, Mitchel thought she contained depths and
values which did not appear. That she contained such depths neither man
really knew then. Both of them learned it much later. Mitchel found
himself in that very artistic dilemma of being in love with his friend's
mistress. It terrified his romantic soul and it involved him
inextricably.

When she felt that the situation had ripened to the point of action, she
waited for the precise moment. It came swiftly and in a better guise
than she had hoped. On a night in early September, when the crowds had
thinned a little, Hugo was just buckling himself into the harness that
lifted the horse. The spectators were waiting for the dénouement with
bickering patience. Charlotte was standing on the platform, watching him
with expressionless eyes. She knew that soon she would not see Hugo any
more. She knew that he was tired of his small show, that he was chafing
to be gone; and she knew that his loyalty to her would never let him go
unless it was made inevitable by her. The horse was ready. She watched
the muscles start out beneath Hugo's tawny skin. She saw his lips set,
his head thrust back. She worshipped him like that. Unemotionally, she
saw the horse lifted up from the floor. She heard the applause. There
was a bustle at the gate.

Half a dozen people entered in single file. Three young men. Three
girls. They were intoxicated. They laughed and spoke in loud voices. She
saw by their clothes and their manner that they were rich. Slumming in
Coney Island. She smiled at the young men as she had always smiled at
such young men, friendlily, impersonally. Hugo did not see their
entrance. They came very near.

""My God, it's Hugo Danner!""

Hugo heard Lefty's voice and recognized it. The horse was dropped to the
floor. He turned. An expression of startled amazement crossed his
features. Chuck, Lefty, Iris, and three people whom he did not know were
staring at him. He saw the stupefied recognition on the faces of his
friends. One despairing glance he cast at Charlotte and then he went on
with his act.

They waited for him until it was over. They clasped him to their bosoms.
They acknowledged Charlotte with critical glances. ""Come on and join the
party,"" they said.

After that, their silence was worse than any questions. They talked
freely and merrily enough, but behind their words was a deep reserve.
Lefty broke it when he had an opportunity to take Hugo aside. ""What in
hell is eating you? Aren't you coming back to Webster?""

""Sure. That is--I think so. I had to do this to make some money. Just
about the time school closed, my family went broke.""

""But, good God, man, why didn't you tell us? My father is an alumnus and
he'd put up five thousand a year, if necessary, to see you kept on the
football team.""

Hugo laughed. ""You don't think I'd take it, Lefty?""

""Why not?"" A pause. ""No, I suppose you'd be just the God-damned kind of
a fool that wouldn't. Who's the girl?""

Hugo did not falter. ""She's a tart I've been living with. I never knew a
better one--girl, that is.""

""Have you gone crazy?""

""On the contrary, I've got wise.""

""Well, for Christ's sake, don't say anything about it on the campus.""

Hugo bit his lip. ""Don't worry. My business is--my own.""

They joined the others, drinking at the table. Charlotte was telling a
joke. It was not a nice joke. He had not thought of her jokes
before--because Iris and Chuck and Lefty had not been listening to them.
Now, he was embarrassed. Iris asked him to dance with her. They went out
on the floor.

""Lovely little thing, that Charlotte,"" she said acidly.

""Isn't she!"" Hugo answered with such enthusiasm that she did not speak
during the rest of the dance.

Finally the ordeal ended. Lefty and his guests embarked in an automobile
for the city.

""You know such people,"" Charlotte half-whispered. Hugo's cheeks still
flamed, but his heart bled for her.

""I guess they aren't much,"" he replied.

She answered hotly: ""Don't you be like that! They're nice people.
They're fine people. That Iris even asked me to her house. Gave me a
card to see her."" Charlotte could guess what Iris wanted. So could Hugo.
But Charlotte pretended to be innocent.

He kissed Charlotte good-night and walked in the streets until morning.
Hugo could see no solution. Charlotte was so trusting, so good to him.
He could not imagine how she would receive any suggestion that she go to
New York and get a job, while he returned to college, that he see her
during vacations, that he send money to her. But he knew that a hot
fire dwelt within her and that her fury would rise, her grief, and that
he would be made very miserable and ashamed. She chided him at breakfast
for his walk in the dark. She laughed and kissed him and pushed him
bodily to his work. He looked back as he walked down to the curb. She
was leaning out of the window. She waved her hand. He rounded the corner
with wretched, leaden steps. The morning, concerned with the petty
business of receipts, refurbishings, cleaning, went slowly. When he
returned for lunch it was with the decision to tell her the truth about
his life and its requirements and to let her decide.

She did not come to the door to kiss him. (She had imagined that lonely
return.) She did not answer his brave and cheerful hail. (She had let
the sound of it ring upon her ear a thousand times.) She was gone. (She
knew he would sit down and cry.) Then, stumbling, he found the two
notes. But he already understood.

The message from Valentine Mitchel was reckless, impetuous. ""Dear
Hugo--Charlotte and I have fallen in love with each other and I've run
away with her. I almost wish you'd come after us and kill me. I hate
myself for betraying you. But I love her, so I cannot help it. I've
learned to see in her what you first saw in her. Good-bye, good luck.""

Hugo put it down. Charlotte would be good to him. In a way, he didn't
deserve her. And when he was famous, some day, perhaps she would leave
him, too. He hesitated to read her note. ""Good-bye, darling, I do not
love you any more. C.""

It was ludicrous, transparent, pitiful, and heroic. Hugo saw all those
qualities. ""Good-bye, darling, I do not love you any more."" She had
written it under Valentine's eyes. But she was shrewd enough to placate
her new lover while she told her sad little story to her old. She would
want him to feel bad. Well, God knew, he did. Hugo looked at the room.
He sobbed. He bolted into the street, tears streaming down his cheeks;
he drew his savings from the bank--seven hundred and eighty-four dollars
and sixty-four cents; he rushed to the haunted house, flung his clothes
into a bag; he sat drearily on a subway for an hour. He paced the smooth
floor of a station. He swung aboard a train. He came to Webster, his
head high, feeling a great pride in Charlotte and in his love for her,
walking in glad strides over the familiar soil.




IX


Hugo sat alone and marvelled at the exquisite torment of his
_Weltschmertz_. Far away, across the campus, he heard singing. Against
the square segment of sky visible from the bay window of his room he
could see the light of the great fire they had built to celebrate
victory--his victory. The light leaped into the darkness above like a
great golden ghost in some fantastic ascension, and beneath it, he knew,
a thousand students were dancing. They were druid priests at a rite to
the god of football. His fingers struggled through his black hair. The
day was fresh in his mind--the bellowing stands, the taut, almost
frightened faces of the eleven men who faced him, the smack and flight
of the brown oval, the lumbering sound of men running, the sucking of
the breath of men and their sharp, painful fall to earth.

In his mind was a sharp picture of himself and the eyes that watched him
as he broke away time and again, with infantile ease, to carry that
precious ball. He let them make a touchdown that he could have averted.
He made one himself. Then another. The bell on Webster Hall was booming
its pæan of victory. He stiffened under the steady monody. He remembered
again. Lefty barking signals with a strange agony in his voice. Lefty
pounding on his shoulder. ""Go in there, Hugo, and give it to them. I
can't."" Lefty pleading. And the captain, Jerry Painter, cursing in open
jealousy of Hugo, vying hopelessly with Hugo Danner, the man who was a
god.

It was not fair. Not right. The old and early glory was ebbing from it.
When he put down the ball, safely across the goal for the winning
touchdown, he saw three of the men on the opposing team lie down and
weep. There he stood, pretending to pant, feigning physical distress,
making himself a hero at the expense of innocent victims. Jackstraws for
a giant. There was no triumph in that. He could not go on.

Afterwards they had made him speak, and the breathless words that had
once come so easily moved heavily through his mind. Yet he had carried
his advantage beyond the point of turning back. He could not say that
the opponents of Webster might as well attempt to hold back a
Juggernaut, to throw down a siege-gun, to outrace light, as to lay their
hands on him to check his intent. Webster had been good to him. He loved
Webster and it deserved his best. His best! He peered again into the
celebrating night and wondered what that awful best would be.

He desired passionately to be able to give that--to cover the earth,
making men glad and bringing a revolution into their lives, to work
himself into a fury and to fatigue his incredible sinews, to end with
the feeling of a race well run, a task nobly executed. And, for a year,
that ambition had seemed in some small way to be approaching fruition.
Now it was turned to ashes. It was not with the muscles of men that his
goal was to be attained. They could not oppose him.

As he sat gloomy and distressed, he wondered for what reason there
burned in him that wish to do great deeds. Humanity itself was too
selfish and too ignorant to care. It could boil in its tiny prejudices
for centuries to come and never know that there could be a difference.
Moreover, who was he to grind his soul and beat his thoughts for the
benefit of people who would never know and never care? What honour, when
he was dead, to lie beneath a slab on which was punily graven some note
of mighty accomplishment? Why could he not content himself with the food
he ate, the sunshine, with wind in trees, and cold water, and a woman?
It was that sad and silly command within to transcend his vegetable self
that made him human. He tried to think about it bitterly: fool man,
grown suddenly more conscious than the other beasts--how quickly he had
become vain because of it and how that vanity led him forever onward! Or
was it vanity--when his aching soul proclaimed that he would gladly
achieve and die without other recognition or acclaim than that which
rose within himself? Martyrs were made of such stuff. And was not that,
perhaps, an even more exaggerated vanity? It was so pitiful to be a man
and nothing more. Hugo bowed his head and let his body tremble with
strange agony. Perhaps, he thought, even the agony was a selfish
pleasure to him. Then he should be ashamed. He felt shame and then
thought that the feeling rose from a wish for it and foundered angrily
in the confusion of his introspection. He knew only and knew but dimly
that he would lift himself up again and go on, searching for some
universal foe to match against his strength. So pitiful to be a man! So
Christ must have felt in Gethsemane.

""Hey, Hugo!""

""Yeah?""

""What the hell did you come over here for?""

""To be alone.""

""Is that a hint?"" Lefty entered the room. ""They want you over at the
bonfire. We've been looking all over for you.""

""All right. I'll go. But, honest to God, I've had enough of this
business for to-day.""

Lefty slapped Hugo's shoulders. ""The great must pay for their celebrity.
Come on, you sap.""

""All right.""

""What's the matter? Anything the matter?""

""No. Nothing's the matter. Only--it's sort of sad to be--"" Hugo checked
himself.

""Sad? Good God, man, you're going stale.""

""Maybe that's it."" Hugo had a sudden fancy. ""Do you suppose I could be
let out of next week's game?""

""What for? My God--""

Hugo pursued the idea. ""It's the last game. I can sit on the lines. You
fellows all play good ball. You can probably win. If you can't--then
I'll play. If you only knew, Lefty, how tired I get sometimes--""

""Tired! Why don't you say something about it? You can lay off practice
for three or four days.""

""Not that. Tired in the head, not the body. Tired of crashing through
and always getting away with it. Oh, I'm not conceited. But I know they
can't stop me. You know it. It's a gift of mine--and a curse. How about
it? Let's start next week without me.""

The night ended at last. A new day came. The bell on Webster Hall
stopped booming. Woodie, the coach, came to see Hugo between classes.
""Lefty says you want us to start without you next week. What's the big
idea?""

""I don't know. I thought the other birds would like a shot at Yale
without me. They can do it.""

Mr. Woodman eyed his player. ""That's pretty generous of you, Hugo. Is
there any other reason?""

""Not--that I can explain.""

""I see."" The coach offered Hugo a cigarette after he had helped himself.
""Take it. It'll do you good.""

""Thanks.""

""Listen, Hugo. I want to ask you a question. But, first, I want you to
promise you'll give me a plain answer.""

""I'll try.""

""That won't do.""

""Well--I can't promise.""

Woodman sighed. ""I'll ask it anyway. You can answer or not--just as you
wish."" He was silent. He inhaled his cigarette and blew the smoke
through his nostrils. His eyes rested on Hugo with an expression of
intense interest, beneath which was a softer light of something not
unlike sympathy. ""I'll have to tell you something, first, Hugo. When you
went away last summer, I took a trip to Colorado.""

Hugo started, and Woodman continued: ""To Indian Creek. I met your father
and your mother. I told them that I knew you. I did my best to gain
their confidence. You see, Hugo, I've watched you with a more skilful
eye than most people. I've seen you do things, a few little things, that
weren't--well--that weren't--""

Hugo's throat was dry. ""Natural?""

""That's the best word, I guess. You were never like my other boys, in
any case. So I thought I'd find out what I could. I must admit that my
efforts with your father were a failure. Aside from the fact that he is
an able biology teacher and that he had a number of queer theories years
ago, I learned nothing. But I did find out what those theories were. Do
you want me to stop?""

A peculiar, almost hopeful expression was on Hugo's face. ""No,"" he
answered.

""Well, they had to do with the biochemistry of cellular structure,
didn't they? And with the production of energy in cells? And then--I
talked to lots of people. I heard about Samson.""

""Samson!"" Hugo echoed, as if the dead had spoken.

""Samson--the cat.""

Hugo was as pale as chalk. His eyes burned darkly. He felt that his
universe was slipping from beneath him. ""You know, then,"" he said.

""I don't know, Hugo. I merely guessed. I was going to ask. Now I shall
not. Perhaps I do know. But I had another question, son--""

""Yes?"" Hugo looked at Woodman and felt then the reason for his success
as a coach, as a leader and master of youth. He understood it.

""Well, I wondered if you thought it was worth while to talk to your
father and discover--""

""What he did?"" Hugo suggested hoarsely.

Woodman put his hand on Hugo's knee. ""What he did, son. You ought to
know by this time what it means. I've been watching you. I don't want
your head to swell, but you're a great boy, Hugo. Not only in beef. You
have a brain and an imagination and a sense of moral responsibility.
You'll come out better than the rest--you would even without your--your
particular talent. And I thought you might think that the rest of
humanity would profit--""

Hugo jumped to his feet. ""No. A thousand times no. For the love of
Christ--no! You don't know or understand, you can't conceive, Woodie,
what it means to have it. You don't have the faintest idea of its
amount--what it tempts you with--what they did to me and I did to myself
to beat it--if I have beaten it."" He laughed. ""Listen, Woodie. Anything
I want is mine. Anything I desire I can take. No one can hinder. And
sometimes I sweat all night for fear some day I shall lose my temper.
There's a desire in me to break and destroy and wreck that--oh, hell--""

Woodman waited. Then he spoke quietly. ""You're sure, Hugo, that the
desire to be the only one--like that--has nothing to do with it?""

Hugo's sole response was to look into Woodman's eyes, a look so pregnant
with meaning, so tortured, so humble, that the coach swore softly. Then
he held out his hand. ""Well, Hugo, that's all. You've been damn swell
about it. The way I hoped you would be. And I think my answer is plain.
One thing. As long as I live, I promise on my oath I'll never give you
away or support any rumour that hurts your secret.""

Even Hugo was stirred to a consciousness of the strength of the other
man's grip.

Saturday. A shrill whistle. The thump of leather against leather. The
roar of the stadium.

Hugo leaned forward. He watched his fellows from the bench. They rushed
across the field. Lefty caught the ball. Eddie Carter interfered with
the first man, Bimbo Gaines with the second. The third slammed Lefty
against the earth. Three downs. Eight yards. A kick. New Haven brought
the ball to its twenty-one-yard line. The men in helmets formed again. A
coughing voice. Pandemonium. Again in line. The voice. The riot of
figures suddenly still. Again. A kick. Lefty with the ball, and Bimbo
Gaines leading him, his big body a shield. Down. A break and a run for
twenty-eight yards. Must have been Chuck. Good old Chuck. He'd be
playing the game of his life. Graduation next spring. Four, seven,
eleven, thirty-two, fifty-five. Hugo anticipated the spreading of the
players. He looked where the ball would be thrown. He watched Minton,
the end, spring forward, saw him falter, saw the opposing quarterback
run in, saw Lefty thrown, saw the ball received by the enemy and moved
up, saw the opposing back spilled nastily. His heart beat faster.

No score at the end of the first half. The third quarter witnessed the
crossing of Webster's goal. Struggling grimly, gamely, against a team
that was their superior without Hugo, against a team heartened by the
knowledge that Hugo was not facing it, Webster's players were being
beaten. The goal was not kicked. It made the score six to nothing
against Webster. Hugo saw the captain rip off his headgear and throw it
angrily on the ground. He understood all that was going on in the minds
of his team in a clear, although remote, way. They went out to show
that they could play the game without Hugo Danner. And they were not
showing what they had hoped to show. A few minutes later their opponents
made a second touchdown.

Thirteen to nothing. Mr. Woodman moved beside Hugo. ""They can't do
it--and I don't altogether blame them. They've depended on you too much.
It's too bad. We all have.""

Hugo nodded. ""Shall I go in?""

The coach watched the next play. ""I guess you better.""

When Hugo entered the line, Jerry Painter and Lefty spoke to him in
strained tones. ""You've got to take it over, Hugo--all the way.""

""All right.""

The men lined up. A tense silence had fallen on the Yale line. They knew
what was going to happen. The signals were called, the ball shot back to
Lefty, Hugo began to run, the men in front rushed together, and Lefty
stuffed the ball into Hugo's arms. ""Go on,"" he shouted. The touchdown
was made in one play. Hugo saw a narrow hole and scooted into it. A man
met his outstretched arm on the other side. Another. Hugo dodged twice.
The crescendo roar of the Webster section came to him dimly. He avoided
the safety man and ran to the goal. In the pandemonium afterwards, Jerry
kicked the goal.

A new kick-off. Hugo felt a hand on his shoulder. ""You've gotta break
this up."" Hugo broke it up. He held Yale almost single-handed. They
kicked back. Hugo returned the kick to the middle of the field. He did
not dare to do more.

Then he stood in his leather helmet, bent, alert, waiting to run again.
They called the captain's signal. He made four yards. Then Lefty's. He
made a first down. Then Jerry's. Two yards. Six yards. Five yards.
Another first down. The stands were insane. Hugo was glad they were not
using him--glad until he saw Jerry Painter's face. It was pale with
rage. Blood trickled across it from a small cut. Three tries failed.
Hugo spoke to him. ""I'll take it over, Jerry, if you say so.""

Jerry doubled his fist and would have struck him if Hugo had not stepped
back. ""God damn you, Danner, you come out here in the last few minutes
all fresh and make us look like a lot of fools. I tell you, my team and
I will take that ball across and not you with your bastard tricks.""

""But, good God, man--""

""You heard me.""

""This is your last down.""

There was time for nothing more. Lefty called Jerry's signal, and Jerry
failed. The other team took the ball, rushed it twice, and kicked back
into the Webster territory. Again the tired, dogged players began a
march forward. The ball was not given to Hugo. He did his best, using
his body as a ram to open holes in the line, tripping tacklers with his
body, fighting within the limits of an appearance of human strength to
get his teammates through to victory. And Jerry, still pale and profane,
drove the men like slaves. It was useless. If Hugo had dared more, they
might have succeeded. But they lost the ball again. It was only in the
last few seconds that an exhausted and victorious team relinquished the
ball to Webster.

Jerry ordered his own number again. Hugo, cold and somewhat furious at
the vanity and injustice of the performance, gritted his teeth. ""How
about letting me try, Jerry? I can make it. It's for Webster--not for
you.""

""You go to hell.""

Lefty said: ""You're out of your head, Jerry.""

""I said I'd take it.""

For one instant Hugo looked into his eyes. And in that instant the
captain saw a dark and flickering fury that filled him with fear. The
whistle blew. And then Hugo, to his astonishment, heard his signal.
Lefty was disobeying the captain. He felt the ball in his arms. He ran
smoothly. Suddenly he saw a dark shadow in the air. The captain hit him
on the jaw with all his strength. After that, Hugo did not think
lucidly. He was momentarily berserk. He ran into the line raging and
upset it like a row of tenpins. He raced into the open. A single man,
thirty yards away, stood between him and the goal. The man drew near in
an instant. Hugo doubled his arm to slug him. He felt the arm
straighten, relented too late, and heard, above the chaos that was
loose, a sudden, dreadful snap. The man's head flew back and he
dropped. Hugo ran across the goal. The gun stopped the game. But, before
the avalanche fell upon him, Hugo saw his victim lying motionless on the
field. What followed was nightmare. The singing and the cheering. The
parade. The smashing of the goal posts. The gradual descent of silence.
A pause. A shudder. He realized that he had been let down from the
shoulders of the students. He saw Woodman, waving his hands, his face a
graven mask. The men met in the midst of that turbulence.

""You killed him, Hugo.""

The earth spun and rocked slowly. He was paying his first price for
losing his temper. ""Killed him?""

""His neck was broken-in three places.""

Some of the others heard. They walked away. Presently Hugo was standing
alone on the cinders outside the stadium. Lefty came up. ""I just heard
about it. Tough luck. But don't let it break you.""

Hugo did not answer. He knew that he was guilty of a sort of murder. In
his own eyes it was murder. He had given away for one red moment to the
leaping, lusting urge to smash the world. And killed a man. They would
never accuse him. They would never talk about it. Only Woodman, perhaps,
would guess the thing behind the murder--the demon inside Hugo that was
tame, except then, when his captain in jealous and inferior rage had
struck him.

It was night. Out of deference to the body of the boy lying in the
Webster chapel there was no celebration. Every ounce of glory and joy
had been drained from the victory. The students left Hugo to a solitude
that was more awful than a thousand scornful tongues. They thought he
would feel as they would feel about such an accident. They gave him
respect when he needed counsel. As he sat by himself, he thought that he
should tell them the truth, all of them, confess a crime and accept the
punishment. Hours passed. At midnight Woodman called.

""There isn't much to say, Hugo. I'm sorry, you're sorry, we're all
sorry. But it occurred to me that you might do something foolish--tell
these people all about it, for example.""

""I was going to.""

""Don't. They'd never understand. You'd be involved in a legal war that
would undoubtedly end in your acquittal. But it would drag in all your
friends--and your mother and father--particularly him. The papers would
go wild. You might, on the other hand, be executed as a menace. You
can't tell.""

""It might be a good thing,"" Hugo answered bitterly.

""Don't let me hear you say that, you fool! I tell you, Hugo, if you go
into that business, I'll get up on the stand and say I knew it all the
time and I let a man play on my team when I was pretty sure that sooner
or later he'd kill someone. Then I'll go to jail surely.""

""You're a pretty fine man, Mr. Woodman.""

""Hell!""

""What shall I do?"" Hugo's voice trembled. He suffered as he had not
dreamed it was possible to suffer.

""That's up to you. I'd say, live it down.""

""Live it down! Do you know what that means--in a college?""

""Yes, I think I do, Hugo.""

""You can live down almost anything, except that one thing--murder. It's
too ugly, Woodie.""

""Maybe. Maybe. You've got to decide, son. If you decide against
trying--and, mind you, you might be justified--I've got a brother-in-law
who has a ranch in Alberta. A couple of hundred miles from any place.
You'd be welcome there.""

Hugo did not reply. He took the coach's hand and wrung it. Then for an
hour the two men sat side by side in the darkness. At last Woodman rose
and left. He said only: ""Remember that offer. It's cold and bleak and
the work is hard. Good-night, Hugo.""

""Good-night, Woodie. Thanks for coming up.""

When the campus was still with the quiet of sleep, Hugo crossed it as
swiftly as a spectre. All night he strode remorselessly over country
roads. His face was set. His eyes burned. He ignored the trembling of
his joints. When the sky faded, he went back. He packed his clothes in
two suit-cases. With them swinging at his side, he stole out of the Psi
Delta house, crossed the campus, stopped. For a long instant he stared
at Webster Hall. The first light of morning was just touching it. The
débris collected for a fire that was never lighted was strewn around the
cannon. He saw the initials he had painted there a year and more ago
still faintly legible. A lump rose in his throat.

""Good-by, Webster,"" he said. He lifted the suitcase and vanished. In a
few minutes the campus was five miles behind him--six--ten--twenty. When
he saw the first early caravan of produce headed toward the market, he
slowed to a walk. The sun came over a hill and sparkled on a billion
drops of dew. A bird flew singing from his path. Hugo Danner had fled
beyond the gates of Webster.




X


A year passed. In the harbour of Cristobal, at the northern end of the
locks, waiting for the day to open the great steel jaws that dammed the
Pacific from the Atlantic, the _Katrina_ pulled at her anchor chain in
the gentle swell. A few stars, liquid bright, hung in the tropical sky.
A little puff of wind coming occasionally from the south carried the
smell of the jungle to the ship. The crew was awakening.

A man with a bucket on a rope went to the rail and hauled up a brimming
pail from the warm sea. He splashed his face and hands into it. Then he
poured it back and repeated the act of dipping up water.

""Hey!"" he said.

Another man joined him. ""Here. Swab off your sweat. Look yonder.""

The dorsal fin of a shark rippled momentarily on the surface and dipped
beneath it. A third man appeared. He accepted the proffered water and
washed himself. His roving eye saw the shark as it rose for the second
time. He dried on a towel. The off-shore breeze stirred his dark hair.
There was a growth of equally dark beard on his tanned jaw and cheek.
Steely muscles bulged under his shirt. His forearm, when he picked up
the pail, was corded like cable. A smell of coffee issued from the
galley, and the smoke of the cook's fire was wafted on deck for a
pungent moment. Two bells sounded. The music went out over the water in
clear, humming waves.

The man who had come first from the forecastle leaned his buttocks
against the rail. One end of it had been unhooked to permit the
discharge of mail. The rail ran, the man fell back, clawing, and then,
thinking suddenly of the sharks, he screamed. The third man looked. He
saw his fellow-seaman go overboard. He jumped from where he stood,
clearing the scuppers and falling through the air before the victim of
the slack rail had landed in the water. The two splashes were almost
simultaneous. A boatswain, hearing the cry, hastened to the scene. He
saw one man lifted clear of the water by the other, who was treading
water furiously. He shouted for a rope. He saw the curve and dip of a
fin. The first man seized the rope and climbed and was pulled up. The
second, his rescuer, dived under water as if aware of something there
that required his attention. The men above him could not know that he
had felt the rake of teeth across his leg--powerful teeth, which
nevertheless did not penetrate his skin. As he dived into the green
depths, he saw a body lunge toward him, turn, yawn a white-fringed
mouth. He snatched the lower jaw in one hand, and the upper in the
other. He exerted his strength. The mouth gaped wider, a tail twelve
feet behind it lashed, the thing died with fingers like steel claws
tearing at its brain. It floated belly up. The man rose, took the rope,
climbed aboard. Other sharks assaulted the dead one.

The dripping sailor clasped his saviour's hand. ""God Almighty, man, you
saved my life. Jesus!""

""That's four,"" Hugo Danner said abstractedly, and then he smiled. ""It's
all right. Forget it. I've had a lot of experience with sharks."" He had
never seen one before in his life. He walked aft, where the men grouped
around him.

""How'd you do it?""

""It's a trick I can't explain very well,"" Hugo said. ""You use their rush
to break their jaws. It takes a good deal of muscle.""

""Anyway--guy--thanks.""

""Sure.""

A whistle blew. The ships were lining up in the order of their arrival
for admission to the Panama Canal. Gatun loomed in the feeble sun of
dawn. The anchor chain rumbled. The _Katrina_ edged forward at half
speed.

The sea. Blue, green, restless, ghost-ridden, driven in empty quarters
by devils riding the wind, secretive, mysterious, making a last
gigantic, primeval stand against the conquest of man, hemming and
isolating the world, beautiful, horrible, dead god of ten thousand
voices, universal incubator, universal grave.

The _Katrina_ came to the islands in the South Pacific. Islands that
issued from the water like green wreaths and seemed to float on it. The
small boats were put out and sections of the cargo were sent to rickety
wharves where white men and brown islanders took charge of it and
carried it away into the fringe of the lush vegetation. Hugo, looking at
those islands, was moved to smile. The place where broken men hid from
civilization, where the derelicts of the world gathered to drown their
shame in a verdant paradise that had no particular position in the white
man's scheme of the earth.

At one of the smaller islands an accident to the engine forced the
_Katrina_ to linger for two weeks. It was during those two weeks, in a
rather extraordinary manner, that Hugo Danner laid the first foundation
of the fortune that he accumulated in his later life. One day, idling
away a leave on shore in the shade of a mighty tree, he saw the
outriggers of the natives file away for the oyster beds, and, out of
pure curiosity, he followed them. For a whole day he watched the men
plunge under the surface in search of pearls. The next day he came back
and dove with one of them.

On the bizarre floor of the ocean, among the colossal fronds of its
flora, the two men swam. They were invaders from the brilliance above
the surface, shooting like fish, horizontally, through the murk and
shadow, and the denizens of that world resented their coming. Great fish
shot past them with malevolent eyes, and the vises of giant clams shut
swiftly in attempts to trap their moving limbs. Hugo was entranced. He
watched the other man as he found the oyster bed and commenced to fill
his basket with frantic haste. When his lungs stung and he could bear
the agony no longer, he turned and forged toward the upper air. Then
they went down again.

Hugo's blood, designed to take more oxygen from the air, and his greater
density fitted him naturally for the work. The pressure did not make him
suffer and the few moments granted to the divers beneath the forbidding
element stretched to a longer time for him.

On the second day of diving he went alone. His amateur attempt had been
surprisingly fruitful. Standing erect in the immense solitude, he
searched the hills and valleys. At length, finding a promising cluster
of shellfish, he began to examine them one by one, pulling them loose,
feeling in their pulpy interior for the precious jewels. He occupied
himself determinedly while the _Katrina_ was waiting in Apia, and at the
end of the stay he had collected more than sixty pearls of great value
and two hundred of moderate worth.

It was, he thought, typical of himself. He had decided to make a fortune
of some sort after the first bitter rage over his debacle at Webster had
abated in his heart. He realized that without wealth his position in
the world would be more difficult and more futile than his fates had
decreed. Poverty, at least, he was not forced to bear. He could wrest
fortune from nature by his might. That he had begun that task by diving
for pearls fitted into his scheme. It was such a method as no other man
would have considered and its achievement robbed no one while it
enriched him.

When the _Katrina_ turned her prow westward again, Hugo worked with his
shipmates in a mood that had undergone considerable change. There was no
more despair in him, little of the taciturnity that had marked his
earliest days at sea, none of the hatred of mankind. He had buried that
slowly and carefully in a dull year of work ashore and a month of toil
on the heaving deck of the ship. For six months he had kept himself
alive in a manner that he could scarcely remember. Driving a truck.
Working on a farm. Digging in a road. His mind a bitter blank, his
valiant dreams all dead.

One day he had saved a man's life. The reaction to that was small, but
it was definite. The strength that could slay was also a strength that
could succour. He had repeated the act some time later. He felt it was a
kind of atonement. After that, he sought deliberately to go where he
might be of assistance. In the city, again, in September, when a fire
engine clanged and whooped through the streets, he followed and carried
a woman from a blazing roof as if by a miracle. Then the seaman. He had
counted four rescues by that time. Perhaps his self-condemnation for the
boy who had fallen on the field at Webster could be stifled eventually.
Human life seemed very precious to Hugo then.

He sold his pearls when the ship touched at large cities--a handful here
and a dozen there, bargaining carefully and forwarding the profit to a
bank in New York. He might have continued that voyage, which was a
voyage commenced half in new recognition of his old wish to see and know
the world and half in the quest of forgetfulness; but a slip and shifts
in the history of the world put an abrupt end to it. When the _Katrina_
rounded the Bec d'Aiglon and steamed into the blue and cocoa harbour of
Marseilles, Hugo heard that war had been declared by Germany, Austria,
France, Russia, England....




XI


In a day the last veil of mist that had shrouded his feelings and
thoughts, making them numb and sterile, vanished; in a day Hugo found
himself--or believed that he had; in a day his life changed and flung
itself on the course which, in a measure, destined its fixation. He
never forgot that day.

It began in the early morning when the anchor of the freighter thundered
into the harbour water. The crew was not given shore leave until noon.
Then the mysterious silence of the captain and the change in the ship's
course was explained. Through the third officer he sent a message to the
seamen. War had been declared. The seaways were unsafe. The _Katrina_
would remain indefinitely at Marseilles. The men could go ashore. They
would report on the following day.

The first announcement of the word sent Hugo's blood racing. War! What
war? With whom? Why? Was America in it, or interested in it? He stepped
ashore and hurried into the city. The populace was in feverish
excitement. Soldiers were everywhere, as if they had sprung up magically
like the seed of the dragon. Hugo walked through street after street in
the furious heat. He bought a paper and read the French accounts of
mobilizations, of a battle impending. He looked everywhere for some one
who could tell him. Twice he approached the American Consulate, but it
was jammed with frantic and frightened people who were trying only to
get away. Hugo's ambition, growing in him like a fire, was in the
opposite direction. War! And he was Hugo Danner!

He sat at a café toward the middle of the afternoon. He was so excited
by the contagion in his veins that he scarcely thrilled at the first use
of his new and half-mastered tongue. The _garçon_ hurried to his table.

""_De la bière_,"" Hugo said.

The waiter asked a question which Hugo could not understand, so he
repeated his order in the universal language of measurement of a large
glass by his hands. The waiter nodded. Hugo took his beer and stared out
at the people. They hurried along the sidewalk, brushing the table at
which he sat. They called to each other, laughed, cried sometimes, and
shook hands over and over. ""_La guerre_"" was on every tongue. Old men
gestured the directions of battles. Young men, a little more serious
perhaps, and often very drunk, were rushing into uniform as order
followed order for mobilization. And there were girls, thousands of
them, walking with the young men.

Hugo wanted to be in it. He was startled by the impact of that desire.
All the ferocity of him, all the unleashed wish to rend and kill, was
blazing in his soul. But it was a subtle conflagration, which urged him
in terms of duty, in words that spoke of the war as his one perfect
opportunity to put himself to a use worthy of his gift. A war. In a war
what would hold him, what would be superior to him, who could resist
him? He swallowed glass after glass of the brackish beer, quenching a
mighty thirst and firing a mightier ambition. He saw himself charging
into battle, fighting till his ammunition was gone, till his bayonet
broke; and then turning like a Titan and doing monster deeds with bare
hands. And teeth.

Bands played and feet marched. His blood rose to a boiling-point. A
Frenchman flung himself at Hugo's table. ""And you--why aren't you a
soldier?""

""I will be,"" Hugo replied.

""Bravo! We shall revenge ourselves."" The man gulped a glass of wine,
slapped Hugo's shoulder, and was gone. Then a girl talked to Hugo. Then
another man.

Hugo dwelt on the politics of the war and its sociology only in the most
perfunctory manner. It was time the imperialistic ambitions of the
Central Powers were ended. A war was inevitable for that purpose.
France and England had been attacked. They were defending themselves. He
would assist them. Even the problem of citizenship and the tangle of red
tape his enlistment might involve did not impress him. He could see the
field of battle and hear the roar of guns, a picture conjured up by his
knowledge of the old wars. What a soldier he would be!

While his mind was still leaping and throbbing and his head was
whirling, darkness descended. He would give away his life, do his duty
and a hundred times more than his duty. Here was the thing that was
intended for him, the weapon forged for his hand, the task designed for
his undertaking. War. In war he could bring to a full fruition the
majesty of his strength. No need to fear it there, no need to be ashamed
of it. He felt himself almost the Messiah of war, the man created at the
precise instant he was required. His call to serve was sounding in his
ears. And the bands played.

The chaos did not diminish at night, but, rather, it increased. He went
with milling crowds to a bulletin board. The Germans had commenced to
move. They had entered Belgium in violation of treaties long held
sacred. Belgium was resisting and Liége was shaking at the devastation
of the great howitzers. A terrible crime. Hugo shook with the rage of
the crowd. The first outrages and violations, highly magnified, were
reported. The blond beast would have to be broken.

""God damn,"" a voice drawled at Hugo's side. He turned. A tall, lean man
stood there, a man who was unquestionably American. Hugo spoke in
instant excitement.

""There sure is hell to pay.""

The man turned his head and saw Hugo. He stared at him rather
superciliously, at his slightly seedy clothes and his strong, unusual
face. ""American?""

""Yeah.""

""Let's have a drink.""

They separated themselves from the mob and went to a crowded café. The
man sat down and Hugo took a chair at his side. ""As you put it,"" the man
said, ""there is hell to pay. Let's drink on the payment.""

Hugo felt in him a certain aloofness, a detachment that checked his
desire to throw himself into flamboyant conversation. ""My name's
Danner,"" he said.

""Mine's Shayne, Thomas Mathew Shayne. I'm from New York.""

""So am I, in a way. I was on a ship that was stranded here by the war.
At loose ends now.""

Shayne nodded. He was not particularly friendly for a person who had met
a countryman in a strange city. Hugo did not realize that Shayne had
been besieged all day by distant acquaintances and total strangers for
assistance in leaving France, or that he expected a request for money
from Hugo momentarily. And Shayne did not seem particularly wrought up
by the condition of war. They lifted their glasses and drank. Hugo lost
a little of his ardour.

""Nice mess.""

""Time, though. Time the Germans got their answer.""

Shayne's haughty eyebrows lifted. His wide, thin mouth smiled. ""Perhaps.
I just came from Germany. Seemed like a nice, peaceful country three
weeks ago.""

""Oh."" Hugo wondered if there were many pro-German Americans. His
companion answered the thought.

""Not that I don't believe the Germans are wrong. But war is such--such a
damn fool thing.""

""Well, it can't be helped.""

""No, it can't. We're all going to go out and get killed, though.""

""We?""

""Sure. America will get in it. That's part of the game. America is more
dangerous to Germany than France--or England, for that matter.""

""That's a rather cold-blooded viewpoint.""

Shayne nodded. ""I've been raised on it. _Garçon, l'addition, s'il vous
plaît._"" He reached for his pocketbook simultaneously with Hugo. ""I'm
sorry you're stranded,"" he said, ""and if a hundred francs will help,
I'll be glad to let you have it. I can't do more.""

Hugo's jaw dropped. He laughed a little. ""Good lord, man, I said my ship
was stuck. Not me. And these drinks are mine."" He reached into his
pocket and withdrew a huge roll of American bills and a packet of
French notes.

Shayne hesitated. His calmness was not severely shaken, however. ""I'm
sorry, old man. You see, all day I've been fighting off starving and
startled Americans and I thought you were one. I apologize for my
mistake."" He looked at Hugo with more interest. ""As a matter of fact,
I'm a little skittish about patriotism. And about war. Of course, I'm
going to be in it. The first entertaining thing that has happened in a
dog's age. But I'm a conscientious objector on principles. I rather
thought I'd enlist in the Foreign Legion to-morrow.""

He was an unfamiliar type to Hugo. He represented the American who had
been educated at home and abroad, who had acquired a wide horizon for
his views, who was bored with the routine of his existence. His clothes
were elegant and impeccable. His face was very nearly inscrutable.
Although he was only a few years older than Hugo, he made the latter
feel youthful.

They had a brace of drinks, two more and two more. All about them was
bedlam, as if the emotions of man had suddenly been let loose to sweep
him off his feet. Grief, joy, rage, lust, fear were all obviously there
in almost equal proportions.

Shayne extended his hand. ""They have something to fight for, at least.
Something besides money and glory. A grudge. I wonder what it is that
makes me want to get in? I do.""

""So do I.""

Shayne shook his head. ""I wouldn't if I were you. Still, you will
probably be compelled to in a while."" He looked at his watch. ""Do you
care to take dinner with me? I had an engagement with an aunt who is on
the verge of apoplexy because two of the Boston Shaynes are in Munich.
It scarcely seems appropriate at the moment. I detest her, anyway. What
do you say?""

""I'd like to have dinner with you.""

They walked down the Cannebière. At a restaurant on the east side near
the foot of the thoroughfare they found a table in the corner. A pair of
waiters hastened to take their order. The place was riotous with voices
and the musical sounds of dining. On a special table was a great
demijohn of 1870 cognac, which was fast being drained by the guests.
Shayne consulted with his companion and then ordered in fluent French.
The meal that was brought approached a perfection of service and a
superiority of cooking that Hugo had never experienced. And always the
babble, the blare of bands, the swelling and fading persistence of the
stringed orchestra, the stream of purple Châteauneuf du Pape and its
flinty taste, the glitter of the lights and the bright colours on the
mosaics that represented the principal cities of Europe. It was a
splendid meal.

""I'm afraid I'll have to ask your name again,"" Shayne said.

""Danner. Hugo Danner.""

""Good God! Not the football player?""

""I did play football--some time ago.""

""I saw you against Cornell--when was it?--two years ago. You were
magnificent. How does it happen that--""

""That I'm here?"" Hugo looked directly into Shayne's eyes.

""Well--I have no intention of prying into your affairs.""

""Then I'll tell you. Why not?"" Hugo drank his wine. ""I killed a man--in
the game--and quit. Beat it.""

Shayne accepted the statement calmly. ""That's tough. I can understand
your desire to get out from under. Things like that are bad when you're
young.""

""What else could I have done?""

""Nothing. What are you going to do? Rather, what were you going to do?""

""I don't know,"" Hugo answered slowly. ""What do you do? What do people
generally do?"" He felt the question was drunken, but Shayne accepted it
at its face value.

""I'm one of those people who have too much money to be able to do
anything I really care about, most of the time. The family keeps me in
sight and control. But I'm going to cut away to-morrow.""

""In the Foreign Legion? I'll go with you.""

""Splendid!"" They shook hands across the table.

Three hours later found them at another café. They had been walking part
of the time in the throngs on the street. For a while they had stood
outside a newspaper office watching the bulletins. They were quite
drunk.

""Old man,"" Shayne said, ""I'm mighty glad I found you.""

""Me, too, old egg. Where do we go next?""

""I don't know. What's your favourite vice? We can locate it in
Marseilles.""

Hugo frowned. ""Well, vice is so limited in its scope.""

His companion chuckled. ""Isn't it? I've always said vice was narrow. The
next time I see Aunt Emma I'm going to say: 'Emma, vice is becoming too
narrow in its scope.' She'll be furious and it will bring her to an
early demise and I'll inherit a lot more money, and that will be the
real tragedy. She's a useless old fool, Aunt Emma. Never did a valuable
thing in her life. Goes in for charity--just like we go in for golf and
what-not. Oh, well, to hell with Aunt Emma.""

Hugo banged his glass on the table. ""_Garçon! Encore deux whiskey à
l'eau_ and to hell with Aunt Emma.""

""Like to play roulette?""

""Like to try.""

They climbed into a taxi. Shayne gave an address and they were driven to
another quarter of the town. In a room packed with people in evening
clothes they played for an hour. Several people spoke to Shayne and he
introduced Hugo to them. Shayne won and Hugo lost. They went out into
the night. The streets were quieter in that part of town. Two girls
accosted them.

""That gives me an idea,"" Shayne said. ""Let's find a phone. Maybe we can
get Marcelle and Claudine.""

Marcelle and Claudine met them at the door of the old house. Their arms
were laden with champagne bottles. The interior of the dwelling belied
its cold, grey, ancient stones. Hugo did not remember much of what
followed that evening. Short, unrelated fragments stuck in his
mind--Shayne chasing the white form of Marcelle up and down the stairs;
himself in a huge bath-tub washing a back in front of him, his surprise
when he saw daylight through the wooden shutters of the house.

Someone was shaking him. ""Come on, soldier. The leave's up.""

He opened his eyes and collected his thoughts. He grinned at Shayne.
""All right. But if I had to defend myself right now--I'd fail against a
good strong mouse.""

""We'll fix that. Hey! Marcelle! Got any Fernet-Branca?""

The girl came with two large glasses of the pick-me-up. Hugo swallowed
the bitter brown fluid and shuddered. Claudine awoke. ""_Chéri!_"" she
sighed, and kissed him.

They sat on the edge of the bed. ""Boy!"" Hugo said. ""What a binge!""

""You like eet?"" Claudine murmured.

He took her hand. ""Loved it, darling. And now we're going to war.""

""Ah!"" she said, and, at the door: ""_Bonne chance!_""

Shayne left Hugo, after agreeing on a time and place for their meeting
in the afternoon. The hours passed slowly. Hugo took another drink, and
then, exerting his judgment and will, he refrained from taking more. At
noon he partook of a light meal. He thought, or imagined, that the
ecstasy of the day before was showing some signs of decline. It occurred
to him that the people might be very sober and quiet before the war was
a thing to be written into the history of France.

The sun was shining. He found a place in the shade where he could avoid
it. He ordered a glass of beer, tasted it, and forgot to finish it. The
elation of his first hours had passed. But the thing within him that had
caused it was by no means dead. As he sat there, his muscles tensed with
the picturization of what was soon to be. He saw the grim shadows of the
enemy. He felt the hot splash of blood. For one suspended second he was
ashamed of himself, and then he stamped out that shame as being
something very much akin to cowardice.

He wondered why Shayne was joining the Legion and what sort of person he
was underneath his rather haughty exterior. A man of character,
evidently, and one who was weary of the world to which he had been
privileged. Hugo's reverie veered to his mother and father. He tried to
imagine what they would think of his enlistment, of him in the war; and
even what they thought of him from the scant and scattered information
he had supplied. He was sure that he would justify himself. He felt
purged and free and noble. His strength was a thing of wreck and ruin,
given to the world at a time when wreck and ruin were needed to set it
right. It was odd that such a product should emerge from the dusty brain
of a college professor in a Bible-ridden town.

Hugo had not possessed a religion for a long time. Now, wondering on
another tangent if the war might not bring about his end, he thought
about it. He realized that he would hate himself for murmuring a prayer
or asking protection. He was gamer than the Cross-obsessed weaklings who
were not wise enough to look life in the face and not brave enough to
draw the true conclusions from what they saw. True conclusions? He
meditated. What did it matter--agnosticism, atheism, pantheism--anything
but the savage and anthropomorphic twaddle that had been doled out since
the Israelites singled out Jehovah from among their many gods. He would
not commit himself. He would go back with his death to the place where
he had been before he was born and feel no more regret than he had in
that oblivious past. Meanwhile he would fight! He moved restively and
waited for Shayne with growing impatience.

Until that chaotic and gorgeous hour he had lived for nothing, proved
nothing, accomplished nothing. Society was no better in any way because
he had lived. He excepted the lives he had saved, the few favours he had
done. That was nothing in proportion to his powers. He was his own
measure, and by his own efforts would he satisfy himself. War! He flexed
his arms. War. His black eyes burned with a formidable light.

Then Shayne came. Walking with long strides. A ghostly smile on his
lips. A darkness in his usually pale-blue eyes. Hugo liked him. They
said a few words and walked toward the recruiting-tent. A _poilu_ in
steely blue looked at them and saw that they were good. He proffered
papers. They signed. That night they marched for the first time. A week
later they were sweating and swearing over the French manual of arms.
Hugo had offered his services to the commanding officer at the camp and
been summarily denied an audience or a chance to exhibit his abilities.
When they reached the lines--that would be time enough. Well, he could
wait until those lines were reached.




XII


Just as the eastern horizon became light with something more steady than
the flare of the guns, the command came. Hugo bit his lip till it bled
darkly. He would show them--now. They might command him to wait--he
could restrain himself no longer. The men had been standing there tense
and calm, their needle-like bayonets pointing straight up. ""_En avant!_""

His heart gave a tremendous surge. It made his hands falter as he
reached for the ladder rung. ""Here we go, Hugo.""

""Luck, Tom.""

He saw Shayne go over. He followed slowly. He looked at no man's land.
They had come up in the night and he had never seen it. The scene of
holocaust resembled nothing more than the municipal ash dump at Indian
Creek. It startled him. The grey earth in irregular heaps, the litter of
metal and equipment. He realized that he was walking forward with the
other men. The ground under his feet was mushy, like ashes. Then he saw
part of a human body. It changed his thoughts.

The man on Hugo's right emitted a noise like a squeak and jumped up in
the air. He had been hit. Out of the corner of his eye Hugo saw him
fall, get up quickly, and fall again very slowly. His foot kicked after
he lay down. The rumbling in the sky grew louder and blotted out all
other sound.

They walked on and on. It was like some eternal journey through the dun,
vacant realms of Hades. Not much light, one single sound, and ghostly
companions who faced always forward. The air in front of him was
suddenly dyed orange and he felt the concussion of a shell. His ears
rang. He was still walking. He walked what he thought was a number of
miles.

His great strength seemed to have left him, and in its place was a
complete enervation. With a deliberate effort he tested himself, kicking
his foot into the earth. It sank out of sight. He squared his shoulders.
A man came near him, yelling something. It was Shayne. Hugo shook his
head. Then he heard the voice, a feeble shrill note. ""Soon be there.""

""Yeah?""

""Over that hill.""

Shayne turned away and became part of the ghost escort of Hugo and his
peculiarly lucid thoughts. He believed that he was more conscious of
himself and things then than ever before in his life. But he did not
notice one-tenth of the expression and action about himself. The top of
the rise was near. He saw an officer silhouetted against it for an
instant. The officer moved down the other side. He could see over the
rise, then.

Across the grey ashes was a long hole. In front of it a maze of wire. In
it--mushrooms. German helmets. Hugo gaped at them. All that training,
all that restraint, had been expended for this. They were small and
without meaning. He felt a sharp sting above his collar bone. He looked
there. A row of little holes had appeared in his shirt.

""Good God,"" he whispered, ""a machine gun.""

But there was no blood. He sat down. He presumed, as a casualty, he was
justified in sitting down. He opened his shirt by ripping it down. On
his dark-tanned skin there were four red marks. The bullets had not
penetrated him. Too tough! He stared numbly at the walking men. They had
passed him. The magnitude of his realization held him fixed for a full
minute. He was invulnerable! He should have known it--otherwise he would
have torn himself apart by his own strength. Suddenly he roared and
leaped to his feet. He snatched his rifle, cracking the stock in his
fervour. He vaulted toward the helmets in the trench.

He dropped from the parapet and was confronted by a long knife on a gun.
His lips parted, his eyes shut to slits, he drew back his own weapon.
There was an instant's pause as they faced each other--two men, both
knowing that in a few seconds one would be dead. Then Hugo, out of his
scarlet fury, had one glimpse of his antagonist's face and person. The
glimpse was but a flash. It was finished in quick motions. He was a
little man--a foot shorter than Hugo. His eyes looked out from under his
helmet with a sort of pathetic earnestness. And he was worried, horribly
worried, standing there with his rifle lifted and trying to remember the
precise technique of what would follow even while he fought back the
realization that it was hopeless. In that split second Hugo felt a
human, amazing urge to tell him that it was all right, and that he ought
to hold his bayonet a little higher and come forward a bit faster. The
image faded back to an enemy. Hugo acted mechanically from the rituals
of drill. His own knife flashed. He saw the man's clothes part smoothly
from his bowels, where the point had been inserted, up to the gray-green
collar. The seam reddened, gushed blood, and a length of intestine
slipped out of it. The man's eyes looked at Hugo. He shook his head
twice. The look became far-away. He fell forward.

Hugo stepped over him. He was trembling and nauseated. A more formidable
man approached warily. The bellow of battle returned to Hugo's ears. He
pushed back the threatening rifle easily and caught the neck in one
hand, crushing it to a wet, sticky handful. So he walked through the
trench, a machine that killed quickly and remorselessly--a black warrior
from a distant realm of the universe where the gods had bred another
kind of man.

He came upon Shayne and found him engaged. Hugo stuck his opponent in
the back. No thought of fair play, no object but to kill--it did not
matter how. Dead Legionnaires and dead Germans mingled blood underfoot.
The trench was like the floor of an _abattoir_. Someone gave him a
drink. The men who remained went on across the ash dump to a second
trench.

It was night. The men, almost too tired to see or move, were trying to
barricade themselves against the ceaseless shell fire of the enemy. They
filled bags with gory mud and lifted them on the crumbling walls. At
dawn the Germans would return to do what they had done. The darkness
reverberated and quivered. Hugo worked like a Trojan. His efforts had
made a wide and deep hole in which machine guns were being placed.
Shayne fell at his feet. Hugo lifted him up. The captain nodded. ""Give
him a drink.""

Someone brought liquor, and Hugo poured it between Shayne's teeth.
""Huh!"" Shayne said.

""Come on, boy.""

""How did you like it, Danner?""

Hugo did not answer. Shayne went on, ""I didn't either--much. This is no
gentleman's war. Jesus! I saw a thing or two this morning. A guy walking
with all his--""

""Never mind. Take another drink.""

""Got anything to eat?""

""No.""

""Oh, well, we can fight on empty bellies. The Germans will empty them
for us anyhow.""

""The hell they will.""

""I'm pretty nearly all in.""

""So's everyone.""

They put Hugo on watch because he still seemed fresh. Those men who were
not compelled to stay awake fell into the dirt and slept immediately.
Toward dawn Hugo heard sounds in no man's land. He leaped over the
parapet. In three jumps he found himself among the enemy. They were
creeping forward. Hugo leaped back. ""_Ils viennent!_""

Men who slept like death were kicked conscious. They rose and fired into
the night. The surprise of the attack was destroyed. The enemy came on,
engaging in the darkness with the exhausted Legionnaires. Twice Hugo
went among them when inundation threatened and, using his rifle barrel
as a club, laid waste on every hand. He walked through them striking and
shattering. And twice he saved his salient from extermination. Day came
sullenly. It began to rain. The men stood silently among their dead.

Hugo lit a cigarette. His eyes moved up and down the shambles. At
intervals of two yards a man, his helmet trickling rain, his clothes
filthy, his face inscrutable. Shayne was there on sagging knees. Hugo
could not understand why he had not been killed.

Hugo was learning about war. He thought then that the task which he had
set for himself was not altogether to his liking. There should be other
and more important things for him to do. He did not like to slaughter
individuals. The day passed like a cycle in hell. No change in the
personnel except that made by an occasional death. No food. No water.
They seemed to be exiled by their countrymen in a pool of fire and
famine and destruction. At dusk Hugo spoke to the captain.

""We cannot last another night without water, food,"" he said.

""We shall die here, then.""

""I should like, sir, to volunteer to go back and bring food.""

""We need ammunition more.""

""Ammunition, then.""

""One man could not bring enough to assist--much.""

""I can.""

""You are valuable here. With your club and your charmed life, you have
already saved this remnant of good soldiers.""

""I will return in less than an hour.""

""Good luck, then.""

Where there had been a man, there was nothing. The captain blinked his
eyes and stared at the place. He swore softly in French and plunged into
his dug-out at the sound of ripping in the sky.

A half hour passed. The steady, nerve-racking bombardment continued at
an unvaried pace. Then there was a heavy thud like that of a shell
landing and not exploding. The captain looked. A great bundle, tied
together by ropes, had descended into the trench. A man emerged from
beneath it. The captain passed his hand over his eyes. Here was
ammunition for the rifles and the machine guns in plenty. Here was food.
Here were four huge tins of water, one of them leaking where a shell
fragment had pierced it. Here was a crate of canned meat and a sack of
onions and a stack of bread loaves. Hugo broke the ropes. His chest rose
and fell rapidly. He was sweating. The bundle he had carried weighed
more than a ton--and he had been running very swiftly.

The captain looked again. A case of cognac. Hugo was carrying things
into the dug-out. ""Where?"" the captain asked.

Hugo smiled and named a town thirty kilometres behind the lines. A town
where citizens and soldiers together were even then in frenzied
discussion over the giant who had fallen upon their stores and supplies
and taken them, running off like a locomotive, in a hail of bullets that
did no harm to him.

""And how?"" the captain asked.

""I am strong.""

The captain shrugged and turned his head away. His men were eating the
food, and drinking water mixed with brandy, and stuffing their pouches
with ammunition. The machine gunners were laughing. They would not be
forced to spare the precious belts when the Germans came in the
morning. Hugo sat among them, dining his tremendous appetite.

Three days went by. Every day, twice, five times, they were attacked.
But no offence seemed capable of driving that demoniac cluster of men
from their position. A demon, so the enemy whispered, came out and
fought for them. On the third day the enemy retreated along four
kilometres of front, and the French moved up to reclaim many, many acres
of their beloved soil. The Legionnaires were relieved and another
episode was added to their valiant history.

Hugo slept for twenty hours in the wooden barracks. After that he was
wakened by the captain's orderly and summoned to his quarters. The
captain smiled when he saluted. ""My friend,"" he said, ""I wish to thank
you in behalf of my country for your labour. I have recommended you for
the Croix de Guerre.""

Hugo took his outstretched hand. ""I am pleased that I have helped.""

""And now,"" the captain continued, ""you will tell me how you executed
that so unusual coup.""

Hugo hesitated. It was the opportunity he had sought, the chance that
might lead to a special commission whereby he could wreak the vengeance
of his muscles on the enemy. But he was careful, because he did not feel
secure in trusting the captain with too much of his secret. Even in a
war it was too terrible. They would mistrust him, or they would attempt
to send him to their biologists. And he wanted to accomplish his mission
under their permission and with their co-operation. It would be more
valuable then and of greater magnitude. So he smiled and said: ""Have you
ever heard of Colorado?""

""No, I have not heard. It is a place?""

""A place in America. A place that has scarcely been explored. I was born
there. And all the men of Colorado are born as I was born and are like
me. We are very strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded
except by the largest shells. I took that package by force and I carried
it to you on my back, running swiftly.""

The captain appeared politely interested. He thumbed a dispatch. He
stared at Hugo. ""If that is the truth, you shall show me.""

""It is the truth--and I shall show you.""

Hugo looked around. Finally he walked over to the sentry at the flap of
the tent and took his rifle. The man squealed in protest. Hugo lifted
him off the floor by the collar, shook him, and set him down.

The man shouted in dismay and then was silent at a word from the
captain. Hugo weighed the gun in his hands while they watched and then
slowly bent the barrel double. Next he tore it from its stock. Then he
grasped the parallel steel ends and broke them apart with a swift
wrench. The captain half rose, his eyes bulged, he knocked over his
ink-well. His hand tugged at his moustache and waved spasmodically.

""You see?"" Hugo said.

The captain went to staff meeting that afternoon very thoughtful. He
understood the difficulty of exhibiting his soldier's prowess under
circumstances that would assure the proper commission. He even
considered remaining silent about Hugo. With such a man in his company
it would soon be illustrious along the whole broad front. But the chance
came. When the meeting was finished and the officers relaxed over their
wine, a colonel brought up the subject of the merits of various breeds
of men as soldiers.

""I think,"" he said, ""that the Prussians are undoubtedly our most
dangerous foe. On our own side we have--""

""Begging the colonel's pardon,"" the captain said, ""there is a species of
fighter unknown, or almost unknown, in this part of the world, who
excels by far all others.""

""And who may they be?"" the colonel asked stiffly.

""Have you ever heard of the Colorados?""

""No,"" the colonel said.

Another officer meditated. ""They are redskins, American Indians, are
they not?""

The captain shrugged. ""I do not know. I know only that they are superior
to all other soldiers.""

""And in what way?""

The captain's eyes flickered. ""I have one Colorado in my troops. I will
tell you what he did in five days near the town of Barsine."" The
officers listened. When the captain finished, the colonel patted his
shoulder. ""That is a very amusing fabrication. Very. With a thousand
such men, the war would be ended in a week. Captain Crouan, I fear you
have been overgenerous in pouring the wine.""

The captain rose, saluted. ""With your permission, I shall cause my
Colorado to be brought and you shall see.""

The other men laughed. ""Bring him, by all means.""

The captain dispatched an orderly. A few minutes later, Hugo was
announced at headquarters. The captain introduced him. ""Here, messieurs,
is a Colorado. What will you have him do?""

The colonel, who had expected the soldier to be both embarrassed and
made ridiculous, was impressed by Hugo's calm demeanour. ""You are
strong?"" he said with a faint irony.

""Exceedingly.""

""He is not humble, at least, gentlemen."" Laughter. The colonel fixed
Hugo with his eye. ""Then, my good fellow, if you are so strong, if you
can run so swiftly and carry such burdens, bring us one of our beautiful
seventy-fives from the artillery.""

""With your written order, if you please.""

The colonel started, wrote the order laughingly, and gave it to Hugo. He
left the room.

""It is a good joke,"" the colonel said. ""But I fear it is harsh on the
private.""

The captain shrugged. Wine was poured. In a few minutes they heard heavy
footsteps outside the tent. ""He is here!"" the captain cried. The
officers rushed forward. Hugo stood outside the tent with the cannon
they had requested lifted over his head in one hand. With that same hand
clasped on the breach, he set it down. The colonel paled and gulped.
""Name of the mother of God! He has brought it.""

Hugo nodded. ""It was as nothing, my colonel. Now I will show you what we
men from Colorado can do. Watch.""

They eyed him. There was a grating sound beneath his feet. Those who
were quickest of vision saw his body catapult through the air high over
their heads. It landed, bounced prodigiously, vanished.

Captain Crouan coughed and swallowed. He faced his superiors, trying to
seem nonchalant. ""That, gentlemen, is the sort of thing the Colorados
do--for sport.""

The colonel recovered first. ""It is not human. Gentlemen, we have been
in the presence of the devil himself.""

""Or the Good Lord.""

The captain shook his head. ""He is a man, I tell you. In Colorado all
the men are like that. He told me so himself. When he first enlisted, he
came to me and asked for a special commission to go to Berlin and smash
the Reich--to bring back the Kaiser himself. I thought he was mad. I
made him peel potatoes. He did not say any more foolish things. He was a
good soldier. Then the battle came and I saw him, not believing I saw
him, standing on the parapet and wielding his rifle like the lightning,
killing I do not know how many men. Hundreds certainly, perhaps
thousands. Ah, it is as I said, the Colorados are the finest soldiers on
earth. They are more than men.""

""He comes!""

Hugo burst from the sky, moving like a hawk. He came from the direction
of the lines, many miles away. There was a bundle slung across his
shoulder. There were holes in his uniform. He landed heavily among the
officers and set down his burden. It was a German. He dropped to the
ground.

""Water for him,"" Hugo panted. ""He has fainted. I snatched him from his
outpost in a trench.""




XIII


At Blaisencourt it was spring again. The war was nearly a year old.
Blaisencourt was now a street of houses' ghosts, of rubble and dirt,
populated by soldiers. A little new grass sprouted peevishly here and
there; an occasional house retained enough of its original shape to
harbour an industry. Captain Crouan, his arm in a sling, was looking
over a heap of débris with the aid of field glasses.

""I see him,"" he said, pointing to a place on the boiling field where an
apparent lump of soil had detached itself.

""He rises! He goes on! He takes one of his mighty leaps! Ah, God, if I
only had a company of such men!""

His aide, squatted near by, muttered something under his breath. The
captain spoke again. ""He is very near their infernal little gun now. He
has taken his rope. Ahaaaa! He spins it in the air. It falls. They are
astonished. They rise up in the trench. Quick, Phèdre! Give me a rifle.""
The rifle barked sharply four, five times. Its bullet found a mark.
Then another. ""Ahaaa! Two of them! And M. Danner now has his rope on
that pig's breath. It comes up. See! He has taken it under his arm! They
are shooting their machine guns. He drops into a shell hole. He has been
hit, but he is laughing at them. He leaps. Look out, Phèdre!""

Hugo landed behind the débris with a small German trench mortar in his
arms. He set it on the floor. The captain opened his mouth, and Hugo
waved to him to be silent. Deliberately, Hugo looked over the rickety
parapet of loose stones. He elevated the muzzle of the gun and drew back
the lanyard. The captain, grinning, watched through his glasses. The gun
roared.

Its shell exploded presently on the brow of the enemy trench, tossing up
a column of smoke and earth. ""I should have brought some ammunition with
me,"" Hugo said.

Captain Crouan stared at the little gun. ""Pig,"" he said. ""Son of a pig!
Five of my men are in your little belly! Bah!"" He kicked it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Summer in Aix-au-Dixvaches. A tall Englishman addressing Captain Crouan.
His voice was irritated by the heat. ""Is it true that you French have an
Indian scout here who can bash in those Minenwerfers?""

""_Pardon, mon colonel, mais je ne comprends pas l'anglais._""

He began again in bad French. Captain Crouan smiled. ""Ah? You are
troubled there on your sector? You wish to borrow our astonishing
soldier? It will be a pleasure, I assure you.""

Hot calm night. The sky pin-pricked with stars, the air redolent with
the mushy flavour of dead meat. So strong it left a taste in the mouth.
So strong that food and water tasted like faintly chlorinated
putrescence. Hugo, his blue uniform darker with perspiration, tramped
through the blackness to a dug-out. Fifteen minutes in candlelight with
a man who spoke English in an odd manner.

""They've been raisin' bloody hell with us from a point about there."" The
tap of a pencil. ""We've got little enough confidence in you, God
knows--""

""Thank you.""

""Don't be huffy. We're obliged to your captain for the loan of you. But
we've lost too many trying to take the place ourselves not to be fed up
with it. I suppose you'll want a raiding party?""

""No, thanks.""

""But, cripes, you can't make it there alone.""

""I can do it."" Hugo smiled. ""And you've lost so many of your own men--""

""Very well.""

       *       *       *       *       *

Otto Meyer pushed his helmet back on his sandy-haired head and gasped in
the feverish air. A non-commissioned officer passing behind him shoved
the helmet over his eyes with a muttered word of caution. Otto
shrugged. Half a dozen men lounged near by. Beside and above them were
the muzzles of four squat guns and the irregular silhouette of a heap of
ammunition. Two of the men rolled onto their backs and panted. ""I wish,""
one said in a soft voice, ""that I was back in the Hofbrau at Munich with
a tall stein of beer, with that fat _Fräulein_ that kissed me in the
Potsdam station last September sitting at my side and the orchestra
playing--""

Otto flung a clod of dank earth at the speaker. There were chuckles from
the shadows that sucked in and exhaled the rancid air. Outside the pit
in which they lay, there was a gentle thud.

Otto scrambled into a sitting posture. ""What is that?""

""Nothing. Even these damned English aren't low enough to fight us in
this weather.""

""You can never tell. At night, in the first battle of--listen!""

The thud was repeated, much closer. It was an ominous sound, like the
drop of a sack of earth from a great height. Otto picked up a gun. He
was a man who perspired freely, and now, in that single minute, his face
trickled. He pointed the gun into the air and pulled the trigger. It
kicked back and jarred his arm. In the glaring light that followed, six
men peered through the spider-web of the wire. They saw nothing.

""You see?""

Their eyes smarted with the light and dark, so swiftly exchanged. Came
a thud in their midst. A great thud that spattered the dirt in all
directions. ""Something has fallen."" ""A shell!"" ""It's a dud!""

The men rose and tried to run. Otto had regained his vision and saw the
object that had descended. A package of yellow sticks tied to a great
mass of iron--wired to it. Instead of running, he grasped it. His
strength was not enough to lift it. Then, for one short eternity, he saw
a sizzling spark move toward the sticks. He clutched at it. ""Help! The
guns must be saved. A bomb!"" He knew his arms surrounded death. ""I
cannot--""

His feeble voice was blown to the four winds at that instant. A terrible
explosion burst from him, shattering the escaping men, blasting the
howitzers into fragments, enlarging the pit to enormous dimensions. Both
fronts clattered with machine-gun fire. Flares lit the terrain. Hugo,
running as if with seven-league boots, was thrown on his face by the
concussion.

       *       *       *       *       *

Winter. Mud. A light fall of snow that was split into festers by the
guns before it could anneal the ancient sores. Hugo shivered and stared
into no man's land, whence a groan had issued for twenty hours, audible
occasionally over the tumult of the artillery. He saw German eyes turned
mutely on the same heap of rags that moved pitifully over the snow,
leaving a red wake, dragging a bloody thing behind. It rose and fell,
moving parallel to the two trenches. Many machine-gun bullets had
either missed it or increased its crimson torment. Hugo went out and
killed the heap of rags, with a revolver that cracked until the groans
stopped in a low moan. Breaths on both sides were bated. The rags had
been gray-green. A shout of low, rumbling praise came from the silent
enemy trenches. Hugo looked over there for a moment and smiled. He
looked down at the thing and vomited. The guns began again.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another winter. Time had become stagnant. All about it was a pool of mud
and suppuration, and shot through it was the sound of guns and the scent
of women, the taste of wine and the touch of cold flesh. Somewhere, he
could not remember distinctly where, Hugo had a clean uniform, a
portfolio of papers, a jewel-case of medals. He was a great man--a man
feared. The Colorado in the Foreign Legion. Men would talk about what
they had seen him accomplish all through the next fifty years--at
watering places in the Sahara, at the crackling fires of country-house
parties in Shropshire, on the shores of the South Seas, on the moon,
maybe. Old men, at the last, would clear the phlegm from their skinny
throats and begin: ""When I was a-fightin' with the Legion in my youngest
days, there was a fellow in our company that came from some place in
wild America that I disrecollect."" And younger, more sanguine men would
listen and shake their heads and wish that there was a war for them to
fight.

Hugo was not satisfied with that. Still, he could see no decent exit and
contrive no better use for himself. He clung frantically to the ideals
he had taken with him and to the splendid purpose with which he had
emblazoned his mad lust to enlist. Marseilles and the sentiment it had
inspired seemed very far away. He thought about it as he walked toward
the front, his head bent into the gale and his helmet pitched to protect
his eyes from the sting of the rain.

That night he slept with Shayne, a lieutenant now, twice wounded, thrice
decorated, and, like Hugo, thinner than he had been, older, with eyes
grown bleak, and seldom vehement. He resembled his lean Yankee ancestors
after their exhausting campaigns of the wilderness, alive and sentient
only through a sheer stubbornness that brooked neither element nor
disaster. Only at rare moments did the slight strain of his French blood
lift him from that grim posture. Such a moment was afforded by the
arrival of Hugo.

""Great God, Hugo! We haven't seen you in a dog's age."" Other soldiers
smiled and brought rusty cigarettes into the dug-out where they sat and
smoked.

Hugo held out his hand. ""Been busy. Glad to see you.""

""Yes. I know how busy you've been. Up and down the lines we hear about
you. _Le Colorado._ Damn funny war. You'd think you weren't human, or
anywhere near human, to hear these birds. Wish you'd tell me how you get
away with it. Hasn't one nicked you yet?""

""Not yet.""

""God damn. Got me here""--he tapped his shoulder--""and here""--his thigh.

""That's tough. I guess the sort of work I do isn't calculated to be as
risky as yours,"" Hugo said.

""Huh! That you can tell to Sweeny."" The Frenchmen were still sitting
politely, listening to a dialogue they could not understand. Hugo and
Shayne eyed each other in silence. A long, penetrating silence. At
length the latter said soberly: ""Still as enthusiastic as you were that
night in Marseilles?""

""Are you?""

""I didn't have much conception of what war would be then.""

""Neither did I,"" Hugo responded. ""And I'm not very enthusiastic any
more.""

""Oh, well--""

""Exactly.""

""Heard from your family?""

""Sure.""

""Well--""

They relapsed into silence again. By and by they ate a meal of cold
food, supplemented by rank, steaming coffee. Then they slept. Before
dawn Hugo woke feeling like a man in the mouth of a volcano that had
commenced to erupt. The universe was shaking. The walls of the dug-out
were molting chunks of earth. The scream and burst of shells were
constant. He heard Shayne's voice above the din, issuing orders in
French. Their batteries were to be phoned. A protective counter-fire. A
_barrage_ in readiness in case of attack, which seemed imminent. Larger
shells drowned the voice. Hugo rose and stood beside Shayne.

""Coming over?""

""Coming over.""

A shapeless face spoke in the gloom. The voice panted. ""We must get out
of here, my lieutenant. They are smashing in the dug-out."" A methodical
scramble to the orifice. Hell was rampaging in the trench. The shells
fell everywhere. Shayne shook his head. It was neither light nor dark.
The incessant blinding fire did not make things visible except for
fragments of time and in fantastic perspectives. Things belched and
boomed and smashed the earth and whistled and howled. It was impossible
to see how life could exist in that caldron, and yet men stood calmly
all along the line. A few of them, here and there, were obliterated.

The red sky in the southeast became redder with the rising sun. Hugo
remained close to the wall. It was no novelty for him to be under shell
fire. But at such times he felt the need of a caution with which he
could ordinarily dispense. If one of the steel cylinders found him, even
his mighty frame might not contain itself. Even he might be rent
asunder. Shayne saw him and smiled. Twenty yards away a geyser of fire
sprayed the heavens. Ten feet away a fragment of shell lashed down a
pile of sand-bags. Shayne's smile widened. Hugo returned it.

Then red fury enveloped the two men. Hugo was crushed ferociously
against the wall and liberated in the same second. He fell forward, his
ears singing and his head dizzy. He lay there, aching. Dark red stains
flowed over his face from his nose and ears. Painfully he stood up. A
soldier was watching him from a distance with alarmed eyes. Hugo
stepped. He found that locomotion was possible. The bedlam increased. It
brought a sort of madness. He remembered Shayne. He searched in the
smoking, stinking muck. He found the shoulders and part of Shayne's
head. He picked them up in his hands, disregarding the butchered ends of
the raw gobbet. White electricity crackled in his head.

He leaped to the parapet, shaking his fists. ""God damn you dirty sons of
bitches. I'll make you pay for this. You got him, got him, you bastards!
I'll shove your filthy hides down the devil's throat and through his
guts. Oh, Jesus!"" He did not feel the frantic tugging of his fellows. He
ran into that bubbling, doom-ridden chaos, waving his arms and shouting
maniacal profanities. A dozen times he was knocked down. He bled slowly
where fragments had battered him. He crossed over and paused on the
German parapet. He was like a being of steel. Bullets sprayed him. His
arms dangled and lifted. Barbed wire trailed behind him.

Down before him, shoulder to shoulder, the attacking regiments waited
for the last crescendo of the bombardment. They saw him come out of the
fury and smiled grimly. They knew such madness. They shot. He came on.
At last they could hear his voice dimly through the tumult. Someone
shouted that he was mad--to beware when he fell. Hugo jumped among them.
Bayonets rose. Hugo wrenched three knives from their wielders in one
wild clutch. His hands went out, snatching and squeezing. That was all.
No weapons, no defence. Just--hands. Whatever they caught they crushed
flat, and heads fell into those dreadful fingers, sides, legs, arms,
bellies. Bayonets slid from his tawny skin, taking his clothes. By and
by, except for his shoes, he was naked. His fingers had made a hundred
bunches of clotted pulp and then a thousand as he walked swiftly forward
in that trench. Ahead of him was a file of green; behind, a clogged row
of writhing men. Scarcely did the occupants of each new traverse see him
before they were smitten. The wounds he inflicted were monstrous. On he
walked, his voice now stilled, his breath sucking and whistling through
his teeth, his hands flailing and pinching and spurting red with every
contact. No more formidable engine of desolation had been seen by man,
no more titanic fury, no swifter and surer death. For thirty minutes he
raged through that line. The men thinned. He had crossed the attacking
front.

Then the barrage lifted. But no whistles blew. No soldiers rose. A few
raised their heads and then lay down again. Hugo stopped and went back
into the _abattoir_. He leaped to the parapet. The French saw him,
silhouetted against the sky. The second German wave, coming slowly over
a far hill, saw him and hesitated. No ragged line of advancing men. No
cacophony of rifle fire. Only that strange, savage figure. A man dipped
in scarlet, nude, dripping, panting. Slowly in that hiatus he wheeled.
His lungs thundered to the French. ""Come on, you black bastards. I've
killed them all. Come on. We'll send them down to hell.""

The officers looked and understood that something phenomenal had
happened. No Germans were coming. A man stood above their trench. ""Come,
quick!"" Hugo shouted. He saw that they did not understand. He stood an
instant, fell into the trench; and presently a shower of German corpses
flung through the air in wide arcs and landed on the very edge of the
French position. Then they came, and Hugo, seeing them, went on alone to
meet the second line. He might have forged on through that bloody swathe
to the heart of the Empire if his vitality had been endless. But, some
time in the battle, he fell unconscious on the field, and his
forward-leaning comrades, pushing back the startled enemy, found him
lying there.

They made a little knot around him, silent, quivering. ""It is the
Colorado,"" someone said. ""His friend, Shayne--it is he who was the
lieutenant just killed.""

They shook their heads and felt a strange fear of the unconscious man.
""He is breathing."" They called for stretcher-bearers. They faced the
enemy again, bent over on the stocks of their rifles, surged forward.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hugo was washed and dressed in pyjamas. His wounds had healed without
the necessity of a single stitch. He was grateful for that. Otherwise
the surgeons might have had a surprise which would have been difficult
to allay. He sat in a wheel chair, staring across a lawn. An angular
woman in an angular hat and tailored clothes was trying to engage him in
conversation.

""Is it very painful, my man?""

Hugo was seeing that trench again--the pulp and blood and hate of it.
""Not very.""

Her tongue and saliva made a noise. ""Don't tell me. I know it was. I
know how you all bleed and suffer.""

""Madam, it happens that my wounds were quite superficial.""

""Nonsense, my boy. They wouldn't have brought you to a base hospital in
that case. You can't fool me.""

""I was suffering only from exhaustion.""

She paused. He saw a gleam in her eye. ""I suppose you don't like to
talk--about things. Poor boy! But I imagine your life has been so full
of horror that it would be good for you to unburden yourself. Now tell
me, just what does it feel like to bayonet a man?""

Hugo trembled. He controlled his voice. ""Madam,"" he replied, ""it feels
exactly like sticking your finger into a warm, steaming pile of
cow-dung.""

""Oh!"" she gasped. And he heard her repeat it again in the corridor.




XIV


     ""Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Jordan Shayne,"" Hugo wrote. Then he paused in
     thought. He began again. ""I met your son in Marseilles and was with
     him most of the time until his death."" He hesitated. ""In fact, he
     died in my arms from the effect of the same shell which sent me to
     this hospital. He is buried in Carcy cemetery, on the south side.
     It is for that reason I take the liberty to address you.

     ""I thought that you would like to know some of the things that he
     did not write to you. Your son enlisted because he felt the war
     involved certain ideals that were worthy of preservation. That he
     gave his life for those ideals must be a source of pride to you. In
     training he was always controlled, kindly, unquarrelsome,
     comprehending. In battle he was aggressive, brilliant, and more
     courageous than any other man I have ever known.

     ""In October, a year ago, he was decorated for bringing in Captain
     Crouan, who was severely wounded during an attack that was
     repulsed. Under heavy shell fire Tom went boldly into no man's
     land and carried the officer from a shell pit on his back. At the
     time Tom himself sustained three wounds. He was mentioned a number
     of times in the dispatches for his leadership of attacks and
     patrols. He was decorated a second time for the capture of a German
     field officer and three of his staff, a coup which your son
     executed almost single-handed.

     ""Following his death his company made an attack to avenge him,
     which wiped out the entire enemy position along a sector nearly a
     kilometre in width and which brought a permanent advantage to the
     Allied lines. That is mute testimony of his popularity among the
     officers and men. I know of no man more worthy of the name
     'American,' no American more worthy of the words 'gentleman' and
     'hero.'

     ""I realize the slight comfort of these things, and yet I feel bound
     to tell you of them, because Tom was my friend, and his death is
     grievous to me as well as to you.

     ""Yours sincerely,

     ""(LIEUTENANT) HUGO DANNER""

Hugo posted the letter. When the answer came, he was once again in
action, the guns chugging and rumbling, the earth shaking. The reply
read:

     ""DEAR LIEUTENANT DANNER:

     ""Thank you for your letter in reference to our son. We knew that he
     had enlisted in some foreign service. We did not know of his
     death. I am having your statements checked, because, if they are
     true, I shall be one of the happiest persons alive, and his mother
     will be both happy and sad. The side of young Tom which you claim
     to have seen is one quite unfamiliar to us. At home he was always a
     waster, much of a snob, and impossible to control. It may be harsh
     to say such things of him now that he is dead, but I cannot recall
     one noble deed, one unselfish act, in his life here with us.

     ""That I have a dead son would not sadden me. Tom had been
     disinherited by us, his mother and father. But that my dead son was
     a hero makes me feel that at last, coming into the Shayne blood and
     heritage, he has atoned. And so I honour him. If the records show
     that all you said of him is true, I shall not only honour him in
     this country, but I shall come to France to pay my tribute with a
     full heart and a knowledge that neither he nor I lived in vain.

     ""Gratefully yours,

     ""R. J. SHAYNE""

Hugo reread the letter and stood awhile with wistful eyes. He remembered
Shayne's Aunt Emma, Shayne's bitter calumniation of his family. Well,
they had not understood him and he had not wanted them to understand
him. Perhaps Shayne had been more content than he admitted in the mud of
the trenches. The war had been a real thing to him. Hugo thought of its
insufficiencies for himself. The world was not enough for Shayne, but
the war had been. Both were insufficient for Hugo Danner. He listened to
the thunder in the sky tiredly.

Two months later Hugo was ordered from rest billets to the major's
quarters. A middle-aged man and woman accompanied by a sleek Frenchman
awaited him. The man stepped forward with dignified courtesy. ""I am Tom
Shayne's father. This is Mrs. Shayne.""

Hugo felt a great lack of interest in them. They had come too late. It
was their son who had been his friend. He almost regretted the letter.
He shook hands with them. Mrs. Shayne went to an automobile. Her husband
invited Hugo to a café. Over the wine he became suddenly less dignified,
more human, and almost pathetic. ""Tell me about him, Danner. I loved
that kid once, you know.""

Hugo found himself unexpectedly moved. The man was so eager, so
strangely happy. He stroked his white moustache and turned away moist
eyes. So Hugo told him. He talked endlessly of the trenches and the dark
wet nights and the fire that stabbed through them. He invented brave
sorties for his friend, tripled his accomplishments, and put gaiety and
wit in his mouth. The father drank every syllable as if he was
committing the whole story to memory as the text of a life's solace. At
last he was crying.

""That was the Tom I knew,"" Hugo said softly.

""And that was the Tom I dreamed and hoped and thought he would become
when he was a little shaver. Well, he did, Danner.""

""A thousand times he did.""

Ralph Jordan Shayne blew his nose unashamedly. He thought of his
patiently waiting wife. ""I've got to go, I suppose. This has been more
than kind of you, Mr. Danner--Lieutenant Danner. I'm glad--more glad
than I can say--that you were there. I understand from the major that
you're no small shakes in this army yourself."" He smiled deferentially.
""I wish there was something we could do for you.""

""Nothing. Thank you, Mr. Shayne.""

""I'm going to give you my card. In New York--my name is not without
meaning.""

""It is very familiar to me. Was before I met your son.""

""If you ever come to the city--I mean, when you come--you must look us
up. Anything we can do--in the way of jobs, positions--"" He was
confused.

Hugo shook his head. ""That's very kind of you, sir. But I have some
means of my own and, right now, I'm not even thinking of going back to
New York.""

Mr. Shayne stepped into the car. ""I would like to do something."" Hugo
realized the sincerity of that desire. He reflected.

""Nothing I can think of--""

""I'm a banker. Perhaps--if I might take the liberty--I could handle your
affairs?""

Hugo smiled. ""My affairs consist of one bank account in the City Loan
that would seem very small to you, Mr. Shayne.""

""Why, that's one of my banks. I'll arrange it. You know and I know how
small the matter of money is. But I'd appreciate your turning over some
of your capital to me. I would consider it a blessed opportunity to
return a service, a great service with a small one, I'm afraid.""

""Thanks,"" Hugo said.

The banker scribbled a statement, asked a question, and raised his
eyebrows over the amount Hugo gave him. Then he was the father again.
""We've been to the cemetery, Danner. We owe that privilege to you. It
says there, in French: 'The remains of a great hero who gave his life
for France.' Not America, my boy; but I think that France was a worthy
cause.""

When they had gone, Hugo spent a disturbed afternoon. He had not been so
moved in many, many months.




XV


Now the streets of Paris were assailed by the colour of olive drab, the
twang of Yankee accents, the music of Broadway songs. Hugo watched the
first parade with eyes somewhat proud and not a little sombre. Each
shuffling step seemed to ask a rhythmic question. Who would not return
to Paris? Who would return once and not again? Who would be blind? Who
would be hideous? Who would be armless, legless, who would wear silver
plates and leather props for his declining years? Hugo wondered, and,
looking into those sometimes stern and sometimes ribald faces, he saw
that they had not yet commenced to wonder.

They did not know the hammer and shock of falling shells and the jelly
and putty which men became. They chafed and bantered and stormed every
café and cocotte impartially, recklessly. Even the Legion had been more
grim and better prepared for the iron feet of war. They fell upon Hugo
with their atrocious French--two young men who wanted a drink and could
not make the bar-tender understand.

""Hey, _fransay_,"" they called to him, ""_comment dire que nous voulez des
choses boire?_""

Hugo smiled. ""What do you birds want to drink?""

""God Almighty! Here's a Frog that speaks United States. Get the gang.
What's your name, bo?""

""Danner.""

""Come on an' have a flock of drinks on us. You're probably dying on
French pay. You order for the gang and we'll treat."" Eager, grinning
American faces. ""Can you get whisky in this God-forsaken dump?""

""Straight or highball?""

""That's the talk. Straight, Dan. We're in the army now.""

Hugo drank with them. Only for one moment did they remember they were in
the army to fight: ""Say, Dan, the war really isn't as tough as they
claim, is it?""

""I don't know how tough they claim it is.""

""Well, you seen much fightin'?""

""Three years.""

""Is it true that the Heinies--?"" His hands indicated his question.

""Sometimes. Accidentally, more or less. You can't help it.""

""And do them machine guns really mow 'em down?""

Hugo shrugged. ""There are only four men in service now who started with
my company.""

""Ouch! _Garçon! Encore!_ An' tell him to make it double--no,
triple--Dan, old man. It may be my last."" To Hugo: ""Well, it's about
time we got here an' took the war off your shoulders. You guys sure have
had a bellyful. An' I'm goin' to get me one right here and now. Bottoms
up, you guys.""

Hugo was transferred to an American unit. The officers belittled the
recommendations that came with him. They put him in the ranks. He served
behind the lines for a week. Then his regiment moved up. As soon as the
guns began to rumble, a nervous second lieutenant edged toward the
demoted private. ""Say, Danner, you've been in this before. Do you think
it's all right to keep on along this road the way we are?""

""I'm sure I couldn't say. You're taking a chance. Plane strafing and
shells.""

""Well, what else are we to do? These are our orders.""

""Nothing,"" Hugo said.

When the first shells fell among them, however, Danner forgot that his
transference had cost his commission and sadly bereft Captain Crouan and
his command. He forgot his repressed anger at the stupidity of American
headquarters and their bland assumption of knowledge superior to that
gained by three years of actual fighting. He virtually took charge of
his company, ignoring the bickering of a lieutenant who swore and
shouted and accomplished nothing and who was presently beheaded for his
lack of caution. A month later, with troops that had some feeling of
respect for the enemy--a feeling gained through close and gory
association--Hugo was returned his commission.

Slowly at first, and with increasing momentum, the war was pushed up out
of the trenches and the Germans retreated. The summer that filled the
windows of American homes with gold stars passed. Hugo worked like a
slave out beyond the front trenches, scouting, spying, destroying,
salvaging, bending his heart and shoulders to a task that had long since
become an acid routine. September. October. November. The end of that
holocaust was very near.

Then there came a day warmer than the rest and less rainy. Hugo was
riding toward the lines on a _camion_. He rode as much as possible now.
He had not slept for two days. His eyes were red and twitching. He felt
tired--tired as if his fatigue were the beginning of death--tired so
that nothing counted or mattered--tired of killing, of hating, of
suffering--tired even of an ideal that had tarnished through long
weathering. The _camion_ was steel and it rattled and bumped as it moved
over the road. Hugo lay flat in it, trying to close his eyes.

After a time, moving between the stumps of a row of poplars, they came
abreast of a regiment returning from the battle. They walked slowly and
dazedly. Each individual was still amazed at being alive after the
things he had witnessed. Hugo raised himself and looked at them. The
same expression had often been on the faces of the French. The long line
of the regiment ended. Then there was an empty place on the road, and
the speed of the truck increased.

Finally it stopped with a sharp jar, and the driver shouted that he
could go no farther. Hugo clambered to the ground. He estimated that the
battery toward which he was travelling was a mile farther. He began to
walk. There was none of the former lunge and stride in his steps. He
trudged, rather, his head bent forward. A little file of men approached
him, and, even at a distance, he did not need a second glance to
identify them. Walking wounded.

By ones and twos they began to pass him. He paid scant attention. Their
field dressings were stained with the blood that their progress cost.
They cursed and muttered. Someone had given them cigarettes, and a dozen
wisps of smoke rose from each group. It was not until he reached the end
of the straggling line that he looked up. Then he saw one man whose arms
were both under bandage walking with another whose eyes were covered and
whose hand, resting on his companion's shoulder, guided his stumbling
feet.

Hugo viewed them as they came on and presently heard their conversation.
""Christ, it hurts,"" one of them said.

""The devil with hurting, boy,"" the blinded man answered. ""So do I, for
that matter. I feel like there was a hot poker in my brains.""

""Want another butt?""

""No, thanks. Makes me kind of sick to drag on them. Wish I had a drink,
though.""

""Who doesn't?""

Hugo heard his voice. ""Hey, you guys,"" it said. ""Here's some water. And
a shot of cognac, too.""

The first man stopped and the blind man ran into him, bumping his head.
He gasped with pain, but his lips smiled. ""Damn nice of you, whoever you
are.""

They took the canteen and swallowed. ""Go on,"" Hugo said, and permitted
himself a small lie. ""I can get more in a couple of hours."" He produced
his flask. ""And finish off on a shot of this.""

He held the containers for the armless man and handed them to the other.
Their clothes were ragged and stained. Their shoes were in pieces. Sweat
had soaked under the blind man's armpits and stained his tunic. As Hugo
watched him swallow thirstily, he started. The chin and the hair were
familiar. His mind spun. He knew the voice, although its tenor was sadly
changed.

""Good God,"" he said involuntarily, ""it's Lefty!""

Lefty stiffened. ""Who are you?""

""Hugo Danner.""

""Hugo Danner?"" The tortured brain reflected.

""Hugo! Good old Hugo! What, in the name of Jesus, are you doing here?""

""Same thing you are.""

An odd silence fell. The man with the shattered arms broke it. ""Know
this fellow?""

""Do I know him! Gee! He was at college with me. One of my buddies.
Gosh!"" His hand reached out. ""Put it there, Hugo.""

They shook hands. ""Got it bad, Lefty?""

The bound head shook. ""Not so bad. I guess--I kind of feel that I won't
be able to see much any more. Eyes all washed out. Got mustard gas in
'em. But I'll be all right, you know. A little thing like that's
nothing. Glad to be alive. Still have my sex appeal, anyhow. Still got
the old appetite. But--listen--what happened to you? Why in hell did you
quit? Woodman nearly went crazy looking for you.""

""Oh--"" Hugo's thoughts went back a distance that seemed infinite, into
another epoch and another world--""oh, I just couldn't stick it. Say, you
guys, wait a minute."" He turned. His _camion_-driver was lingering in
the distance. ""Wait here."" He rushed back. The armless man whistled.

""God in heaven! Your friend there can sure cover the ground.""

""Yeah,"" Lefty said absently. ""He always could.""

In a moment Hugo returned. ""I got it all fixed up for you two to ride
in. No limousine, but it'll carry you.""

Lefty's lip trembled. ""Gee--Jesus Christ--"" he amended stubbornly;
""that's decent. I don't feel so dusty to-day. Damn it, if I had any
eyes, I guess I'd cry. Must be the cognac.""

""Nothing at all, Lefty old kid. Here, I'll give you a hand."" He took
Lefty's arm over his shoulder, encircled him with his own, and carried
him rapidly over the broken road.

""Still got the old fight,"" Lefty murmured as he felt himself rushed
forward.

""Still.""

""Been in this mess long?""

""Since the beginning.""

""I should have thought of that. I often wondered what became of you.
Iris used to wonder, too.""

""How is she?""

""All right.""

They reached the truck. Lefty sat down on the metal bottom with a sigh.
""Thanks, old bean. I was just about _kaputt_. Tough going, this war. I
saw my first shell fall yesterday. Never saw a single German at all. One
of those squdgy things came across, and before I knew it, there was
onion in my eye for a goal."" The truck motor roared. The armless man
came alongside and was lifted beside Lefty. ""Well, Hugo, so long. You
sure were a friend in need. Never forget it. And look me up when the
Krauts are all dead, will you?"" The gears clashed. ""Thanks again--and
for the cognac, too."" He waved airily. ""See you later.""

Hugo stalked back on the road. Once he looked over his shoulder. The
truck was a blur of dust. ""See you later. See you later. See you later.""
Lefty would never see him later--never see anyone ever.

That night he sat in a quiet stupor, all thought of great ideal, of fine
abandon, of the fury of justice, and all flagrant phrases brought to an
abrupt end by the immediate claims of his own sorrow. Tom Shayne was
blasted to death. The stinging horror of mustard had fallen into Lefty's
eyes. All the young men were dying. The friendships he had made, the
human things that gave in memory root to the earth were ripped up and
shrivelled. That seemed grossly wrong and patently ignoble. He discarded
his personal travail. It was nothing. His life had been comprised of
attempt and failure, of disappointment and misunderstanding; he was
accustomed to witness the blunting of the edge of his hopes and the
dulling of his desires when they were enacted.

Even his great sacrifice had been vain. It was always thus. His deeds
frightened men or made them jealous. When he conceived a fine thing, the
masses, individually or collectively, transformed it into something
cheap. His fort in the forest had been branded a hoax. His effort to
send himself through college and to rescue Charlotte from an unpleasant
life had ended in vulgar comedy. Even that had been her triumph, her
hour, and an incongruous strain of greatness had filtered through her
personality rather than his. Now his years in the war were reduced to
no grandeur, to a mere outlet for his savage instinct to destroy. After
such a life, he reflected, he could no longer visualize himself engaged
in any search for a comprehension of real values.

His mind was thorny with doubts. Seeing himself as a man made
hypocritical by his gifts and the narrowness of the world, discarding
his own problem as tragically solved, Hugo then looked upon the war as
the same sort of colossal error. A waste. Useless, hopeless, gaining
nothing but the temporal power which it so blatantly disavowed, it had
exacted the price of its tawdry excitement in lives, and, now that it
was almost finished, mankind was ready to emerge blank-faced and
panting, no better off than before.

His heart ached as he thought of the toil, the effort, the energy and
hope and courage that had been spilled over those mucky fields to
satisfy the lusts and foolish hates of the demagogues. He was no longer
angry. The memory of Lefty sitting smilingly on the van and calling that
he would see him later was too sharp an emotion to permit brain storms
and pyrotechnics.

If he could but have ended the war single-handed, it might have been
different. But he was not great enough for that. He had been a thousand
men, perhaps ten thousand, but he could not be millions. He could not
wrap his arms around a continent and squeeze it into submission. There
were too many people and they were too stupid to do more than fear him
and hate him. Sitting there, he realized that his naïve faith in
himself and the universe had foundered. The war was only another war
that future generations would find romantic to contemplate and dull to
study. He was only a species of genius who had missed his mark by a
cosmic margin.

When he considered his failure, he believed that he was not thinking
about himself. There he was, entrusted with special missions which he
accomplished no one knew how, and no one questioned in those hectic
days. Those who had seen him escape machine-gun fire, carry tons, leap a
hundred yards, kill scores, still clung to their original concepts of
mankind and discredited the miracle their own eyes had witnessed. Too
many strange things happened in that blasting carnival of destruction
for one strange sight or one strange man to leave a great mark. Personal
security was at too great a premium to leave much room for interest and
speculation. Even Captain Crouan believed he was only a man of freak
strength and Major Ingalls in his present situation was too busy to do
more than note that Hugo was capable and nod his head when Hugo reported
another signal victory, ascribing it to his long experience in the war
rather than to his peculiar abilities.

As he sat empty-eyed in the darkness, smoking cigarettes and breathing
in his own and the world's tragic futility, his own and the world's
abysmal sorrow, that stubborn ancestral courage and determination that
was in him still continued to lash his reason. ""Even if the war is not
worth while,"" it whispered, ""you have committed yourself to it. You are
bound and pledged to see it to the bitter end. You cannot finish it on a
declining note. To-night, to-morrow, you must begin again."" At the same
time his lust for carnage stirred within him like a long-subdued demon.
Now he recognized it and knew that it must be mastered. But it combined
with his conscience to quicken his sinews anew.

It was a cold night, but Hugo perspired. Was he to go again into the
holocaust to avenge a friend? Was he to live over those crimson seconds
that followed the death of Shayne, all because he had helped a blind
friend into a _camion_? He knew that he was not. Never again could his
instinct so triumph over his reason. That was the greatest danger in
being Hugo Danner. That, he commenced to see, was the explanation of all
his suffering in the past. The idea warmed and encouraged him.
Henceforth his emotions and sentiments would be buried even deeper than
his first inbred caution had buried them. He would be a creature of
intelligence, master of his caprice as well as of the power he possessed
to carry out that caprice.

He lit a fresh cigarette and planned what he would do. On the next night
he would prepare himself very carefully. He would eat enormously,
provide himself with food and water, rest as much as he could, and then
start south and east in a plane. He would drive it far into Germany.
When its petrol failed, he would crash it. Stepping from the ruins, he
would hasten on in the darkness, on, on, like Pheidippides, till he
reached the centre of the enemy government. There, crashing through the
petty human barriers, he would perform his last feat, strangling the
Emperor, slaying the generals, pulling the buildings apart with his
Samsonian arms, and disrupting the control of the war.

He had dreamed of such an enterprise even before he had enlisted. But he
had known that he lacked sufficient stamina without a great internal
cause, and no rage, no blood-madness, was great enough to drive him to
that effort. With amazement he realized that a clenched determination
depending on the brain rather than the emotions was a greater catalyst
than any passion. He knew that he could do such a thing. In the warmth
of that knowledge he completed his plan tranquilly and retired. For
twelve hours, by order undisturbed, Hugo slept.

In the bright morning, he girded himself. He requisitioned the plane he
needed through Major Ingalls. He explained that requirement by saying
that he was going to bomb a battery of big guns. The plane offered was
an old one. Hugo had seen enough of flying in his French service to
understand its navigation. He ate the huge meal he had planned. And
then, a cool and grim man, he made his way to the hangar. In fifteen
minutes his last adventure would have commenced. But a dispatch rider,
charging on to the field in a roaring motor cycle, announced the
signing of the Armistice and the end of the war.

Hugo stood near his plane when he heard the news. Two men at his side
began to cry, one repeating over and over: ""And I'm still alive, so help
me God. I wish I was dead, like Joey."" Hugo was rigid. His first gesture
was to lift his clenched fist and search for an object to smash with it.
The fist lingered in the air. His rage passed--rage that would have
required a giant vent had it occurred two days sooner. He relaxed. His
arm fell. He ruffled his black hair; his blacker eyes stared and then
twinkled. His lips smiled for the first time in many months. His great
shoulders sagged. ""I should have guessed it,"" he said to himself, and
entered the rejoicing with a fervour that was unexpected.




XVI


There must be in heaven a certain god--a paunchy, cynical god whose task
it is to arrange for each of the birthward-marching souls a set of
circumstances so nicely adjusted to its character that the result of its
life, in triumph or defeat, will be hinged on the finest of threads. So
Hugo must have felt coming home from war. He had celebrated the
Armistice hugely, not because it had spared his life--most of the pomp,
parade, bawdiness, and glory had originated in such a deliverance--but
because it had rescued him from the hot blast of destructiveness. An
instantaneous realization of that prevented despair. He had failed in
the hour of becoming death itself; such failure was fortunate because
life to him, even at the end of the war, seemed more the effort of
creation than the business of annihilation.

To know that had cost a struggle--a struggle that took place at the
hangar as the dispatch-bearer rode up and that remained crucial only
between the instant when he lifted his fist and when he lowered it.
Brevity made it no less intense; a second of time had resolved his soul
afresh, had redistilled it and recombined it.

Not long after that he started back to America. The mass of soldiers
surrounding him were undergoing a transition that Hugo felt vividly.
These men would wake up sweating at night and cry out until someone
whispered roughly that there were no more submarines. A door would slam
and one of them would begin to weep. There were whisperings and
bickerings about life at home, about what each person, disintegrated
again to individuality, would do and say and think. Little fears about
lost jobs and lost girls cropped out, were thrust back, came finally to
remain. And no one wanted life to be what it had been; no one considered
that it could be the same.

Hugo wrote to his family that the war was ended, that he was well, that
he expected to see them some time in the near future. The ship that
carried him reached the end of the blue sea; he was disembarked and
demobilized in New York. He realized even before he was accustomed to
the novelty of civilian clothes that a familiar, friendly city had
changed. The retrospective spell of the eighties and nineties had
vanished. New York was brand-new, blatant, rushing, prosperous. The
inheritance from Europe had been assimilated; a social reality, entirely
foreign and American, had been wrought and New York was ready to spread
it across the parent world. Those things were pressed quickly into
Hugo's mind by his hotel, the magazines, a chance novel of the precise
date, the cinema, and the more general, more indefinite human pulses.

After a few days of random inspection, of casual imbibing, he called
upon Tom Shayne's father. He would have preferred to escape all painful
reminiscing, but he went partly as a duty and partly from necessity: he
had no money whatever.

A butler opened the door of a large stone mansion and ushered Hugo to
the library, where Mr. Shayne rose eagerly. ""I'm so glad you came. Knew
you'd be here soon. How are you?""

Hugo was slightly surprised. In his host's manner was the hardness and
intensity that he had observed everywhere. ""I'm very well, thanks.""

""Splendid! Cocktails, Smith.""

There was a pause. Mr. Shayne smiled. ""Well, it's over, eh?""

""Yes.""

""All over. And now we've got to beat the spears into plowshares, eh?""

""We have.""

Mr. Shayne chuckled. ""Some of my spears were already made into plows,
and it was a great season for the harvest, young man--a great season.""

Hugo was still uncertain of Mr. Shayne's deepest viewpoint. His
uncertainty nettled him. ""The grim reaper has done some harvesting on
his own account--"" He spoke almost rudely.

Mr. Shayne frowned disapprovingly. ""I made up my mind to forget, Danner.
To forget and to buckle down. And I've done both. You'll want to know
what happened to the funds I handled for you--""

""I wasn't particularly--""

The older man shook his head with grotesque coyness. ""Not so fast, not
so fast. You were particularly eager to hear. We're getting honest about
our emotions in this day and place. You're eaten with impatience.
Well--I won't hold out. Danner, I've made you a million. A clean, cold
million.""

Hugo had been struggling in a rising tide of incomprehension; that
statement engulfed him. ""Me? A million?""

""In the bank in your name waiting for a blonde girl.""

""I'm afraid I don't exactly understand, Mr. Shayne.""

The banker readjusted his glasses and swallowed a cocktail by tipping
back his head. Then he rose, paced across the broad carpet, and faced
Hugo. ""Of course you don't understand. Well, I'll tell you about it.
Once you did a favour for me which has no place in this conversation.""
He hesitated; his face seemed to flinch and then to be jerked back to
its former expression. ""In return I've done a little for you. And I want
to add a word to the gift of your bank book. You have, if you're
careful, leisure to enjoy life, freedom, the world at your feet. No
more strife for you, no worry, and no care. Take it. Be a hedonist.
There is nothing else. I've lain in bed nights enjoying the life that
lies ahead of you, my boy. Vicariously voluptuous. Catchy phrase, isn't
it? My own. I want to see you do it up brown.""

Hugo rubbed his hand across his forehead. It was not long ago that this
same man had sat at an _estaminet_ and wept over snatches of a childhood
which death had made sacred. Here he stood now, asking that a life be
done up brown, and meaning cheap, obvious things. He wished that he had
never called on Tom's father.

""That wasn't my idea of living--"" he said slowly.

""It will be. Forget the war. It was a dream. I realized it suddenly. If
I had not, I would still be--just a banker. Not a great banker. The
great banker. I saw, suddenly, that it was a dream. The world was mad.
So I took my profit from it, beginning on the day I saw.""

""How, exactly?""

""Eh?""

""I mean--how did you profit by the war?""

Mr. Shayne smiled expansively. ""What was in demand then, my boy? What
were the stupid, traduced, misguided people raising billions to get?
What? Why, shells, guns, foodstuffs. For six months I had a corner on
four chemicals vitally necessary to the government. And the government
got them--at my price. I owned a lot of steel. I mixed food and
diplomacy in equal parts--and when the pie was opened, it was full of
solid gold.""

Hugo's voice was strange. ""And that is the way--my money was made?""

""It is."" Mr. Shayne perceived that Hugo was angry. ""Now, don't get
sentimental. Keep your eye on the ball. I--"" He did not finish, because
Mrs. Shayne came into the room. Hugo stared at him fixedly, his face
livid, for several seconds before he was conscious of her. Even then it
was only a partial consciousness.

She was stuffed into a tight, bright dress. She was holding out her
hand, holding his hand, holding his hand too long. There was mascara
around her eyes and they dilated and blinked in a foolish and
flirtatious way; her voice was syrup. She was taking a cocktail with the
other hand--maybe if he gave her hand a real squeeze, she would let go.
A tall, sallow young man had come in behind her; he was Mr. Jerome
Leonardo Bateau, a perfect dear. Mrs. Shayne was still holding his hand
and murmuring; Mr. Shayne was patting his shoulder; Mr. Bateau was
staring with haughty and jealous eyes. Hugo excused himself.

In the hall he asked for Mr. Shayne's secretary. He collected himself in
a few frigid sentences. ""Please tell Mr. Shayne I am very grateful. I
wish to transfer my entire fortune to my parents in Indian Creek,
Colorado. The name is Abednego Danner. Make all arrangements.""

A faint ""But--"" followed him futilely through the door. In the space of
a block he had cut a pace that set other pedestrians gaping to a fast
walk.




XVII


Hugo sat in Madison Square Park giving his attention in a circuit to the
Flatiron Building, the clock on the Metropolitan Tower, and the creeping
barrage of traffic that sent people scampering, stopped, moved forward
again. He had sat on the identical bench at the identical time of day
during his obscure undergraduate period. To repeat that contemplative
stasis after so much living had intervened ought to have produced an
emotion. He had gone to the park with that idea. But the febrile fires
of feeling were banked under the weight of many things and he could
suffer nothing, enjoy nothing and think but one fragmentary routine.

He had tried much and made no progress. He would be forced presently to
depart on a different course from a new threshold. That idea went round
and round in his head like a single fly in a big room. It lost poignancy
and eventually it lost meaning. Still he sat in feeble sunshine trying
to move beyond stagnancy. He remembered the small man with the huge
roll of bills who had moved beside him and asked for a cup of coffee. He
remembered the woman who had robbed him; silk ankles crossed his line of
vision, and a gusty appetite vaporized even as it steamed into the
coldness of his indecision.

He was without money now, as he had been then, so long ago. He budged on
the bench and challenged himself to think.

What would you do if you were the strongest man in the world, the
strongest thing in the world, mightier than the machine? He made himself
guess answers for that rhetorical query. ""I would--I would have won the
war. But I did not. I would run the universe single-handed. Literally
single-handed. I would scorn the universe and turn it to my own ends. I
would be a criminal. I would rip open banks and gut them. I would kill
and destroy. I would be a secret, invisible blight. I would set out to
stamp crime off the earth; I would be a super-detective, following and
summarily punishing every criminal until no one dared to commit a
felony. What would I do? What will I do?""

Then he realized that he was hungry. He had not eaten enough in the last
few days. Enough for him. With some intention of finding work he had
left Mr. Shayne's house. A call on the telephone from Mr. Shayne himself
volunteering a position had crystallized that intention. In three days
he had discovered the vast abundance of young men, the embarrassment of
young men, who were walking along the streets looking for work. He who
had always worked with his arms and shoulders had determined to try to
earn his living with his head. But the white-collar ranks were teeming,
overflowing, supersaturated. He went down in the scale of clerkships and
inexperienced clerkships. There was no work.

Thence he had gone to the park, and presently he rose. He had seen the
clusters of men on Sixth Avenue standing outside the employment
agencies. He could go there. Any employment was better than hunger--and
he had learned that hunger could come swiftly and formidably to him.
Business was slack, hands were being laid off; where an apprentice was
required, three trained men waited avidly for work. It was appalling and
Hugo saw it as appalling. He was not frightened, but, as he walked, he
knew that it was a mistake to sit in the park with the myriad other men.
Walking made him feel better. It was action, it bred the thought that
any work was better than none. Work would not hinder his dreams,
meantime.

When he reached Forty-second Street he could see the sullen, watchful
groups of men. He joined one of them. A loose-jointed, dark-faced person
came down a flight of stairs, wrote on a blackboard in chalk, and went
up again. Several of the group detached themselves and followed him--to
compete for a chance to wash windows.

A man at his side spoke to him. ""Tough, ain't it, buddy?""

""Yeah, it's tough,"" Hugo said.

""I got three bones left. Wanna join me in a feed an' get a job
afterward?""

Hugo looked into his eyes. They were troubled and desirous of
companionship. ""No, thanks,"" he replied.

They waited for the man to scribble again in chalk.

""They was goin' to fix up everybody slick after the war. Oh, hell, yes.""

""You in it?"" Hugo asked.

""Up to my God-damned neck, buddy.""

""Me, too. Guess I'll go up the line.""

""I'll go witcha.""

""Well--""

They waited a moment longer, for the man with the chalk had reappeared.
Hugo's comrade grunted. ""Wash windows an' work in the steel mills. Break
your neck or burn your ear off. Wha' do they care?"" Hugo had taken a
step toward the door, but the youth with the troubled eyes caught his
sleeve. ""Don't go up for that, son. They burn you in them steel mills. I
seen guys afterward. Two years an' you're all done. This is tough, but
that's tougher. Sweet Jesus, I'll say it is.""

Hugo loosened himself. ""Gotta eat, buddy. I don't happen to have even
three bones available at the moment.""

The man looked after him. ""Gosh,"" he murmured. ""Even guys like that.""

He was in a dingy room standing before a grilled window. A voice from
behind it asked his name, age, address, war record. Hugo was handed a
piece of paper to sign and then a second piece that bore the scrawled
words: ""Amalgamated Crucible Steel Corp., Harrison, N. J.""

Hugo's emotional life was reawakened when he walked into the mills. His
last nickel was gone. He had left the train at the wrong station and
walked more than a mile. He was hungry and cold. He came, as if naked,
to the monster and he did it homage.

Its predominant colour scheme was black and red. It had a loud, pagan
voice. It breathed fire. It melted steel and rock and drank human sweat,
with human blood for an occasional stimulant. On every side of him were
enormous buildings and woven between them a plaid of girders, cables,
and tracks across which masses of machinery moved. Inside, Thor was
hammering. Inside, a crane sped overhead like a tarantula, trailing its
viscera to the floor, dangling a gigantic iron rib. A white speck in its
wounded abdomen was a human face.

The bright metal gushed from another hole. It was livid and partially
alive; it was hot and had a smell; it swept away the thought of the dark
descending night. It made a pool in a great ladle; it made a cupful
dipped from a river in hell. A furnace exhaled sulphurously, darting a
snake's tongue into the sky. The mills roared and the earth shook. It
was bestial, reptilian--labour, and the labour of creation, and the
engine that turned the earth could be no more terrible.

Hugo, standing sublimely small in its midst, measured his strength
against it, soaked up its warmth, shook his fist at it, and shouted in a
voice that could not be heard for a foot: ""Christ Almighty! This--is
something!""

""Name?""

""Hugo Danner.""

""Address?""

""None at present.""

""Experience?""

""None.""

""Married?""

""No.""

""Union?""

""What?""

""Lemme see your union card.""

""I don't belong.""

""Well, you gotta join.""

He went to the headquarters of the union. Men were there of all sorts.
The mills were taking on hands. There was reconstruction to be done
abroad and steel was needed. They came from Europe, for the most part.
Thickset, square-headed, small-eyed men. Men with expressionless faces
and bulging muscles that held more meaning than most countenances. They
gave him room and no more. They answered the same questions that he
answered. He stood in a third queue with them, belly to back, mouths
closed. He was sent to a lodging-house, advanced five dollars, and told
that he would be boarded and given a bed and no more until the
employment agency had taken its commission, and the union its dues. He
signed a paper. He went on the night shift without supper.

He ran a wheelbarrow filled with heavy, warm slag for a hundred feet
over a walk of loose bricks. The job was simple. Load, carry, dump,
return, load. On some later night he would count the number of loads.
But on this first night he walked with excited eyes, watching the
tremendous things that happened all around him. Men ran the machinery
that dumped the ladle. Men guided liquid iron from the furnaces into a
maze of channels and cloughs, clearing the way through the sand, cutting
off the stream, making new openings. Men wheeled the slag and steered
the trains and trams and cranes. Men operated the hammers. And almost
all of the men were nude to the waist, sleek and shining with sweat;
almost all of them drank whisky.

One of the men in the wheelbarrow line even offered a drink to Hugo. He
held out the flask and bellowed in Czech. Hugo took it. The drink was
raw and foul. Pouring into his empty stomach, it had a powerful effect,
making him exalted, making him work like a demon. After a long, noisy
time that did not seem long a steam whistle screamed faintly and the
shift was ended.

The Czech accompanied Hugo through the door. The new shift was already
at work. They went out. A nightmare of brilliant orange and black fled
from Hugo's vision and he looked into the pale, remote chiaroscuro of
dawn.

""Me tired,"" the Czech said in a small, aimless tone.

They flung themselves on dirty beds in a big room. But Hugo did not
sleep for a time--not until the sun rose and day was evident in the
grimy interior of the bunk house.

That he could think while he worked had been Hugo's thesis when he
walked up Sixth Avenue. Now, working steadily, working at a thing that
was hard for other men and easy for him, he nevertheless fell into the
stolid vacuum of the manual labourer. The mills became familiar, less
fantastic. He remembered that oftentimes the war had given a more
dramatic passage of man's imagination forged into fire and steel.

His task was changed numerous times. For a while he puddled pig iron
with the long-handled, hoe-like tool.

""Don't slip in,"" they said. It was succinct, graphic.

Then they put him on the hand cars that fed the furnaces. It was
picturesque, daring, and for most men too hard. Few could manage the
weight or keep up with the pace. Those who did were honoured by their
fellows. The trucks were moved forward by human strength and dumped by
hand-windlasses. Occasionally, they said, you became tired and fell
into the furnace. Or jumped. If you got feeling woozy, they said, quit.
The high rails and red mouths were hypnotic, like burning Baal and the
Juggernaut.

Hugo's problems had been abandoned. He worked as hard as he dared. The
presence of grandeur and din made him content. How long it would have
lasted is uncertain; not forever. On the day when he had pushed up two
hundred and three loads during his shift, the boss stopped him in the
yard.

A tall, lean, acid man. He caught Hugo's sleeve and turned him round.
""You're one of the bastards on the furnace line.""

""Yes.""

""How many cars did you push up to-day?""

""Two hundred and three.""

""What the hell do you think this is, anyway?""

""I don't get you.""

""Oh, you don't, huh? Well, listen here, you God-damned athlete, what are
you trying to do? You got the men all sore--wearing themselves out. I
had to lay off three--why? Because they couldn't keep up with you,
that's why. Because they got their guts in a snarl trying to bust your
record. What do you think you're in? A race? Somebody's got to show you
your place around here and I think I'll just kick a lung out right now.""

The boss had worked himself into a fury. He became conscious of an
audience of workers. Hugo smiled. ""I wouldn't advise you to try
that--even if you are a big guy.""

""What was that?"" The words were roared. He gathered himself, but when
Hugo did not flinch, did not prepare himself, he was suddenly startled.
He remembered, perhaps, the two hundred and three cars. He opened his
fist. ""All right. I ain't even goin' to bother myself tryin' to break
you in to this game. Get out.""

""What?""

""Get out. Beat it. I'm firing you.""

""Firing me? For working too hard?"" Hugo laughed. He bent double with
laughter. His laughter sounded above the thunder of the mill. ""Oh, God,
that's funny. Fire me!"" He moved toward the boss menacingly. ""I've a
notion to twist your liver around your neck myself.""

The workers realized that an event of some magnitude was taking place.
They drew nearer. Hugo's laughter came again and changed into a
smile--an emotion that cooled visibly. Then swiftly he peeled up the
sleeve of his shirt. His fist clenched; his arm bent; under the nose of
his boss he caused his mighty biceps to swell. His whole body trembled.
With his other hand he took the tall man's fingers and laid them on that
muscle.

""Squeeze,"" he shouted.

The boss squeezed. His face grew pallid and he let go suddenly. He tried
to speak through his dry mouth, but Hugo had turned his back. At the
brick gate post he paused and drew a breath.

His words resounded like the crack of doom. ""So long!""




XVIII


In the next four weeks Hugo knew the pangs of hunger frequently. He
found odd jobs, but none of them lasted. Once he helped to remove a late
snowstorm from the streets. He worked for five days on a subway
excavation. His clothes became shabby, he began to carry his razor in
his overcoat pocket and to sleep in hotels that demanded only
twenty-five cents for a night's lodging. When he considered the tens of
thousands of men in his predicament, he was not surprised at or ashamed
of himself. When, however, he dwelt on his own peculiar capacities, he
was both astonished and ashamed to meander along the dreary pavements.

Hunger did curious things to him. He had moments of fury, of imagined
violence, and other moments of fantasy when he dreamed of a rich and
noble life. Sometimes he meditated the wisdom of devouring one
prodigious meal and fleeing through the dead of night to the warm south.
Occasionally he considered going back to his family in Colorado. His
most bitter hours were spent in thinking of Mr. Shayne and of accepting
a position in one of Mr. Shayne's banks.

In his maculate, threadbare clothes, with his dark, aquiline face
matured by the war he was a sharp contrast of facts and possibilities.
It never occurred to him that he was young, that his dissatisfaction,
his idealism, his _Weltschmertz_ were integral to the life-cycle of
every man.

At the end of four weeks, with hunger gnawing so avidly at his core that
he could not pass a restaurant without twitching muscles and quivering
nerves, he turned abruptly from the street into a cigar store and
telephoned to Mr. Shayne. The banker was full of sound counsel and ready
charity. Hugo regretted the call as soon as he heard Mr. Shayne's voice;
he regretted it when he was ravishing a luxurious dinner at Mr. Shayne's
expense. It was the weakest thing he had done in his life.

Nevertheless he accepted the position offered by Mr. Shayne. That same
evening he rented a small apartment, and, lying on his bed, a clean bed,
he wondered if he really cared about anything or about anyone. In the
morning he took a shower and stood for a long time in front of the
mirror on the bathroom door, staring at his nude body as if it were a
rune he might learn to read, an enigma he might solve by concentration.
Then he went to work. His affiliation with the Down Town Savings Bank
lasted into the spring and was terminated by one of the oddest
incidents of his career.

Until the day of that incident his incumbency was in no way unusual. He
was one of the bank's young men, receiving fifty dollars weekly to learn
the banking business. They moved him from department to department,
giving him mentally menial tasks which afforded him in each case a
glimpse of a new facet of financial technique. It was fairly
interesting. He made no friends and he worked diligently.

One day in April when he had returned from lunch and a stroll in the
environs of the Battery--returned to a list of securities and a strip
from an adding machine, which he checked item by item--he was conscious
of a stirring in his vicinity. A woman employee on the opposite side of
a wire wicket was talking shrilly. A vice-president rose from his desk
and hastened down the corridor, his usually composed face suddenly white
and disconcerted. The tension was cumulative. Work stopped and clusters
of people began to chatter. Hugo joined one of them.

""Yeah,"" a boy was saying, ""it's happened before. A couple o' times.""

""How do they know he's there?""

""They got a telephone goin' inside and they're talkin' to him.""

""I'll be damned.""

The boy nodded rapidly. ""Yeah--some talk! Tellin' him what to try
next.""

""Poor devil!""

""What's the matter?"" Hugo asked.

The boy was glad of a new and uninformed listener. ""Aw, some dumb vault
clerk got himself locked in, an' the locks jammed an' they can't get him
out.""

""Which vault? The big one?""

""Naw. The big one's got pipes for that kinda trouble. The little one
they moved from the old building.""

""It's not so darn little at that,"" someone said.

Another person, a man, chuckled. ""Not so darn. But there isn't air in
there to last three hours. Caughlin said so.""

""Honest to God?""

""Honest. An' he's been there more than an hour already.""

""Jeest!"" There was a pregnant, pictorial silence. Someone looked at
Hugo.

""What's eatin' you, Danner? Scared?""

His face was tense and his hands were opening and closing convulsively.
""No,"" he answered. ""Guess I'll go down and have a look.""

He rang for an elevator in the corridor and was carried to the basement.
In the small room on which the vault opened were five or six people,
among them a woman who seemed to command the situation. The men were all
smoking; their attitudes were relaxed, their voices hushed.

One repeated nervously: ""Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.""

""That won't help, Mr. Quail. I've sent for the expert and he will
probably have the safe open in a short time.""

""Blowtorches?"" the swearing man asked abruptly.

""Absurd. He would cook before he was out. And three feet of steel and
then two feet more.""

""Nitroglycerin?""

""And make jelly out of him?"" The woman tapped her finger-nails with her
glasses.

Another arrival, who carried a small satchel, talked with her in an
undertone and then took off his coat. He went first to a telephone on
the wall and said: ""Gi' me the inside of the vault. Hello.... Hello? You
there? Are you all right?... Try that combination again."" The
safe-expert held the wire and waited. Not even the faintest sounds of
the attempt were audible in the front room. ""Hello? You tried it?...
Well, see if those numbers are in this order."" He repeated a series of
complicated directions. Finally he hung up. ""Says it's getting pretty
stuffy in there. Says he's lying down on the floor.""

People came and went. The president himself walked in calmly and
occupied a chair. He lit a cigar, puffed on it, and stared with
ruminative eyes at the shiny mechanism on the front of the safe.

""We are doing everything possible,"" the woman said to him crisply.

""Of course,"" he nodded. ""I called up the insurance company. We're amply
covered."" A pause. ""Mrs. Robinson, post one of the guards to keep
people from running in and out of here. There are enough around
already.""

No one had given Hugo any attention. He stood quietly in the background.
The expert worked and all eyes were on him. Occasionally he muttered to
himself. The hands of an electric clock moved along in audible jerks.
Nearly an hour passed and the room had become hazy with tobacco smoke.
The man working on the safe was moist with perspiration. His blue shirt
was a darker blue around the armpits. He lit a cigarette, set it down,
whirled the dials again, lit another cigarette while the first one
burned a chair arm, and threw a crumpled, empty package on the floor.

At last he went to the phone again. He waited for some time before it
was answered, and he was compelled to make the man inside repeat
frequently. The new series of stratagems was without result. Before he
went again to his labours, he addressed the group. ""Air getting pretty
bad, I guess.""

""Is it dark?"" one of them asked tremulously.

""No.""

Fifteen minutes more. The expert glanced at the bank's president,
hesitated, struggled frenziedly for a while, and then sighed. ""I'm
afraid I can't get him out, sir. The combination is jammed and the
time-lock is all off.""

The president considered. ""Do you know of anyone else who could do
this?""

The man shook his head. ""No. I'm supposed to be the best. I've been
called out for this--maybe six times. I never missed before. You see, we
make this safe--or we used to make it. And I'm a specialist. It looks
serious.""

The president took his cigar from his mouth. ""Well, go ahead
anyway--until it's too late.""

Hugo stepped away from the wall. ""I think I can get him out.""

They turned toward him. The president looked at him coldly. ""And who are
you?""

Mrs. Robinson answered. ""He's the new man Mr. Shayne recommended so
highly.""

""Ah. And how do you propose to get him out, young man?""

Hugo stood pensively for a moment. ""By methods known only to me. I am
certain I can do it--but I will undertake it only if you will all leave
the room.""

""Ridiculous!"" Mrs. Robinson said.

The president's mouth worked. He looked more sharply at Hugo. Then he
rose. ""Come on, everybody."" He spoke quietly to Hugo. ""You have a nerve.
How much time do you want?""

""Five minutes.""

""Only five minutes,"" the president murmured as he walked from the
chamber.

Hugo did not move until they had all gone. Then he locked the door
behind them. He walked to the safe and rapped on it tentatively with his
knuckles. He removed his coat and vest. He planted his feet against the
steel sill under the door. He caught hold of the two handles, fidgeted
with his elbows, drew a deep breath, and pulled. There was a resonant,
metallic sound. Something gave. The edge of the seven-foot door moved
outward and a miasma steamed through the aperture. Hugo changed his
stance and took the door itself in his hands. His back bent. He pulled
again. With a reverberating clang and a falling of broken steel it swung
out. Hugo dragged the man who lay on the floor to a window that gave on
a grated pit. He broke the glass with his fist. The clerk's chest heaved
violently; he panted, opened his eyes, and closed them tremblingly.

Hugo put on his coat and vest and unlocked the door. The people outside
all moved toward him.

""It's all right,"" Hugo said. ""He's out.""

Mrs. Robinson glanced at the clerk and walked to the safe. ""He's ruined
it!"" she said in a shrill voice.

The president was behind her. He looked at the handles of the vault,
which had been bent like hair-pins, and he stooped to examine the
shattered bolts. Then his eyes travelled to Hugo. There was a profoundly
startled expression in them.

The clerk was sobbing. Presently he stopped. ""Who got me out?""

They indicated Hugo and he crossed the floor on tottering feet. ""Thanks,
mister,"" he said piteously. ""Oh, my God, what a wonderful thing to do!
I--I just passed out when I saw your fingers reaching around--""

""Never mind,"" Hugo interrupted. ""It's all right, buddy.""

The president touched his shoulder. ""Come up to my office."" A doctor
arrived. Several people left. Others stood around the demolished door.

The president was alone when Hugo entered and sat down. He was cold and
he eyed Hugo coldly. ""How did you do that?""

Hugo shrugged. ""That's my secret, Mr. Mills.""

""Pretty clever, I'd say.""

""Not when you know how."" Hugo was puzzled. His ancient reticence about
himself was acting together with a natural modesty.

""Some new explosive?""

""Not exactly.""

""Electricity? Magnetism? Thought-waves?""

Hugo chuckled. ""No. All wrong.""

""Could you do it on a modern safe?""

""I don't know.""

President Mills rubbed his fingers on the mahogany desk. ""I presume you
were planning that for other purposes?""

""What!"" Hugo said.

""Very well done. Very well acted. I will play up to you, Mr.--""

""Danner.""

""Danner. I'll play up to this assumption of innocence. You have saved a
man's life. You are, of course, blushingly modest. But you have shown
your hand rather clearly. Hmmm."" He smiled sardonically. ""I read a book
about a safe-cracker who opened a safe to get a child out--at the
expense of his liberty and position--or at the hazard of them, anyhow.
Maybe you have read the same book.""

""Maybe,"" Hugo answered icily.

""Safe-crackers--blasters, light fingers educated to the dials, and ears
attuned to the tumblers--we can cope with those things, Mr.--""

""Danner.""

""But this new stunt of yours. Well, until we find out what it is, we
can't let you go. This is business, Mr. Danner. It involves money,
millions, the security of American finance, of the very nation. You will
understand. Society cannot afford to permit a man like you to go at
large until it has a thoroughly effective defence against you. Society
must disregard your momentary sacrifice, momentary nobleness. Your
process, unknown by us, constitutes a great social danger. I do not dare
overlook it. I cannot disregard it even after the service you have
done--even if I thought you never intended to put it to malicious use.""

Hugo's thoughts were far away--to the fort he had built when he was a
child in Colorado, to the wagon he had lifted up, to the long,
discouraging gauntlet of hard hearts and frightened eyes that his
miracles had met with. His voice was wistful when, at last, he addressed
the banker.

""What do you propose to do?""

""I shan't bandy words, Danner. I propose to hang on to you until I get
that secret. And I shall be absolutely without mercy. That is frank, is
it not?""

""Quite.""

""You comprehend the significance of the third degree?""

""Not clearly.""

""You will learn about it--unless you are reasonable.""

Hugo bowed sadly. The president pressed a button. Two policemen came
into the room. ""McClaren has my instructions,"" he said.

""Come on."" Hugo rose and stood between them. He realized that the whole
pantomime of his arrest was in earnest. For one brief instant the
president was given a glimpse of a smile, a smile that worried him for a
long time. He was so worried that he called McClaren on the telephone
and added to his already abundant instructions.

A handful of bystanders collected to watch Hugo cross from the bank to
the steel patrol wagon. It moved forward and its bell sounded. The
policemen had searched Hugo and now they sat dumbly beside him. He was
handcuffed to both of them. Once he looked down at the nickel bonds and
up at the dull faces. His eyebrows lifted a fraction of an inch.

Captain McClaren received Hugo in a bare room shadowed by bars. He was a
thick-shouldered, red-haired man with a flabby mouth from which
protruded a moist and chewed toothpick. His eyes were blue and bland.
He made Hugo strip nude and gave him a suit of soiled clothes. Hugo
remained alone in that room for thirty hours without food or water. The
strain of that ordeal was greater than his jailers could have conceived,
but he bore it with absolute stoicism.

Early in the evening of the second day the lights in the room were put
out, a glaring automobile lamp was set up on a table, he was seated in
front of it, and men behind the table began to question him in voices
that strove to be terrible. They asked several questions and ultimately
boiled them down to one: ""How did you get that safe open?"" which was
bawled at him and whispered hoarsely at him from the darkness behind the
light until his mind rang with the words, until he was waiting
frantically for each new issue of the words, until sweat glistened on
his brow and he grew weak and nauseated. His head ached splittingly and
his heart pounded. They desisted at dawn, gave him a glass of water,
which he gulped, and a dose of castor oil, which he allowed them to
force into his mouth. A few hours later they began again. It was night
before they gave up.

The remnant of Hugo's clenched sanity was dumbfounded at what followed
after that. They beat his face with fists that shot from the blackness.
They threw him to the floor and kicked him. When his skin did not burst
and he did not bleed, they beat and kicked more viciously. They lashed
him with rubber hoses. They twisted his arms as far as they
could--until the bones of an ordinary man would have become dislocated.

Except for thirst and hunger and the discomfort caused by the castor
oil, Hugo did not suffer. They refined their torture slowly. They tried
to drive a splinter under his nails; they turned on the lights and drank
water copiously in his presence; they finally brought a blowtorch and
prepared to brand him. Hugo perceived that his invulnerability was to
stand him in stead no longer. His tongue was swollen, but he could still
talk. Sitting placidly in his bonds, he watched the soldering iron grow
white in the softly roaring flame. When, in the full light that shone on
the bare and hideous room, they took up the iron and approached him,
Hugo spoke.

""Wait. I'll tell you.""

McClaren put the iron back. ""You will, eh?""

""No.""

""Oh, you won't.""

""I shan't tell you, McClaren; I'll show you. And may God have mercy on
your filthy soul.""

There were six men in the room. Hugo looked from one to another. He
could tolerate nothing more; he had followed the course of President
Mills's social theory far enough to be surfeited with it. There was
decision in his attitude, and not one of the six men who had worked his
torment in relays could have failed to feel the chill of that decision.
They stood still. McClaren's voice rang out: ""Cover him, boys.""

Hugo stretched. His bonds burst; the chair on which he sat splintered to
kindling. Six revolvers spat simultaneously. Hugo felt the sting of the
bullets. Six chambers were emptied. The room eddied smoke. There was a
harsh silence.

""Now,"" Hugo said gently, ""I will demonstrate how I opened that safe.""

""Christ save us,"" one of the men whispered, crossing himself.

McClaren was frozen still. Hugo walked to the wall of the jail and
stabbed his fist through it. Brick and mortar burst out on the other
side and fell into the cinder yard. Hugo kicked and lashed with his
fists. A large hole opened. Then he turned to the men. They broke toward
the door, but he caught them one by one--and one by one he knocked them
unconscious. That much was for his own soul. Only McClaren was left. He
carried McClaren to the hole and dropped him into the yard. He wrenched
open the iron gate and walked out on the street, holding the policeman
by the arm. McClaren fainted twice and Hugo had to keep him upright by
clinging to his collar. It was dark. He hailed a cab and lifted the man
in.

""Just drive out of town,"" Hugo said.

McClaren came to. They bumped along for miles and he did not dare to
speak. The apartment buildings thinned. Street lights disappeared. They
traversed a stretch of woodland and then rumbled through a small town.

""Who are you?"" McClaren said.

""I'm just a man, McClaren--a man who is going to teach you a lesson.""

The taxi was on a smooth turnpike. It made swift time. Twice Hugo
satisfied the driver that the direction was all right. At last, on a
deserted stretch, Hugo called to the driver to stop. McClaren thought
that he was going to die. He did not plead. Hugo still held him by the
arm and helped him from the cab.

""Got any money on you?"" Hugo asked.

""About twenty dollars.""

""Give me five.""

With trembling fingers McClaren produced the bill. He put the remainder
of his money back in his pocket automatically. The taxi-driver was
watching, but Hugo ignored him.

""McClaren,"" he said soberly, ""here's your lesson. I just happen to be
the strongest man in the world. Never tell anybody that. And don't tell
anyone where I took you to-night--wherever it is. I shan't be here
anyway. If you tell either of those two things, I'll eat you. Actually.
There was a poor devil smothering in that safe and I yanked it open and
dragged him out. As a reward you and your dirty scavengers were put to
work on me. If I weren't as merciful as God Himself, you'd all be dead.
Now, that's your lesson. Keep your mouth shut. Here is the final
parable.""

Still holding the policeman's arm, he walked to the taxi and, to the
astonishment of the driver, gripped the axle in one hand, lifted up the
front end like a derrick, and turned the entire car around. He put
McClaren in the back seat.

""Don't forget, McClaren."" To the driver: ""Back to where you picked us
up. The bird in the back seat will be glad to pay.""

The red lamp of the cab vanished. Hugo turned in the other direction and
began to run in great leaps. He slowed when he came to a town. A light
was burning in an all-night restaurant. Hugo produced the five-dollar
bill.

""Give me a bucket of water--and put on about five steaks. Five.""




XIX


It was bright morning when Hugo awoke. Through the window-pane in the
room where he had slept, he could see a straggling back yard; damp
clothes moved in the breeze, and beyond was a depression green with
young shoots. He descended to the restaurant and ate his breakfast.
Automobiles were swishing along the road outside and he could hear a
clatter of dishes in the kitchen. Afterwards he went out doors and
walked through the busy centre of the village and on into the country.

Sun streamed upon him; the sky was blue; birds twittered in the budding
bushes. He had almost forgotten the beauty and peacefulness of
springtime; now it came over him with a rush--pastel colours and fecund
warmth, smells of earth and rain, melodious, haphazard wind. He knew
intuitively that McClaren would never send for him; he wondered what Mr.
Mills would say to Mr. Shayne about him. Both thoughts passed like white
clouds over his mind and he forgot them for an indolent vegetative
tranquillity.

The road curved over hills and descended into tinted valleys. Farmers
were ploughing and planting. The men at the restaurant had told him that
he was in Connecticut. That did not matter, for any other place would
have been the same on this May morning. A truck-driver offered him a
ride, which Hugo refused, and then, watching the cubic van surge away in
the distance, he wished fugitively that he had accepted.

Two half dollars and a quarter jingled in his pocket. His suit was seedy
and his beard unshaven. A picture of New York ran through his mind: he
stood far off from it gazing at the splendour of its towers in the
morning light; he came closer and the noise of it smote his ears;
suddenly he plunged into the city, his perspective vanished, and there
rose about him the ugly, unrelated, inchoate masses of tawdriness that
had been glorious from a distance, while people--dour, malicious,
selfish people who scuttled like ants--supplanted the vista of stone and
steel. The trite truth of the ratio between approach and enchantment
amused him. It was so obvious, yet so few mortals had the fine sense to
withdraw themselves. He was very happy walking tirelessly along that
road.

After his luncheon he allowed a truck to carry him farther from the
city, deeper into the magic of spring. The driver bubbled with it--he
wore a purple tulip in his greasy cap and he slowed down on the
hilltops with an unassuming reverence and a naïve slang that fitted well
with Hugo's mood. When he reached his destination, Hugo walked on with
reluctance. Shadows of the higher places moved into the lowlands. He
crossed a brook and leaned over its middle on the bridge rail,
fascinated by an underwater landscape, complete, full of colour, less
than a foot high. From every side came the strident music of frogs.
Spring, spring, spring, they sang, rolling their liquid gutturals and
stopping abruptly when he came too near.

In the evening, far from the city, he turned from the pavement on a
muddy country road, walking on until he reached the skeleton of an old
house. There he lay down, taking his supper from his pocket and eating
it slowly. The floor of the second story had fallen down and he could
see the stars through a hole in the roof. In such houses, he thought,
the first chapters of American history had been lived. When it was
entirely dark, a whippoorwill began to make its sweet and mournful
music. Warmth and chilliness came together from the ground. He slept.

In the morning he followed the road into the hills. Long stretches of
woodland were interrupted by fields. He passed farmhouses and the paved
drive of an estate. More than a mile from the deserted farm, more than
two miles from the main road, half hidden in a skirt of venerable trees,
he saw an old, green house behind which was a row of barns. It was a
big house; tile medallions had been set in its foundations by an
architect whose tombstone must now be aslant and illegible. It was built
on a variety of planes and angles; gables cropped at random from its
mossy roof. Grass grew in the broad yard under the trees, and in the
grass were crocuses, yellow and red and blue, like wind-strewn confetti.

Hugo paused to contemplate this peaceful edifice. A man walked briskly
from one of the barn doors. He perceived Hugo and stopped, holding a
spade in his hand. Then, after starting across to the house, he changed
his mind and, dropping the spade, approached Hugo.

""Looking for work, my man?""

Hugo smiled. ""Why--yes.""

""Know anything about cattle?""

""I was reared in a farming country.""

""Good."" He scrutinized Hugo minutely. ""I'll try you at eight dollars a
week, room, and board."" He opened the gate.

Hugo paused. The notion of finding employment somewhere in the country
had been fixed in his mind and he wondered why he waited, even as he
did, when the charm of the old manor had offered itself to him as if by
a miracle. The man swung open the gate; he was lithe, sober, direct.

""My name is Cane--Ralph Cane. We raise blooded Guernsey stock here. At
the moment we haven't a man.""

""I see,"" Hugo said.

""I could make the eight ten--in a week--if you were satisfactory.""

""I wasn't considering the money--""

""How?""

""I wasn't considering the money.""

""Oh! Come in. Try it."" An eagerness was apparent in his tone. While Hugo
still halted on a knoll of indecision, a woman opened the French windows
which lined one façade of the house and stepped down from the porch. She
was very tall and very slender. Her eyes were slaty blue and there was a
delicate suggestion--almost an apparition--of grey in her hair.

""What is it, Ralph?"" Her voice was cool and pitched low.

""This is my wife,"" Cane said.

""My name is Danner.""

Cane explained. ""I saw this man standing by the gate, and now I'm hiring
him.""

""I see,"" she said. She looked at Hugo. The crystalline substance of her
eyes glinted transiently with some inwardness--surprise, a vanishing
gladness, it might have been. ""You are looking for work?""

""Yes,"" Hugo answered.

Cane spoke hastily. ""I offered him eight a week and board, Roseanne.""

She glanced at her husband and returned her attention inquisitively to
Hugo. ""Are you interested?""

""I'll try it.""

Cane frowned nervously, walked to his wife, and nodded with averted
face. Then he addressed Hugo: ""You can sleep in the barn. We have
quarters there. I don't think we'll be in for any more cold weather. If
you'll come with me now, I'll start you right in.""

Until noon Hugo cleaned stables. There were two dozen cows--animals that
would have seemed beautiful to a rustic connoisseur--and one lordly bull
with malignant horns and bloodshot eyes. He shoveled the pungent and not
offensive débris into a wheelbarrow and transferred it to a dung-heap
that sweated with internal humidity. At noon Cane came into the barn.

""Pretty good,"" he said, viewing floors fairly shaved by Hugo's
diligence. ""Lunch is ready. You'll eat in the kitchen.""

Hugo saw the woman again. She was toiling over a stove, her hair in
disarray, a spotted apron covering her long body. He realized that they
had no servants, that the three of them constituted the human
inhabitants of the estate--but there were shades, innumerable shades, of
a long past, and some of those ghosts had crept into Roseanne's slaty
eyes. She carried lunch for herself and her husband into a front room
and left him to eat in the soft silence.

After lunch Cane spoke to him again. ""Can you plough?""

""It's been a long time--but I think so.""

""Good. I have a team. We'll drive to the north field. I've got to start
getting the corn in pretty soon.""

The room in the barn was bare: four board walls, a board ceiling and
floor, an iron cot, blankets, the sound and smell of the cows beneath.
Hugo slept dreamlessly, and when he woke, he was ravenous.

His week passed. Cane drove him like a slave-master, but to drive Hugo
was an unhazardous thing. He did not think much, and when he did, it was
to read the innuendo of living that was written parallel to the
existence of his employer and Roseanne. They were troubled with each
other. Part of that trouble sprang from an evident source: Cane was a
miser. He resented the amount of food that Hugo consumed, despite the
unequal ratio of Hugo's labours. When Hugo asked for a few dollars in
advance, he was curtly refused. That had happened at lunch one day.
After lunch, however, and evidently after Cane had debated with his
wife, he inquired of Hugo what he wanted. A razor and some shaving
things and new trousers, Hugo had said.

Cane drove the station wagon to town and returned with the desired
articles. He gave them to Hugo.

""Thank you,"" Hugo said.

Cane chuckled, opening his thin lips wide. ""All right, Danner. As a
matter of fact, it's money in my bank.""

""Money in your bank?""

""Sure. I've lived here for years and I get a ten-per-cent discount at
the general store. But I'm charging you full price--naturally.""

""Naturally,"" Hugo agreed.

That was one thing that would make the tribulation in her eyes. Hugo
wished that he could have met these two people on a different basis, so
that he could have learned the truth about them. It was plain that they
were educated, cultured, refined. Cane had said something once about
raising cattle in England, and Roseanne had cooked peas as she had
learned to cook them in France. ""_Petits pois au beurre_,"" she had
murmured--with an unimpeachable accent.

Then the week had passed and there had been no mention of the advance in
wages. For himself, Hugo did not care. But it was easy to see why no one
had been working on the place when Hugo arrived, why they were eager to
hire a transient stranger.

He learned part of what he had already guessed from a clerk in the
general store. One of the cows was ailing. Mr. Cane could not drive to
town (Mrs. Cane, it seemed, never left the house and its environs) and
they had sent Hugo.

""You working for the Canes?"" the clerk had asked.

""Yes.""

""Funny people.""

Hugo replied indirectly. ""Have they lived here long?""

""Long? Roseanne Cane was a Bishop. The Bishops built that house and the
house before it--back in the seventeen hundreds. They had a lot of
money. Have it still, I guess, but Cane's too tight to spend it."" There
was nothing furtive in the youth's manner; he was evidently touching on
common village gossip. ""Yes, sir, too tight. Won't give her a maid. But
before her folks died, it was Europe every year and a maid for every one
of 'em, and 'Why, deary, don't tell me that's the second time you've put
on that dress! Take it right off and never wear it again.'"" The joke was
part of the formula for telling about the Canes, and the clerk snickered
appreciatively. ""Yes, sir. You come down here some day when I ain't got
the Friday orders to fill an' I'll tell you some things about old man
Cane that'll turn your stummick.""

Hugo accepted his bundle, set it in the seat beside himself, and drove
back to the big, green house.

Later in the day he said to Cane: ""If you will want me to drive the
station wagon very often, I ought to have a license.""

""Go ahead. Get one.""

""I couldn't afford it at the moment, and since it would be entirely for
you, I thought--""

""I see,"" Cane answered calmly. ""Trying to get a license out of me. Well,
you're out of luck. You probably won't be needed as a chauffeur again
for the next year. If you are, you'll drive without a license, and drive
damn carefully, too, because any fines or any accidents would come out
of your wages.""

Hugo received the insult unmoved. He wondered what Cane would say if he
smashed the car and made an escape. He knew he would not do it; the
whole universe appeared so constructed that men like Cane inevitably
avoided their desserts.

June came, and July. The sea-shore was not distant and occasionally at
night Hugo slipped away from the woods and lay on the sand, sometimes
drinking in the firmament, sometimes closing his eyes. When it was very
hot he undressed behind a pile of barnacle-covered boulders and swam far
out in the water. He swam naked, unmolested, stirring up tiny whirlpools
of phosphorescence, and afterwards, damp and cool, he would dress and
steal back to the barn through the forest and the hay-sweet fields.

One day a man in Middletown asked Mr. Cane to call on him regarding the
possible purchase of three cows. Cane's cows were raised with the
maximum of human care, the minimum of extraneous expense. His profit on
them was great and he sold them, ordinarily, one at a time. He was so
excited at the prospect of a triple sale that for a day he was almost
gay, very nearly generous. He drove off blithely--not in the sedan, but
in the station wagon, because its gasoline mileage was greater.

It was a day filled with wonder for Hugo. When Cane drove from the
house, Roseanne was standing beside the drive. She walked over to the
barn and said to Hugo in an oddly agitated voice: ""Mr. Danner, could you
spare an hour or two this morning to help me get some flowers from the
woods?""

""Certainly.""

She glanced in the direction her husband had taken and hurried to the
kitchen, returning presently with two baskets and a trowel. He followed
her up the road. They turned off on an overgrown path, pushed through
underbrush, and arrived in a few minutes at the side of a pond. The
edges were grown thick with bushes and water weeds, dead trees lifted
awkward arms at the upper end, and dragon flies skimmed over the warm
brown water.

""I used to come here to play when I was a little girl,"" she said. ""It's
still just the same."" She wore a blue dress; branches had dishevelled
her hair; she seemed more alive than he had ever seen her.

""It's charming,"" Hugo answered.

""There used to be a path all the way around--with stones crossing the
brook at the inlet. And over there, underneath those pine trees, there
are some orchids. I've always wanted to bring them down to the house. I
think I could make them grow. Of course, this is a bad time to
transplant anything--but I so seldom get a chance. I can't remember
when--when--""

He realized with a shock that she was going to cry. She turned her head
away and peered into the green wall. ""I think it's here,"" she said
tremulously.

They followed a dimly discernible trail; there were deer tracks in it
and signs of other animals whose feet had kept it passable. It was hot
and damp and they were forced to bend low beneath the tangle to make
progress. Almost suddenly they emerged in a grove of white pines. They
stood upright and looked: wind stirred sibilantly in the high tops, and
the ground underfoot was a soft carpet; the lake reflected the blue of
the sky instead of the brown of its soft bottom.

""Let's rest a minute,"" she said. And then: ""I always think a pine grove
is like a cathedral. I read somewhere that pines inspired Gothic
architecture. Do you suppose it's true?""

""There was the lotos and the Corinthian column,"" Hugo answered.

They sat down. This was a new emotion--a paradoxical emotion for him. He
had come to an inharmonious sanctuary and he could expect both tragedy
and enchantment. There was Roseanne herself, a hidden beautiful thing in
whom were prisoned many beauties. She was growing old in the frosty
seclusion of her husband's company. She was feeding on the toothless
food of dreams when her hunger was still strong. That much anyone might
see; the reason alone remained invisible. He was acutely conscious of an
hour at hand, an imminent moment of vision.

""You're a strange man,"" she said finally.

That was to be the password. ""Yes?""

""I've watched you every day from the kitchen window."" Her depression
had gone now and she was talking with a vague excitement.

""Have you?""

""Do you mind if we pretend for a minute?""

""I'd like it.""

""Then let's pretend this is a magic carpet and we've flown away from the
world and there's nothing to do but play. Play,"" she repeated musingly.
""I'll be Roseanne and you'll be Hugo. You see, I found out your name
from the letters. I found out a lot about you. Not facts like born,
occupation, father's first name; just--things.""

He dared a little then. ""What sort of things, Roseanne?""

She laughed. ""I knew you could do it! That's one of them. I found out
you had a soul. Souls show even in barn-yards. You looked at the peonies
one day and you played with the puppies the next. In one
way--Hugo--you're a failure as a farm hand.""

""Failure?""

""A flop. You never make a grammatical mistake."" She saw his surprise and
laughed again. ""And your manners--and, then, you understood French.
See--the carpet is taking us higher and farther away. Isn't it fun!
You're the hired man and I'm the farmer's wife and all of a
sudden--we're--""

""A prince and princess?""

""That's exactly right. I won't pretend I'm not curious--morbidly
curious. But I won't ask questions, either, because that isn't what the
carpet is for.""

""What is it for, Roseanne?""

""To get away from the world, silly. And now--there's a look about you.
When I was a little girl, my father was a great man, and many great men
used to come to our house. I know what the frown of power is and the
attitude of greatness. You have them--much more than any pompous old
magnate I ever laid eyes on. The way you touch things and handle them,
the way you square your shoulders. Sometimes I think you're not real at
all and just an imaginary knight come to storm my castle. And sometimes
I think you're a very famous man whose afternoon walk just has been
extended for a few months. The first thought frightens me, and the
second makes me wonder why I haven't seen your picture in the Sunday
rotogravures.""

Hugo's shoulders shook. ""Poor Princess Roseanne. And what do I think
about you, then--""

She held up her hand. ""Don't tell me, Hugo. I should be sad. After all,
my life--""

""May be what it does not appear to be.""

She took a brittle pine twig and dug in the mould of the needles until
it broke. ""Ralph--was different once. He was a chemist. Then--the war
came. And he was there and a shell--""

""Ah,"" Hugo said. ""And you loved him before?""

""I had promised him before. But it changed him so. And it's hard.""

""The carpet,"" he answered gently. ""The carpet--""

""I almost dropped off, and then I'd have been hurt, wouldn't I?""

""A favour for a favour. I'm not a great man, but I hope to be one. I
have something that I think is a talent. Let it go at that. The letters
come from my father and mother--in Colorado.""

""I've never seen Colorado.""

""It's big--""

""Like the nursery of the Titans, I think,"" she said softly, and Hugo
shuddered. The instinct had been too true.

Her eyes were suddenly stormy. ""I feel old enough to mother you, Hugo.
And yet, since you came, I've been a little bit in love with you. It
doesn't matter, does it?""

""I think--I know--""

""Sit closer to me then, Hugo.""

The sun had passed the zenith before they spoke connectedly again. ""Time
for the magic carpet to come to earth,"" she said gaily.

""Is it?""

""Don't be masculine any longer--and don't be rudely possessive. Of
course it is. Aren't you hungry?""

""I was hungry--"" he began moodily.

""All off at earth. Come on. Button me. Am I a sight?""

""I disregard the bait.""

""You're being funny. Come. No--wait. We've forgotten the orchids. I
wonder if I really came for orchids. Should you be terribly offended if
I said I thought I did?""

""Extravagantly offended.""

Cane returned late in the day. The cows had been sold--""I even made five
hundred clear and above the feeding and labour on the one with the off
leg. She'll breed good cattle."" The barns were as clean as a park, and
Roseanne was singing as she prepared dinner.

Nothing happened until a hot night in August. The leaves were still and
limp, the moon had set. Hugo lay awake and he heard her coming quietly
up the stairs.

""Ralph had a headache and he took two triple bromides. Of course, I
could always have said that I heard one of the cows in distress and came
to wake you. But he's jealous, poor dear. And then--but who could resist
a couple of simultaneous alibis?""

""Nobody,"" he whispered. She sat down on his bed. He put his arm around
her and felt that she was in a nightdress. ""I wish I could see you now.""

""Then take this flashlight--just for an instant. Wait."" He heard the
rustle of her clothing. ""Now.""

She heard him draw in his breath. Then the light went out.

       *       *       *       *       *

With the approach of autumn weather Roseanne caught a cold. She
continued her myriad tasks, but he could see that she was miserable.
Even Cane sympathized with her gruffly. When the week of the cattle show
in New York arrived, the cold was worse and she begged off the long trip
on the trucks with the animals. He departed alone with his two most
precious cows, scarcely thinking of her, muttering about judges and
prizes.

Again she came out to the barn. ""You've made me a dreadful hypocrite.""

""I know it.""

""You were waiting for me! Men are so disgustingly sure of everything!""

""But--""

""I've made myself cough and sniffle until I can't stop.""

Hugo smiled broadly. ""All aboard the carpet....""

They lay in a field that was surrounded by trees. The high weeds hid
them. Goldenrod hung over them. ""Life can't go on--""

""Like this,"" he finished for her.

""Well--can it?""

""It's up to you, Roseanne. I never knew there were women--""

""Like me? You should have said 'was a woman.'""

""Would you run away with me?""

""Never.""

""Aren't we just hunting for an emotion?""

""Perhaps. Because there was a day--one day--in the pines--""

He nodded. ""Different from these other two. That's because of the tragic
formation of life. There is only one first, only one commencement, only
one virginity. Then--""

""Character sets in.""

""Then it becomes living. It may remain beautiful, but it cannot remain
original.""

""You'd be hard to live with.""

""Why, Roseanne?""

""Because you're so determined not to have an illusion.""

""And you--""

""Go on. Say it. I'm so determined to have one.""

""Are we quarreling? I can fix that. Come closer, Roseanne."" Her face
changed through delicate shades of feeling to tenderness and to
intensity. Abruptly Hugo leaped to his feet.

The rhythmic thunder rode down upon them like the wind. A few yards
away, head down, tail straight, the big bull charged over the ground
like an avalanche. Roseanne lifted herself in time to see Hugo take two
quick steps, draw back his fist, and hit the bull between the horns. It
was a diabolical thing. The bull was thrown back upon itself. Its neck
snapped loudly. Its feet crumpled; it dropped dead. Twenty feet to one
side was a stone wall. Hugo picked up a hoof and dragged the carcass to
the base of the wall. With his hand he made an indenture in the rocks,
and over the face of the hollow he splashed the bull's blood. Then he
approached Roseanne. The whole episode had occupied less than a minute.

She had hunched her shoulders together, and her face was pale. She
articulated with difficulty. ""The bull""--her hands twitched--""broke in
here--and you hit him.""

""Just in time, Roseanne.""

""You killed him. Then--why did you drag him over there?""

""Because,"" Hugo answered slowly, ""I thought it would be better to make
it seem as if he charged the wall and broke his neck that way.""

Her frigidity was worse than any hysteria. ""It isn't natural to be able
to do things like that. It isn't human.""

He swallowed; those words in that stifled intonation were very familiar.
""I know it. I'm very strong.""

Roseanne looked down at the grass. ""Wipe your hand, will you?""

He rubbed it in the earth. ""You mustn't be frightened.""

""No?"" She laughed a little. ""What must I be, then? I'm alive, I'm
crawling with terror. Don't touch me!"" She screamed and drew back.

""I can explain it.""

""You can explain everything! But not that.""

""It was an idiotic, wild, unfair thing to have happen at this time,"" he
said. ""My life's like that."" He looked beyond her. ""I began wanting to
do tremendous things. The more I tried, the more discouraged I became.
You see, I was strong. There have been other things figuratively like
the bull. But the things themselves get littler and more preposterous,
because my ambition and my nerve grows smaller."" He lowered his head.
""Some day--I shan't want to do anything at all any more. Continuous and
unwonted defeat might infuriate some men to a great effort. It's tiring
me."" He raised his eyes sadly to hers. ""Roseanne--!""

She gathered her legs under herself and ran. Hugo made no attempt to
follow her. He merely watched. Twice she tripped and once she fell. At
the stone wall she looked back at him. It was not necessary to be able
to see her expression. She went on across the fields--a skinny, flapping
thing--at last a mere spot of moving colour.

Hugo turned and stared at the brown mound of the bull. After a moment he
walked over and stood above it. Its tongue hung out and its mouth
grinned. It lay there dead, and yet to Hugo it still had life: the
indestructibility of a ghost and the immortality of a symbol. He sat
beside it until sundown.

At twilight he entered the barn and tended the cows. The doors of the
house were closed. He went without supper. Cane returned jubilantly
later in the evening. He called Hugo from the back porch.

""Telegram for you.""

Hugo read the wire. His father was sick and failing rapidly. ""I want my
wages,"" he said. Then he went back to the barn. His trifling belongings
were already wrapped in a bundle. Cane reluctantly counted out the
money. Hugo felt nauseated and feverish. He put the money in his pocket,
the bundle under his arm; he opened the gate, and his feet found the
soft earth of the road in the darkness.




XX


Hugo had three hours to wait for a Chicago train. His wages purchased
his ticket and left him in possession of twenty dollars. His clothing
was nondescript; he had no baggage. He did not go outside the Grand
Central Terminal, but sat patiently in the smoking-room, waiting for the
time to pass. A guard came up to him and asked to see his ticket. Hugo
did not remonstrate and produced it mechanically; he would undoubtedly
be mistaken for a tramp amid the sleek travellers and commuters.

When the train started, his fit of perplexed lethargy had not abated.
His hands and feet were cold and his heart beat slowly. Life had
accustomed him to frustration and to disappointment, yet it was
agonizing to assimilate this new cudgeling at the hands of fate. The old
green house in the Connecticut hills had been a refuge; Roseanne had
been a refuge. They were, both of them, peaceful and whimsical and they
had seemed innocent of the capacity for great anguish. Every man dreams
of the season-changed countryside as an escape; every man dreams of a
woman on whose broad breast he may rest, beneath whose tumbling hair and
moth-like hands he may discover forgetfulness and freedom. Some men are
successful in a quest for those anodynes. Hugo could understand the
sharp contours of one fact: because he was himself, such a quest would
always end in failure. No woman lived who could assuage him; his fires
would not yield to any temporal powers.

He was barren of desire to investigate deeper into the philosophy of
himself. All people turned aside by fate fall into the same morass.
Except in his strength, Hugo was pitifully like all people: wounds could
easily be opened in his sensitiveness; his moral courage could be taxed
to the fringe of dilemma; he looked upon his fellow men sometimes with
awe at the variety of high places they attained in spite of the heavy
handicap of being human--he looked upon them again with repugnance--and
very rarely, as he grew older, did such inspections of his kind include
a study of the difference between them and him made by his singular
gift. When that thought entered his mind, it gave rise to peculiar
speculations.

He approached thirty, he thought, and still the world had not re-echoed
with his name; the trumps, banners, and cavalcade of his glory had been
only shadows in the sky, dust at sunset that made evanescent and
intangible colours. Again, he thought, the very perfection of his
prowess was responsible for its inapplicability; if he but had an
Achilles' heel so that his might could taste the occasional tonic of
inadequacy, then he could meet the challenge of possible failure with
successful effort. More frequently he condemned his mind and spirit for
not being great enough to conceive a mission for his thews. Then he
would fall into a reverie, trying to invent a creation that would be as
magnificent as the destructions he could so easily envision.

In such a painful and painstaking mood he was carried over the
Alleghenies and out on the Western plains. He changed trains at Chicago
without having slept, and all he could remember of the journey was a
protracted sorrow, a stabbing consciousness of Roseanne, dulled by his
last picture of her, and a hopeless guessing of what she thought about
him now.

Hugo's mother met him at the station. She was unaltered, everything was
unaltered. The last few instants in the vestibule of the train had been
a series of quick remembrances; the whole countryside was like a
long-deserted house to which he had returned. The mountains took on a
familiar aspect, then the houses, then the dingy red station. Lastly his
mother, upright and uncompromisingly grim, dressed in her perpetual
mourning of black silk. Her recognition of Hugo produced only the
slightest flurry and immediately she became mundane.

""Whatever made you come in those clothes?""

""I was working outdoors, mother. I got right on a train. How is father?""

""Sinking slowly.""

""I'm glad I'm in time.""

""It's God's will."" She gazed at him. ""You've changed a little, son.""

""I'm older."" He felt diffident. A vast gulf had risen between this
vigorous, religious woman and himself.

She opened a new topic. ""Whatever in the world made you send us all that
money?""

Hugo smiled. ""Why--I didn't need it, mother. And I thought it would make
you and father happy.""

""Perhaps. Perhaps. It has done some good. I've sent four missionaries
out in the field and I am thinking of sending two more. I had a new
addition put on the church, for the drunkards and the fallen. And we put
a bathroom in the house. Your father wanted two, but I wouldn't hear of
it.""

""Have you got a car?""

""Car? I couldn't use one of those inventions of Satan. Your father made
me hire this one to meet you. There's Anna Blake's house. She married
that fellow she was flirting with when you went away. And there's our
house. It was painted last month.""

Now all the years had dropped away and Hugo was a child again, an
adolescent again. The car stopped.

""You can go right up. He's in the front room. I'll get lunch.""

Hugo's father was lying on the bed watching the door. A little wizened
old man with a big head and thin yellow hands. Illness had made his eyes
rheumy, but they lighted up when his son entered, and he half raised
himself.

""Hello, father.""

""Hugo! You've come back.""

""Yes, father.""

""I've waited for you. Sit down here on the bed. Move me over a little.
Now close the door. Is it cold out? I was afraid you might not get here.
I was afraid you might get sick on the train. Old people are like that,
Hugo."" He shaded his eyes. ""You aren't a very big man, son. Somehow I
always remembered you as big. But--I suppose""--his voice thinned--""I
suppose you don't want to talk about yourself.""

""Anything you want to hear, father.""

""I can't believe you came back."" He ruminated. ""There were a thousand
things I wanted to ask you, son--but they've all gone from my mind. I'm
not so easy in your presence as I was when you were a little shaver.""

Hugo knew what those questions would be. Here, on his death-bed, his
father was still a scientist. His soul flinched from giving its account.
He saw suddenly that he could never tell his father the truth; pity,
kindredship, kindness, moved him. ""I know what you wanted to ask,
father. Am I still strong?"" It took courage to suggest that. But he was
rewarded. The old man sighed ecstatically. ""That's it, Hugo, my son.""

""Then--father, I am. I grew constantly stronger when I left you. In
college I was strong. At sea I was strong. In the war. First I wanted to
be mighty in games and I was. Then I wanted to do services. And I did,
because I could.""

The head nodded on its feeble neck. ""You found things to do? I--I hoped
you would. But I always worried about you. Every day, son, every day for
all these years, I picked up the papers and looked at them with
misgivings. 'Suppose,' I said to myself, 'suppose my boy lost his temper
last night. Suppose someone wronged him and he undertook to avenge
himself.' I trusted you, Hugo. I could not quite trust--the other thing.
I've even blamed myself and hated myself."" He smiled. ""But it's all
right--all right. So I am glad. Then, tell me--what--what--""

""What have I done?""

""Do you mind? It's been so long and you were so far away.""

""Well--"" Hugo swept his memory back over his career--""so many things,
father. It's hard to recite one's own--""

""I know. But I'm your father, and my ears ache to hear.""

""I saved a man pinned under a wagon. I saved a man from a shark. I
pulled open a safe in which a man was smothering. Many things like that.
Then--there was the war.""

""I know. I know. When you wrote that you had gone to war, I was
frightened--and happy. Try as I might, I could not think of a great
constructive cause for you to enter. I had to satisfy myself by thinking
that you could find such a cause. Then the war came. And you wrote that
you were in it. I was happy. I am old, Hugo, and perhaps my nationalism
and my patriotism are dead. Sides in a war did not seem to matter. But
peace mattered to me, and I thought--I hoped that you could hasten
peace. Four years, Hugo. Your letters said nothing. Four years. And then
it stopped. And I understood. War is property fighting property, not
David fighting Goliath. The greatest David would be unavailing now. Even
you could do little enough.""

""Perhaps not so little, father.""

""There were things, then?""

Hugo could not disappoint his father with the whole formidable truth.
""Yes."" He lied with a steady gaze. ""I stopped the war.""

""You!""

""After four years I perceived the truth of what you have just said. War
is a mistake. It is not sides that matter. The object of war is to make
peace. On a dark night, father, I went alone into the enemy lines. For
one hundred miles that night I upset every gun, I wrecked every
ammunition train, I blew up every dump--every arsenal, that is. Alone I
did it. The next day they asked for peace. Remember the false armistice?
Somehow it leaked out that there would be victory and surrender the
next night--because of me. Only the truth about me was never known. And
a day later--it came.""

The weak old man was transported. He raised himself up on his elbows.
""You did that! Then all my work was not in vain. My dream and my prayer
were justified! Oh, Hugo, you can never know how glad I am you came and
told me this. How glad.""

He repeated his expression of joy until his tongue was weary; then he
fell back. Hugo sat with shining eyes during the silence that followed.
His father at length groped for a glass of water. Strength returned to
him. ""I could ask for no more, son. And yet we are petulant, insatiable
creatures. What is doing now? The world is wicked. Yet it tries
half-heartedly to rebuild itself. One great deed is not enough--or are
you tired?""

Hugo smiled. ""Am I ever tired, father? Am I vulnerable?""

""I had forgotten. It is so hard for the finite mind to think beyond
itself. Not tired. Not vulnerable. No. There was Samson--the cat."" He
was embarrassed. ""I hurt you?""

""No, father."" He repeated it. Every gentle fall of the word ""father""
from his lips and every mention of ""son"" by his father was rare
privilege, unfamiliar elixir to the old man. His new lie took its cue
from Abednego Danner's expressions. ""My work goes on. Now it is with
America. I expect to go to Washington soon to right the wrongs of
politics and government. Vicious and selfish men I shall force from
their high places. I shall secure the idealistic and the courageous."" It
was a theory he had never considered, a possible practice born of
necessity. ""The pressure I shall bring against them will be physical and
mental. Here a man will be driven from his house mysteriously. There a
man will slip into the limbo. Yonder an inconspicuous person will
suddenly be braced by a new courage; his enemies will be gone and his
work will progress unhampered. I shall be an invisible agent of
right--right as best I can see it. You understand, father?""

Abednego smiled like a happy child. ""I do, son. To be you must be
splendid.""

""The most splendid thing on earth! And I have you to thank, you and your
genius to tender gratitude to. I am merely the agent. It is you that
created and the whole world that benefits.""

Abednego's face was serene--not smug, but transfigured. ""I yearned as
you now perform. It is strange that one cloistered mortal can become
inspired with the toil and lament of the universe. Yet there is a danger
of false pride in that, too. I am apt to fall into the pit because my
cup is so full here at the last. And the greatest problem of all is not
settled.""

""What problem?"" Hugo asked in surprise.

""Why, the problem that up until now has been with me day and night.
Shall there be made more men like you--and women like you?""

The idea staggered Hugo. It paralyzed him and he heard his father's
voice come from a great distance. ""Up in the attic in the black trunk
are six notebooks wrapped in oilpaper. They were written in pencil, but
I went over them carefully in ink. That is my life-work, Hugo. It is the
secret--of you. Given those books, a good laboratory worker could go
through all my experiments and repeat each with the same success. I
tried a little myself. I found out things--for example, the effect of
the process is not inherited by the future generations. It must be done
over each time. It has seemed to me that those six little books--you
could slip them all into your coat pocket--are a terrible explosive.
They can rip the world apart and wipe humanity from it. In malicious
hands they would end life. Sometimes, when I became nervous waiting for
the newspapers, waiting for a letter from you, I have been sorely
tempted to destroy them. But now--""

""Now?"" Hugo echoed huskily.

""Now I understand. There is no better keeping for them than your own. I
give them to you.""

""Me!""

""You, son. You must take them, and the burden must be yours. You have
grown to manhood now and I am proud of you. More than proud. If I were
not, I myself would destroy the books here on this bed. Matilda would
bring them and I would watch them burn so that the danger would go
with--"" he cleared his throat--""my dream.""

""But--""

""You cannot deny me. It is my wish. You can see what it means. A world
grown suddenly--as you are.""

""I, father--""

""You have not avoided responsibility. You will not avoid this, the
greatest of your responsibilities. Since the days when I made those
notes--what days!--biology has made great strides. For a time I was
anxious. For a time I thought that my research might be rediscovered.
But it cannot be. Theory has swung in a different direction."" He smiled
with inner amusement. ""The opticians have decided that the microscope I
made is impossible. The biochemists, moving through the secretions of
such things as hippuric acid in the epithelial cells, to enzymes, to
hormones, to chromosomes, have put a false construction on everything.
It will take hundreds, thousands of years to see the light. The darkness
is so intense and the error so plausible that they may never see again
exactly as I saw. The fact of you, at best, may remain always no more
than a theory. This is not vanity. My findings were a combination of
accidents almost outside the bounds of mathematical probability. It is
you who must bear the light.""

Hugo felt that now, indeed, circumstance had closed around him and left
him without succour or recourse. He bowed his head. ""I will do it,
father.""

""Now I can die in peace--in joy.""

With an almost visible wrench Hugo brought himself back to his
surroundings. ""Nonsense, father. You'll probably get well.""

""No, son. I've studied the progress of this disease in the lower
orders--when I saw it imminent. I shall die--not in pain, but in sleep.
But I shall not be dead--because of you."" He held out his hand for Hugo.

Some time later the old professor fell asleep and Hugo tiptoed from the
room. Food was sizzling downstairs in the kitchen, but he ignored it,
going out into the sharp air by the front door. He hastened along the
streets and soon came to the road that led up the mountain. He climbed
rapidly, and when he dared, he discarded the tedious little steps of all
mankind. He reached the side of the quarry where he had built the stone
fort, and seated himself on a ledge that hung over it. Trees, creepers,
and underbrush had grown over the place, but through the
October-stripped barricade of their branches he could see a heap of
stones that was his dolmen, on which the hieroglyph of him was
inscribed.

Two tears scalded his cheeks; he trembled with the welter of his
emotions. He had failed his father, failed his trust, failed the world;
and in the abyss of that grief he could catch no sight of promise or
hope. Having done his best, he had still done nothing, and it was
necessary for him to lie to put the thoughts of a dying man to rest. The
pity of that lie! The folly of the picture he had painted of
himself--Hugo Danner the scourge of God, Hugo Danner the destroying
angel, Hugo Danner the hero of a quick love-affair that turned brown
and dead like a plucked flower, the sentimental soldier, the involuntary
misanthrope.

""I must do it!"" he whispered fiercely. The ruined stones echoed the
sound of his voice with a remote demoniac jeer. Do what? What, strong
man? What?




XXI


Now the winds keened from the mountains, and snow fell. Abednego Danner,
the magnificent Abednego Danner, was carried to his last resting-place,
the laboratory of nature herself. His wife and his son followed the
bier; the dirge was intoned, the meaningless cadence of ritual was
spoken to the cold ground; a ghostly obelisk was lifted up over his
meagre remains. Hugo had a wish to go to the hills and roll down some
gigantic chunk of living rock to mark that place until the coming of a
glacier, but he forbore and followed all the dark conventions of
disintegration.

The will was read and the bulk of Hugo's sorry gains was thrust back
into his keeping. He went into the attic and opened the black trunk
where the six small notebooks lay in oilpaper. He took them out and
unwrapped them. The first two books were a maze of numbered experiments.
In the third a more vigorous calligraphy, a quivering tracery of
excitement, marked the repressed beginning of a new earth.

He bought a bag and some clothes and packed; the false contralto of his
mother's hymns as she went about the house filled him with such despair
that he left after the minimum interval allowed by filial decency. She
was a grim old woman still, one to whom the coming of the kingdom to
Africa was a passion, the polishing of the coal stove a duty, and the
presence of her unfamiliar son a burden.

When he said good-by, he kissed her, which left her standing on the
station platform looking at the train with a flat, uncomprehending
expression. Hugo knew where he was going and why: he was on his way to
Washington. The great crusade was to begin. He had no plans, only
ideals, which are plans of a sort. He had told his father he was making
the world a better place, and the idea had taken hold of him. He would
grapple the world, his world, at its source; he would no longer attempt
to rise from a lowly place; he would exert his power in the highest
places; government, politics, law, were malleable to the force of one
man.

Most of his illusion was gone. As he had said so glibly to his father,
there were good men and corrupt in the important situations in the
world; to the good he would lend his strength, to the corrupt he would
exhibit his embattled antipathy. He would be not one impotent person
seeking to dominate, but the agent of uplift. He would be what he
perceived life had meant him to be: an instrument. He could not be a
leader, but he could create a leader.

Such was his intention; he had seen a new way to reform the world, and
if his inspiration was clouded occasionally with doubt, he disavowed the
doubts as a Christian disavows temptation. This was to be his
magnificent gesture; he closed his eyes to the inferences made by his
past.

He never thought of himself as pathetic or quixotic; his ability to
measure up to external requirements was infinite; his disappointment lay
always (he thought) in his spirit and his intelligence. He went to
Washington: the world was pivoting there.

His first few weeks were dull. He installed himself in a pleasant house
and hired two servants. The use to which he was putting his funds
compensated for their origin. It was men like Shayne who would suffer
from his mission. And such a man came into view before very long.

Hugo interested himself in politics and the appearance of politics. He
read the _Congressional Record_, he talked with everyone he met, he went
daily to the Capitol and listened to the amazing pattern of harangue
from the lips of innumerable statesmen. In looking for a cause his eye
fell naturally on the problem of disarmament. Hugo saw at once that it
was a great cause and that it was bogged in the greed of individuals. It
is not difficult to become politically partisan in the Capitol of any
nation. It was patent to Hugo that disarmament meant a removal of the
chance for war; Hugo hated war. He moved hither and thither, making
friends, learning, entertaining, never exposing his plan--which his new
friends thought to be lobbying for some impending legislation.

He picked out an individual readily enough. Some of the men he had come
to know were in the Senate, others in the House of Representatives,
others were diplomats, newspaper reporters, attachés. Each alliance had
been cemented with care and purpose. His knowledge of an enemy came by
whisperings, by hints, by plain statements.

Congressman Hatten, who argued so eloquently for laying down arms and
picking up the cause of humanity, was a guest of Hugo's.

""Danner,"" he said, after a third highball, ""you're a sensible chap. But
you don't quite get us. I'm fighting for disarmament--""

""And making a grand fight--""

The Congressman waved his hand. ""Sure. That's what I mean. You really
want this thing for itself. But, between you and me, I don't give a rap
about ships and guns. My district is a farm district. We aren't
interested in paying millions in taxes to the bosses and owners in a
coal and iron community. So I'm against it. Dead against it--with my
constituency behind me. Nobody really wants to spend the money except
the shipbuilders and steel men. Maybe they don't, theoretically. But
the money in it is too big. That's why I fight.""

""And your speeches?""

""Pap, Danner, pure pap. Even the yokels in my home towns realize that.""

""It doesn't seem like pap to me.""

""That's politics. In a way it isn't. Two boys I was fond of are lying
over there in France. I don't want to make any more shells. But I have
to think of something else first. If I came from some other district,
the case would be reversed. I'd like to change the tariff. But the
industrials oppose me in that. So we compromise. Or we don't. I think I
could put across a decent arms-limitation bill right now, for example,
if I could get Willard Melcher out of town for a month.""

""Melcher?""

""You know him, of course--at least, who he is. He spends the steel money
here in Washington--to keep the building program going on. Simple thing
to do. The Navy helps him. Tell the public about the Japanese menace,
the English menace, all the other menaces, and the public coughs up for
bigger guns and better ships. Run 'em till they rust and nobody ever
really knows what good they could do.""

""And Melcher does that?""

The Congressman chuckled. ""His pay-roll would make your eyes bulge. But
you can't touch him.""

Hugo nodded thoughtfully. ""Don't you think anyone around here works
purely for an idea?""

""How's that? Oh--I understand. Sure. The cranks!"" And his laughter ended
the discussion.

Hugo began. He walked up the brick steps of Melcher's residence and
pulled the glittering brass knob. A servant came to the door.

""Mr. Danner to see Mr. Melcher. Just a moment.""

A wait in the hall. The servant returned. ""Sorry, but he's not in.""

Hugo's mouth was firm. ""Please tell him that I saw him come in.""

""I'm sorry, sir, but he is going right out.""

""Tell him--that he will see me.""

The servant raised his voice. ""Harry!"" A heavy person with a flattened
nose and cauliflower ears stepped into the hall. ""This gentleman wishes
to see Mr. Melcher, and Mr. Melcher is not in--to him. Take care of him,
Harry."" The servant withdrew.

""Run along, fellow.""

Hugo smiled. ""Mr. Melcher keeps a bouncer?""

An evil light flickered in the other's eyes. ""Yeah, fellow. And I came
up from the Pennsy mines. I'm a tough guy, so beat it.""

""Not so tough your ears and nose aren't a sight,"" Hugo said lightly.

The man advanced. His voice was throaty. ""Git!""

""You go to the devil. I came here to see Melcher and I'm going to see
him.""

""Yeah?""

The tough one drew back his fist, but he never understood afterwards
what had taken place. He came to in the kitchen an hour later. Mr.
Melcher heard him rumble to the floor and emerged from the library. He
was a huge man, bigger than his bouncer; his face was hard and sinister
and it lighted with an unpleasant smile when he saw the unconscious thug
and measured the size of Hugo. ""Pulled a fast one on Harry, eh?""

""I came to see you, Melcher.""

""Well, might as well come in now. I worked up from the mines myself, and
I'm a hard egg. If you got funny with me, you'd get killed. Wha' daya
want?""

Hugo sat down in a leather chair and lit a cigarette. He was
comparatively without emotion. This was his appointed task and he would
make short shrift of it. ""I came here, Melcher,"" he began, ""to talk
about your part in the arms conferences. It happens that I disagree with
you and your propaganda. It happens that I have a method of enforcing my
opinion. Disarmament is a great thing for the world, and putting the
idea across is the first step toward even bigger things. I know the
relative truths of what you say about America's peril and what you get
from saying it. Am I clear?""

Melcher had reddened. He nodded. ""Perfectly.""

""I have nothing to add. Get out of town.""

Melcher's eyes narrowed. ""Do you really believe that sending me out of
town would do any good? Do you have the conceit to think that one nutty
shrimp like you can buck the will and ideas of millions of people?""

Hugo did not permit his convictions to be shaken. ""There happen to be
extenuating circumstances, Melcher.""

""Really? You surprise me."" The broad sarcasm was shaken like a weapon.
""And do you honestly think you could chase me--me--out of here?""

""I am sure of it.""

""How?""

Hugo extinguished his cigarette. ""I happen to be more than a man. I
am--"" he hesitated, seeking words--""let us say, a devil, or an angel, or
a scourge. I detest you and what you stand for. If you do not leave--I
can ruin your house and destroy you. And I will."" He finished his words
almost gently.

Melcher appeared to hesitate. ""All right. I'll go. Immediately. This
afternoon.""

Hugo was astonished. ""You will go?""

""I promise. Good afternoon, Mr. Danner.""

Hugo rose and walked toward the door. He was seething with surprise and
suspicion. Had he actually intimidated Melcher so easily? His hand
touched the knob. At that instant Melcher hit him on the head with a
chair. It broke in pieces. Hugo turned around slowly.

""I understand. You mistook me for a dangerous lunatic. I was puzzled for
a moment. Now--""

Melcher's jaw sagged in amazement when Hugo did not fall. An instant
later he threw himself forward, arms out, head drawn between his
shoulders. With one hand Hugo imprisoned his wrists. He lifted Melcher
from the floor and shook him. ""I meant it, Melcher. And I will give you
a sign. Rotten politics, graft, bad government, are doomed."" Melcher
watched with staring eyes while Hugo, with his free hand, rapidly
demolished the room. He picked up the great desk and smashed it, he tore
the stone mantelpiece from its roots; he kicked the fireplace apart; he
burst a hole in the brick wall--dragging the bulk of a man behind him as
he moved. ""Remember that, Melcher. No one else on earth is like me--and
I will get you if you fail to stop. I'll come for you if you squeal
about this--and I leave it to you to imagine what will happen.""

Hugo walked into the hall. ""You're all done for--you cheap swindlers.
And I am doom."" The door banged.

Melcher swayed on his feet, swallowed hard, and ran upstairs. ""Pack,"" he
said to his valet.

He had gone; Hugo had removed the first of the public enemies. Yet Hugo
was not satisfied. His approach to Melcher had been dramatic,
terrifying, effective. There were rumours of that violent morning. The
rumours said that Melcher had been attacked, that he had been bought out
for bigger money, that something peculiar was occurring in Washington.
If ten, twenty men left and those rumours multiplied by geometrical
progression, sheer intimidation would work a vast good.

But other facts disconcerted Hugo. In the first place, his mind kept
reverting to Melcher's words: ""Do you have the conceit to think that one
person can buck the will of millions?"" No matter how powerful that
person, his logic added. Millions of dollars or people? the same logic
questioned. After all, did it matter? People could be perjured by
subtler influences than gold. Secondly, the parley over arms continued
to be an impasse despite the absence of Melcher. Perhaps, he argued, he
had not removed Melcher soon enough. A more carefully focused
consideration showed that, in spite of what Hatten had said. It was not
individuals against whom the struggle was made, but mass stupidity,
gigantic bulwarks of human incertitude. And a new man came in Melcher's
place--a man who employed different tactics. Hugo could not exorcise the
world.

A few days later Hugo learned that two radicals had been thrown into
jail on a charge of murder. The event had taken place in Newark, New
Jersey. A federal officer had attempted to break up a meeting. He had
been shot. The men arrested were blamed, although it was evident that
they were chance seizures, that their proved guilt could be at most only
a social resentfulness. At first no one gave the story much attention.
The slow wheels of Jersey justice--printed always in quotation marks by
the dailies--began to turn. The men were summarily tried and convicted
of murder in the first degree. A mob assaulted the jail where they were
confined--without success. Two of the mob were wounded by riot guns.

A meeting was held in Berlin, one in London, another in Paris. Moscow
was silent, but Moscow was reported to be in an uproar. The trial
assumed international proportions overnight. Embassies were stormed;
legations from America were forced to board cruisers. Strikes were
ordered; long queues of sullen men and women formed at camp kitchens.
The President delivered a message to Congress on the subject. Prominent
personages debated it in public halls, only to be acclaimed and booed
concomitantly. The sentence imposed on two Russian immigrants rocked the
world. In some cities it was not safe for American tourists to go abroad
in the streets. And all the time the two men drew nearer to the electric
chair.

It was then that Hugo met Skorvsky. Many people knew him; he was a
radical, a writer; he lived in Washington, he styled himself an
unofficial ambassador of the world. A small, dark man with a black
moustache who attended one of Hugo's informal afternoon discussions on a
vicarious invitation. ""Come over and see Hugo Danner. He's something new
in Washington.""

""Something new in Washington? I shall omit the obvious sarcasm. I shall
go."" Skorvsky went.

Hugo listened to him talk about the two prisoners. He was lucid; he
made allowances for the American democracy, which in themselves were
burning criticism. Hugo asked him to dinner. They dined at Hugo's house.

""You have the French taste in wines,"" Skorvsky said, ""but, as it is to
my mind the finest taste in the world, I can say only that.""

Hugo tried to lead him back to the topic that interested both of them so
acutely. Skorvsky shrugged. ""You are polite--or else you are curious. I
know you--an American business man in Washington with a purpose. Not an
apparent purpose--just now. No, no. Just now you are a host, cultivated
and genial, and retiring. But at the proper time--ah! A dam somewhere in
Arizona. A forest that you covet in Alaska. Is it not so?""

""What if it is not?""

Skorvsky stared at the ceiling. ""What then? A secret? Yes, I thought
that about you while we were talking to the others to-day. There is
something deep about you, my new friend. You are a power. Possibly you
are not even really an American.""

""That is wrong.""

""You assure me that I am right. But I will agree with you. You are, let
us say, the very epitome of the man Mr. Mencken and Mr. Lewis tell us
about so charmingly. I am Russian and I cannot know all of America. You
might divulge your errand, perhaps?""

""Suppose I said it was to set the world aright?""

Skorvsky laughed lightly. ""Then I should throw myself at your feet.""

Both men were in deadly earnest, Hugo not quite willing to adopt the
Russian's almost effeminate delicacy, yet eager to talk to him, or to
someone like him--someone who was more than a great self-centred wheel
in the progress of the nation. Hugo yielded a little further. ""Yet that
is my purpose. And I am not altogether impotent. There are things I can
do--"" He got up from the table and stretched himself with a feline
grace.

""Such as?""

""I was thinking of your two compatriots who were recently given such
wretched justice. Suppose they were liberated by force. What then?""

""Ah! You are an independent communist?""

""Not even that. Just a friend of progress.""

""So. A dreamer. One of the few who have wealth. And you have a plan to
free these men?""

Hugo shrugged. ""I merely speculated on the possible outcome of such a
thing; assume that they were snatched from prison and hidden beyond the
law.""

Skorvsky meditated. ""It would be a great victory for the cause, of
course. A splendid lift to its morale.""

""The cause of Bolshevism?""

""A higher and a different cause. I cannot explain it briefly. Perhaps I
cannot explain it at all. But the old world of empires is crumbled.
Democracy is at its farcical height. The new world is not yet manifest.
I shall be direct. What is your plan, Mr. Danner?""

""I couldn't tell you. Anyway, you would not believe it. But I could
guarantee to deliver those two men anywhere in the country within a few
days without leaving a trace of how it was done. What do you think of
that, Skorvsky?""

""I think you are a dangerous and a valuable man.""

""Not many people do."" Hugo's eyes were moody. ""I have been thinking
about it for a long time. Nothing that I can remember has happened
during my life that gives me a greater feeling of understanding than the
imprisonment and sentencing of those men. I know poignantly the glances
that are given them, the stupidity of the police and the courts, the
horror-stricken attitude of those who condemn them without knowledge of
the truth or a desire for such knowledge."" He buried his face in his
hands and then looked up quickly. ""I know all that passionately and
intensely. I know the blind fury to which it all gives birth. I hate it.
I detest it. Selfishness, stupidity, malice. I know the fear it
engenders--a dreadful and a justified fear. I've felt it. Very little in
this world avails against it. You'll forgive so much sentiment,
Skorvsky?""

""It makes us brothers."" The Russian spoke with force and simplicity.
""You, too--""

Hugo crossed the room restlessly. ""I don't know. I am always losing my
grip. I came to Washington with a purpose and I cannot screw myself to
it unremittingly. These men seem--""

Skorvsky was thinking. ""Your plan for them. What assistance would you
need?""

""None.""

""None!""

""Why should I need help? I--never mind. I need none.""

""You have your own organization?""

""There is no one but me.""

Skorvsky shook his head. ""I cannot--and yet--looking at you--I believe
you can. I shall tell you. You will come with me to-night and meet my
friends--those who are working earnestly for a new America, an America
ruled by intelligence alone. Few outsiders enter our councils. We are
all--nearly all--foreigners. Yet we are more American than the Maine
fisherman, the Minnesota farmer. Behind us is a party that grows apace.
This incident in New Jersey has added to it, as does every dense mumble
of Congress, every scandalous metropolitan investigation. I shall
telephone.""

Hugo allowed himself to be conducted half-dubiously. But what he found
was superficially, at least, what he had dreamed for himself. The house
to which he was taken was pretentious; the people in its salon were
amiable and educated; there was no sign of the red flag, the ragged
reformer, the anarchist. The women were gracious; the men witty. As he
talked to them, one by one, he began to believe that here was the
nucleus around which he could construct his imaginary empire. He became
interested; he expanded.

It was late in the night when Skorvsky raised his voice slightly, so
that everyone would listen, and made an announcement: ""Friends, I have
had the honour to introduce Mr. Danner to you. Now I have the greater
honour of telling you his purpose and pledge. To-morrow night he will go
to New Jersey""--the silence became absolute--""and two nights later he
will bring to us in person from their cells Davidoff and Pletzky.""

A quick, pregnant pause was followed by excitement. They took Hugo by
the hand, some of them applauded, one or two cheered, they shouldered
near him, they asked questions and expressed doubts. It was broad
daylight before they dispersed. Hugo walked to his house, listening to a
long rhapsody from Skorvsky.

""We will make you a great man if you succeed,"" Skorvsky said.
""Good-night, comrade.""

""Good-night."" Hugo went into the hall and up to his bedroom. He sat on
his bed. A dullness overcame him. He had never been patronized quite in
the same way as he had that night; it exerted at once a corrosive and a
lethargic influence. He undressed slowly, dropping his shoes on the
floor. Splendid people they were, he thought. A smaller voice suggested
to him that he did not really care to go to New Jersey for the
prisoners. They would be hard to locate. There would be a sensation and
a mystery again. Still, he had found a purpose.

His telephone rang. He reached automatically from the bed. The room was
bright with sunshine, which meant that it was late in the day. His brain
took reluctant hold on consciousness. ""Hello?""

""Hello? Danner, my friend--""

""Oh, hello, Skorvsky--""

""May I come up? It is important.""

""Sure. I'm still in bed. But come on.""

Hugo was under the shower bath when his visitor arrived. He invited
Skorvsky to share his breakfast, but was impatiently refused. ""Things
have happened since last night, Comrade Danner. For one, I saw the
chief.""

""Chief?""

""You have not met him as yet. We conferred about your scheme. He--I
regret to say--opposed it.""

Hugo nodded. ""I'm not surprised. I'll tell you what to do. You take me
to him--and I'll prove conclusively that it will be successful. Then,
perhaps, he will agree to sanction it. Every time I think of those two
poor devils--snatched from a mob--waiting there in the dark for the
electric chair--it makes my blood boil.""

""Quite,"" Skorvsky agreed. ""But you do not understand. It is not that he
doubts your ability--if you failed it would not be important. He fears
you might accomplish it. I assured him you would. I have faith in you.""

""He's afraid I would do it? That doesn't make sense, Skorvsky.""

""It does, I regret to say."" His expressive face stirred with discomfort.
""We were too hasty, too precipitate. I see his reason now. We cannot
afford as a group to be branded as jail-breakers.""

""That's--weak,"" Hugo said.

Skorvsky cleared his throat. ""There are other matters. Since Davidoff
and Pletzky were jailed, the party has grown by leaps and bounds. Money
has poured in--""

""Ah,"" Hugo said softly, ""money.""

Skorvsky raged. ""Go ahead. Be sarcastic. To free those men would cost us
a million dollars, perhaps.""

""Too bad.""

""With a million--the million their electrocution will bring from the
outraged--we can accomplish more than saving two paltry lives. We must
be hard, we must think ahead.""

""In thinking ahead, Skorvsky, do you not think of the closing of a
switch and the burning of human flesh?""

""For every cause there must be martyrs. Their names will live
eternally.""

""And they themselves--?""

""Bah! You are impractical.""

""Perhaps."" Hugo ate a slice of toast with outward calm. ""I was hoping
for a government that--did not weigh people against dollars--""

""Nor do we!""

""No?""

Skorvsky leaped to his feet. ""Fool! Dreamer! Preposterous idealist! I
must be going.""

Hugo sighed. ""Suppose I went ahead?""

""One thing!"" The Russian turned with a livid face. ""One thing the chief
bade me tell you. If those men escape--you die.""

""Oh,"" Hugo said. He stared through the window. ""And supposing I were to
offer your chief a million--or nearly a million--for the privilege of
freeing them?""

Skorvsky's face returned to its look of transfiguration, the look that
had accompanied his noblest words of the night before. ""You would do
that, comrade?"" he whispered. ""You would give us--give the cause--a
million? Never since the days of our Saviour has a man like you walked
on this--""

Hugo stood up suddenly. ""Get out of here!"" His voice was a cosmic
menace. ""Get out of here, you dirty swine. Get out of here before I
break you to matchwood, before I rip out your guts and stuff them back
through your filthy, lying throat. Get out, oh, God, get out!""

Hugo realized at last that there was no place in his world for him.
Tides and tempest, volcanoes and lightning, all other majestic
vehemences of the universe had a purpose, but he had none. Either
because he was all those forces unnaturally locked in the body of a man,
or because he was a giant compelled to stoop and pander to live at all
among his feeble fellows, his anachronism was complete.

That much he perceived calmly. His tragedy lay in the lie he had told to
his father: great deeds were always imminent and none of them could be
accomplished because they involved humanity, humanity protecting its
diseases, its pettiness, its miserable convictions and conventions, with
the essence of itself--life. Life not misty and fecund for the future,
but life clawing at the dollar in the hour, the security of platitudes,
the relief of visible facts, the hope in rationalization, the needs of
skin, belly, and womb.

Beyond that, he could see destiny by interpreting his limited career.
Through a sort of ontogenetic recapitulation he had survived his savage
childhood, his barbaric youth, and the Greeces, Romes, Egypts, and
Babylons of his early manhood, emerging into a present that was endowed
with as much aspiration and engaged with the same futility as was his
contemporary microcosm. No life span could observe anything but material
progress, for so mean and inalterable is the gauge of man that his races
topple before his soul expands, and the eventualities of his growth in
space and time must remain a problem for thousands and tens of thousands
of years.

Searching still further, he appreciated that no single man could force a
change upon his unwilling fellows. At most he might inculcate an idea in
a few and live to see its gradual spreading. Even then he could have no
assurance of its contortions to the desire for wealth and power or of
the consequences of those contortions.

Finally, to build, one must first destroy, and he questioned his right
to select unaided the objects for destruction. He looked at the Capitol
in Washington and pondered the effect of issuing an ultimatum and
thereafter bringing down the great dome like Samson. He thought of the
churches and their bewildering, stupefying effect on masses who were
mulcted by their own fellows, equally bewildered, equally stupefied.
Suppose through a thousand nights he ravaged the churches, wrecking
every structure in the land, laying waste property, making the loud,
unattended volume of worship an impossibility, taking away the
purple-robed gods of his forbears? Suppose he sank the navy, annihilated
the army, set up a despotism? No matter how efficiently and well he
ruled, the millions would hate him, plot against him, attempt his life;
and every essential agent would be a hypocritical sycophant seeking
selfish ends.

He reached the last of his conclusions sitting beside a river whither he
had walked to think. An immense loathing for the world rose up in him.
At its apex a locomotive whistled in the distance, thundered
inarticulately, and rounded a bend. It came very near the place where
Hugo reclined, black, smoking, and noisy, drivers churning along the
rails, a train of passenger cars behind. Hugo could see the dots that
were people's heads. People! Human beings! How he hated them! The train
was very near. Suddenly all his muscles were unsprung. He threw himself
to his feet and rushed toward the train, with a passionate desire to get
his fingers around the sliding piston, to up-end the locomotive and to
throw the ordered machinery into a blackened, blazing, bloody tangle of
ruin.

His lips uttered a wild cry; he jumped across the river and ran two
prodigious steps. Then he stopped. The train went on unharmed. Hugo
shuddered.

If the world did not want him, he would leave the world. Perhaps he was
a menace to it. Perhaps he should kill himself. But his burning,
sickened heart refused once more to give up. Frenzy departed, then
numbness. In its place came a fresh hope, new determination. Hugo Danner
would do his utmost until the end. Meanwhile, he would remove himself
some distance from the civilization that had tortured him. He would go
away and find a new dream.

The sound of the locomotive was dead in the distance. He crossed the
river on a bridge and went back to his house. He felt strong again and
glad--glad because he had won an obscure victory, glad because the farce
of his quest in political government had ended with no tragic
dénouement.

They were electrocuting Davidoff and Pletzky that day. The news scarcely
interested Hugo. The part he had very nearly played in the affair seemed
like the folly of a dimly remembered acquaintance. The relief of
resigning that impossible purpose overwhelmed him. He dismissed his
servants, closed his house, and boarded a train. When the locomotive
pounded through the station, he suffered a momentary pang. He sat in a
seat with people all around him. He was tranquil and almost content.




XXIII


Hugo had no friends. One single individual whom he loved, whom he could
have taken fully into his confidence, might, in a measure, have resolved
his whole life. Yet so intense was the pressure that had conditioned him
that he invariably retreated before the rare opportunities for such
confidences. He had known many persons well: his father and mother, Anna
Blake, Lefty Foresman, Charlotte, Iris, Tom Shayne, Roseanne, even
Skorvsky--but none of them had known him. His friendlessness was
responsible for a melancholy yearning to remain with his kind. Having
already determined to go away, he sought for a kind of compromise.

He did not want to be in New York, or Washington, or any other city; the
landscape of America was haunted for him. He would leave it, but he
would not open himself to the cruel longing for his own language, the
sight of familiar customs and manners. From his hotel in New York he
made excursions to various steamship agencies and travel bureaus. He
had seen many lands, and his _Wanderlust_ demanded novelty. For days he
was undecided.

It was a chance group of photographs in a Sunday newspaper that excited
his first real interest. One of the pictures was of a man--erect,
white-haired, tanned, clear-eyed--Professor Daniel Hardin--a procession
of letters--head of the new expedition to Yucatan. The other pictures
were of ruined temples, unpiled stone causeways, jungle. He thought
instantly that he would like to attach himself to the party.

Many factors combined to make the withdrawal offered by an expedition
ideal. The more Hugo thought about it, the more excited he became. The
very nascency of a fresh objective was accompanied by and crowded with
new hints for himself and his problems. The expedition would take him
away from his tribulations, and it would not entirely cut him off from
his kind: Professor Hardin had both the face and the fame of a
distinguished man.

A thought that had been in the archives of his mind for many months came
sharply into relief: of all human beings alive, the scientists were the
only ones who retained imagination, ideals, and a sincere interest in
the larger world. It was to them he should give his allegiance, not to
the statesmen, not to industry or commerce or war. Hugo felt that in one
quick glimpse he had made a long step forward.

Another concept, far more fantastic and in a way even more intriguing,
dawned in his mind as he read accounts of the Maya ruins which were to
be excavated. The world was cluttered with these great lumps of
incredible architecture. Walls had been builded by primitive man,
temples, hanging gardens, obelisks, pyramids, palaces, bridges,
terraces, roads--all of them gigantic and all of them defying the
penetration of archæology to find the manner of their creation. Was it
not possible--Hugo's heart skipped a beat when it occurred to him--that
in their strange combination of ignorance and brilliance the ancients
had stumbled upon the secret of human strength--his secret! Had not
those antique and migratory peoples carried with them the formula which
could be poured into the veins of slaves, making them stronger than
engines? And was it not conceivable that, as their civilizations
crumbled, the secret was lost, together with so many other formulæ of
knowledge?

He could imagine plumed and painted priests with prayer and sacrifice
cutting open the veins of prehistoric mothers and pouring in the magic
potion. When the babies grew, they could raise up the pyramids, walls,
and temples; they could do it rapidly and easily. A great enigma was
thus resolved. He set out immediately to locate Professor Hardin and
with difficulty arranged an interview with him.

Preparations for the expedition were being carried on in an ordinary New
York business office. A secretary announced Hugo and he was conducted
before the professor. Daniel Hardin was no dusty pedagogue. His
knowledge was profound and academic, his books were authoritative, but
in himself he belonged to the type of man certain to succeed, whatever
his choice of occupation. Much of his life had been spent in field
work--arduous toil in bizarre lands where life depended sometimes on
tact and sometimes on military strategy. He appraised Hugo shrewdly
before he spoke.

""What can I do for you, Mr. Danner?""

Hugo came directly to the point. ""I should like to join your Yucatan
expedition.""

Professor Hardin smiled. ""I'm sorry. We're full up.""

""I'd be glad to go in any capacity--""

""Have you special qualifications? Knowledge of the language? Of
archæology?""

""No.""

The professor picked up a tray of letters. ""These letters--more than
three hundred--are all from young men--and women--who would like to join
my expedition.""

""I think I should be useful,"" Hugo said, and then he played his trump,
""and I should be willing to contribute, for the favour of being
included, a sum of fifty thousand dollars.""

Professor Hardin whistled. Then his eyes narrowed. ""What's your object,
young man? Treasure?""

""No. A life--let us say--with ample means at my disposal and no definite
purpose.""

""Boredom, then."" He smiled. ""A lot of these other young men are
independently wealthy, and bored. I must say, I feel sorry for your
generation. But--no--I can't accept. We are already adequately
financed.""

Hugo smiled in response. ""Then--perhaps--I could organize my own party
and camp near you.""

""That would hamper me.""

""Then--a hundred thousand dollars.""

""Good Lord. You are determined.""

""I have decided. I am familiar with the jungle. I am an athlete. I speak
a little Spanish--enough to boss a labour gang. I propose to assist you
in that way, as well as financially. I will make any contract with you
that you desire--and attach no strings whatever to my money.""

Professor Hardin pondered for a long time. His eyes twinkled when he
replied. ""You won't believe it, but I don't give a damn for your money.
Not that it wouldn't assist us. But--the fact is--I could use a man like
you. Anybody could. I'll take you--and you can keep your money.""

""There will be a check in the mail to-morrow,"" Hugo answered.

The professor stood. ""We're hoping to get away in three weeks. You'll
leave your address with my secretary and I'll send a list of the things
you'll want for your kit."" He held out his hand and Hugo shook it. When
he had gone, the professor looked over the roof-tops and swore gleefully
to himself.

Hugo discovered, after the ship sailed, that everyone called Professor
Hardin ""Dan"" and they used Hugo's first name from the second day out.
Dan Hardin was too busy to be very friendly with any of the members of
his party during the voyage, but they themselves fraternized
continually. There were deck games and card games; there were long and
erudite arguments about the people whom they were going to study. What
was the Mayan time cycle and did it correspond to the Egyptian Sothic
cycle or the Greek Metonic cycle. Where did the Mayans get their jade?
Did they come from Asia over Bering Strait or were they a colony of
Atlantis? When they knew so much about engineering, why did they not use
the keystone arch and the wheel? Why was their civilization decadent,
finished when the _conquistadores_ discovered it? How old were
they--four thousand years or twelve thousand years? There were
innumerable other debates to which Hugo listened like a man new-born.

The cold Atlantic winds were transformed overnight to the balm of the
Gulf stream. Presently they passed the West Indies, which lay on the
water like marine jewels. Ages turned back through the days of
buccaneering to the more remote times. In the port of Xantl a rickety
wharf, a single white man, a zinc bar, and a storehouse filled with
chicle blocks marked off the realm of the twentieth century. The ship
anchored. During the next year it would make two voyages back to the
homeland for supplies. But the explorers would not emerge from the
jungle in that time.

An antiquated, wood-burning locomotive, which rocked along over
treacherous rails, carried them inland. The scientists became silent and
pensive. In another car the Maya Indians who were to do the manual
labour chattered incessantly in their explosive tongue. At the last
sun-baked stop they disembarked, slept through an insect-droning night,
and entered the jungle. For three weeks they hacked and hewed their way
forward; the vegetation closed behind them, cutting off the universe as
completely as the submerging waves of the sea. It was hot, difficult
work, to which Hugo lent himself with an energy that astounded even
Hardin, who had judged him valuable.

One day, when the high mountains loomed into view, Hugo caught his first
glimpse of Uctotol, the Sacred City. A creeper on the hillside fell
before his machete, then another--a hole in the green wall--and there it
stood, shining white, huge, desolate, still as the grave. His arm hung
in mid-air. Over him passed the mystic feeling of familiarity, that
fugitive sense of recognition which springs so readily into a belief in
immortality. It seemed to him during that staggering instant that he
knew every contour of those great structures, that he had run in the
streets, lived, loved, died there--that he could almost remember the
names and faces of its inhabitants, dead for thousands of years--that he
could nearly recall the language and the music--that destiny itself had
arranged a home-coming. The vision died. He gave a great shout. The
others rushed to his side and found him trembling and pointing.

Tons of verdure were cut down and pushed aside. A hacienda was
constructed and a camp for the labourers. Then the shovels and picks
were broken from their boxes; the scientists arranged their
paraphernalia, and the work began, interrupted frequently by the
exultant shouts that marked a new finding. No one regretted Hugo. He
made his men work magically; his example was a challenge. He could do
more than any of them, and his hair and eyes, black as their own, his
granite face, stern and indefatigable, gave him a natural dominion over
them.

All this--the dark, starlit, plushy nights with their hypnotic silences,
the vivid days of toil, the patient and single-minded men--was respite
to Hugo. It salved his tribulations. It brought him to a gradual
assurance that any work with such men would be sufficient for him. He
was going backward into the world instead of forward; that did not
matter. He stood on the frontier of human knowledge. He was a factor in
its preparation, and if what they carried back with them was no more
than history, if it cast no new light on existing wants and
perplexities, it still served a splendid purpose. Months rolled by
unheeded; Hugo gathered friends among these men--and the greatest of
those friends was Daniel Hardin.

In their isolation and occasional loneliness each of them little by
little stripped his past for the others. Only Hugo remained silent about
himself until his reticence was conspicuous. He might never have spoken,
except for the accident.

It was, in itself, a little thing, which happened apart from the main
field of activity. Hugo and two Indians were at work on a small temple
at the city's fringe. Hardin came down to see. The great stone in the
roof, crumbled by ages, slipped and teetered. Underneath the professor
stood, unheeding. But Hugo saw. He caught the mass of rock in his arms
and lifted it to one side. And Dan Hardin turned in time to perceive the
full miracle.

When Hugo lifted his head, he knew. Yet, to his astonishment, there was
no look of fear in Hardin's blue eyes. Instead, they were moderately
surprised, vastly interested. He did not speak for some time. Then he
said: ""Thanks, Danner. I believe you saved my life. Should you mind
picking up that rock again?""

Hugo dismissed the Indians with a few words. He glanced again at Hardin
to make sure of his composure. Then he lifted the square stone back to
its position.

Hardin was thinking aloud. ""That stone must weigh four tons. No man
alive can handle four tons like that. How do you do it, Hugo?""

Hot, streaming sun. Tumbled débris. This profound question asked again,
asked mildly for the first time. ""My father--was a biologist. A great
biologist. I was--an experiment.""

""Good Lord! And--and that's why you've kept your past dark, Hugo?""

""Of course. Not many people--""

""Survive the shock? You forget that we--here--are all scientists. I
won't press you.""

""Perhaps,"" Hugo heard himself saying, ""I'd like to tell you.""

""In that case--in my room--to-night. I should like to hear.""

That night, after a day of indecision, Hugo sat in a dim light and
poured out the story of his life. Hardin never interrupted, never
commented, until the end. Then he said softly: ""You poor devil. Oh, you
poor bastard."" And Hugo saw that he was weeping. He tried to laugh.

""It isn't as bad as that--Dan.""

""Son""--his voice choked with emotion--""this thing--this is my life-work.
This is why you came to my office last winter. This is--the most
important thing on earth. What a story! What a man you are!""

""On the contrary--""

""Don't be modest. I know. I feel. I understand.""

Hugo's head shook sadly. ""Perhaps not. You can see--I have tried
everything. In itself, it is great. I can see that. It is, objectively,
the most important thing on earth. But the other way--What can I do?
Tell me that. You cannot tell me. I can destroy. As nothing that ever
came before or will come again, I can destroy. But destruction--as I
believe, as you believe--is at best only a step toward re-creation. And
what can I make afterwards? Think. Think, man! Rack your brains! What?""
His hands clenched and unclenched. ""I can build great halls and palaces.
Futile! I can make bridges. I can rip open mountains and take out the
gold. I am that strong. It is as if my metabolism was atomic instead of
molecular. But what of it? Stretch your imagination to its uttermost
limits--and what can I do that is more than an affair of petty profit to
myself? Mankind has already extended its senses and its muscles to their
tenth powers. He can already command engines to do what I can do. It is
not necessary that he become an engine himself. It is preposterous that
he should think of it--even to transcend his engines. I defy you, I defy
you with all my strength, to think of what I can do to justify myself!""

The words had been wrung from Hugo. Perspiration trickled down his face.
He bit his lips to check himself. The older man was grave. ""All your
emotions, your reflections, your yearnings and passions, come--to that.
And yet--""

""Look at me in another light,"" Hugo went on. ""I've tried to give you an
inkling of it. You were the first who saw what I could do--glimpsed a
fraction of it, rather--and into whose face did not come fear, loathing,
even hate. Try to live with a sense of that. I can remember almost back
to the cradle that same thing. First it was envy and jealousy. Then, as
I grew stronger, it was fear, alarm, and the thing that comes from
fear--hatred. That is another and perhaps a greater obstacle. If I found
something to do, the whole universe would be against me. These little
people! Can you imagine what it is to be me and to look at people? A
crowd at a ball game? A parade? Can you?""

""Great God,"" the scientist breathed.

""When I see them for what they are, and when they exert the tremendous
bulk of their united detestation and denial against me, when I feel rage
rising inside myself--can you conceive--?""

""That's enough. I don't want to try to think. Not of that. I--""

""Shall I walk to my grave afraid that I shall let go of myself,
searching everywhere for something to absorb my energy? Shall I?""

""No.""

The professor spoke with a firm concentration. Hugo arrested himself.
""Then what?""

""Did it ever dawn on you that you had missed your purpose entirely?""

The words were like cold water to Hugo. He pulled himself together with
a physical effort and replied: ""You mean--that I have not guessed it so
far?""

""Precisely.""

""It never occurred to me. Not that I had missed it entirely.""

""You have.""

""Then, for the love of God, what is it?""

Hardin smiled a gentle, wise smile. ""Easy there. I'll tell you. And
listen well, Hugo, because to-night I feel inspired. The reason you have
missed it is simple. You've tried to do everything single-handed--""

""On the contrary. Every kind of assistance I have enlisted has failed me
utterly.""

""Except one kind.""

""Science?""

""No. Your own kind, Hugo.""

The words did not convey their meaning for several seconds. Then Hugo
gasped. ""You mean--other men like me?""

""Exactly. Other men like you. Not one or two. Scores, hundreds. And
women. All picked with the utmost care. Eugenic offspring. Cultivated
and reared in secret by a society for the purpose. Not necessarily your
children, but the children of the best parents. Perfect bodies,
intellectual minds, your strength. Don't you see it, Hugo? You are not
the reformer of the old world. You are the beginning of the new. We
begin with a thousand of you. Living by yourselves and multiplying, you
produce your own arts and industries and ideals. The new Titans!
Then--slowly--you dominate the world. Conquer and stamp out all these
things to which you and I and all men of intelligence object. In the
end--you are alone and supreme.""

Hugo groaned. ""To make a thousand men live my life--""

""But they will not. Suppose you had been proud of your strength. Suppose
you had not been compelled to keep it a secret. Suppose you could have
found glorious uses for it from childhood--""

""In the mountains,"" Hugo whispered, his eyes bemused, ""where the sun is
warm and the days long--these children growing. Even here, in this
place--""

""So I thought. Don't you see, Hugo?""

""Yes, I see. At last, thank God, I do see!""

For a long time their thoughts ran wild. When they cooled, it was to
formulate plans. A child taken here. Another there. A city in the
jungle--the jungle had harboured races before: not only these Mayas, but
the Incas, Khmers, and others. A modern city for dwellings, and these
tremendous ruins would be the blocks for the nursery. They would teach
them art and architecture--and science. Engineering, medicine--their
own, undiscovered medicine--the new Titans, the sons of dawn--so ran
their inspired imaginations.

When the night was far advanced and the camp was wrapped in slumber,
they made a truce with this divine fire. They shook each other's hands.

""Good-night, Hugo. And to-morrow we'll go over the notes.""

""I'll bring them.""

""Till evening, then.""

Hugo lay on his bed, more ecstatic than he had ever been in his life. By
and by he slept. Then, as if the ghosts of Uctotol had risen, his mind
was troubled by a host, a pageant of dreams. He turned in his sleep,
rending his blankets. He moaned and mumbled. When he woke, he understood
that his soul had undergone another of its diametric inversions. The mad
fancies of the night before had died and memory could not rekindle them.
Little dreads had goaded away their brightness. Conscience was bickering
inside him. Humanity was content; it would hate his new race. And the
new race, being itself human, might grow top-heavy with power. If his
theory about the great builders of the past was true, then perhaps this
incubus would explain why the past was no more. If his Titans disagreed
and made war on each other--surely that would end the earth. He quailed.

Overcome by a desire to think more about this giants' scheme, he avoided
Hardin. In the siesta hour he went back to his tent and procured the
books wherein his father had written the second secret of life. He
crammed them into his pocket and broke through the jungle. When he was
beyond sight and sound, he dropped his machete and made his way as none
but he could do. With his body he cut a swath toward the mountains and
emerged from the green veil on to the bare rocks, panting and hot.
Upward he climbed until he had gained the summit. To the west were
strewn the frozen billows of the range. To the east a limitless sea of
verdure. At his feet the ruins in neat miniature, like a model. Above,
scalding sun and blue sky. Around him a wind, strangely chill. And
silence.

He sat with his head on his hands until his thoughts were disturbed. A
humid breath had risen sluggishly from the jungle floor. The sun was
dull. Looking toward the horizon, he could see a black cloud. For an
instant he was frightened, the transformation had been so gigantic and
so soundless. He knew a sudden, urgent impulse to go back to the valley.
He disobeyed it and watched the coming of the storm. The first rapier of
lightning through the bowels of the approaching cloud warned him again.
Staunchly he stood. He had come there to think.

""I must go back and begin this work,"" he told himself. ""I have found a
friend!"" The cloud was descending. Thunder ruminated in heaven's garret.
""It is folly,"" he repeated, ""folly, folly, folly in the face of God.""
Now the sun went out like an extinguished lamp, and the horizon crept
closer. A curtain of torrential rain was lowered in the north. ""They
will make the earth beautiful,"" he said, and ever and again: ""This thing
is not beautiful. It is wrong."" His agitation increased rapidly. The
cloud was closing on the mountain like a huge hand. The muscles in his
legs quivered.

""If there were only a God,"" he whispered, ""what a prayer I would make!""
Then the wind came like a visible thing, pushing its fingers over the
vegetation below, and whirling up the mountain, laden with dust. After
the wind, the rain--heavy, roaring rain that fell, not in separate
drops, but in thick streams. The lightning was incessant. It illuminated
remote, white-topped peaks, which, in the fury of the storm, appeared to
be swaying. It split clouds apart, and the hurricane healed the rents.
All light went out. The world was wrapped in darkness.

Hugo clutched his precious books in the remnants of his clothing and
braced himself on the bare rock. His voice roared back into the storm
the sounds it gave. He flung one hand upward.

""Now--God--oh, God--if there be a God--tell me! Can I defy You? Can I
defy Your world? Is this Your will? Or are You, like all mankind,
impotent? Oh, God!"" He put his hand to his mouth and called God like a
name into the tumult above. Madness was upon him and the bitter irony
with which his blood ran black was within him.

A bolt of lightning stabbed earthward. It struck Hugo, outlining him in
fire. His hand slipped away from his mouth. His voice was quenched. He
fell to the ground.

After three days of frantic searching, Daniel Hardin came upon the
incredible passage through the jungle and followed it to the mountain
top. There he found the blackened body of Hugo Danner, lying face down.
His clothing was burned to ashes, and an accumulation of cinders was
all that remained of the notebooks. After discovering that, Professor
Hardin could not forbear to glance aloft at the sun and sky. His face
was saddened and perplexed.

""We will carry him yonder to Uctotol and bury him,"" he said at last;
""then--the work will go on.""

""She will reach the wharf in half an hour.""

The speaker shaded her eyes with a great fan of carved ivory and painted
silk.  They were beautiful eyes; large, brown, perfect in shape and
expression, and set in a lovely, imperious, laughing face.  The divinity
to whom they belonged was clad in a gown of green dimity, flowered with
pink roses, and trimmed about the neck and half sleeves with a fall of
yellow lace.  The gown was made according to the latest Paris mode, as
described in a year-old letter from the court of Charles the Second, and
its wearer gazed from under her fan towards the waters of the great bay
of Chesapeake, in his Majesty’s most loyal and well beloved dominion of
Virginia.

The object of her attention was a large sloop that had left the bay and
was sailing up a wide inlet or creek that pierced the land, cork-screw
fashion, until it vanished from sight amidst innumerable green marshes.
The channel, indicated by a deeper blue in the midst of an expanse of
shoal water, was narrow, and wound like a gleaming snake in and out
among the interminable succession of marsh islets. The vessel, following
its curves, tacked continually its great sail, intensely white against
the blue of inlet, bay and sky, and the shadeless green of the marshes,
zigzagging from side to side with provoking leisureliness. The girl who
had spoken watched it eagerly, a color in her cheeks, and one little
foot in its square-toed, rosetted shoe tapping impatiently upon the
floor of the wide porch in which she stood.

Her companion, lounging upon the wooden steps, with his back to a
pillar, looked up with an amused light in his blue eyes.

""Why are you so eager, cousin?"" he drawled. ""You cannot be pining for
your father when ’t is scarce five days since he went to Jamestown.  Do
the Virginia ladies watch for the arrival of a new batch of slaves with
such impatience?""

""The slaves!  No, indeed!  But, sir, in that boat there are three cases
from England.""

""Ah, that accounts for it!  And what may these wonderful cases contain?""

""One contains the dress in which I shall dance with you at the party at
Green Spring which the governor is to give in your honor—if you ask me,
sir. Oh, I take it for granted that you will, so spare us your
protestations.  ’T is to have a petticoat of blue tabby and an overdress
of white satin trimmed with yards and yards of Venice point.  The
stockings are blue silk, and come from the French house in Covent
Garden, as doth the scarf of striped gauze, and the shoes, gallooned
with silver.  Then there are my combs, gloves, a laced waistcoat, a red
satin bodice, a scarlet taffetas mantle, a plumed hat, a pair of clasped
garters, a riding mask, a string of pearls, and the latest romances.""

""A pretty list!  Is that all?""

""There are things for aunt Lettice, petticoats and ribbons, a gilt
stomacher and a China monster, and for my father, lace ruffles and
bands, a pair of French laced boots, a periwig, a new scabbard for his
rapier, and so on.""

The young man laughed.  ""’T is a curious life you Virginians lead,"" he
said.  ""The embroidered suits and ruffles, the cosmetics and perfumes of
Whitehall in the midst of oyster beds and tobacco fields, savage Indians
and negro slaves.""

The girl put on a charming look of mock offense. ""We _are_ a little bit
of England set down here in the wilderness.  Why should we not clothe
ourselves like gentlefolk as well as our kindred and friends at home?
And sure both England and Virginia have had enough of sad colored
raiment.  Better go like a peacock than like a horrid Roundhead.""

Her companion laughed musically and sang a stave of a cavalier love
song.  He was a slender, well-made man, dressed in the extreme of the
mode of the year of grace, sixteen hundred and sixty-three, in a richly
laced suit of camlet with points of blue ribbon, and the great scented
periwig then newly come into fashion. The close curled rings of hair
descending far over his cravat of finest Holland framed a handsome,
lazily insolent face, with large steel-blue eyes and beautifully cut,
mocking lips.  A rapier with a jeweled hilt hung at his side, and one
white hand, half buried in snowy ruffles, held a beribboned cane with
which, as he talked, he ruthlessly decapitated the pink and white
morning-glories with which the porch was trellised.

The house to which the porch belonged was long and low, built of wood,
with many small windows, and at either end a great brick chimney.  From
the porch to the water, a hundred yards away, stretched a walk of
crushed shells bisecting an expanse of green turf dotted with noble
trees—the cedar and the cypress predominating.  Diverging from this
central walk were two narrower paths which, winding in and out in
eccentric figures, led, on the one hand, to a rustic summer-house
overgrown with honeysuckle and trumpet-vine, and on the other to a tiny
grotto constructed of shells and set in a tangle of periwinkle. Along
one side of the house, and protected by a stout locust paling overrun
with grape-vines, lay the garden, where flowers and vegetables
flourished contentedly side by side, the hollyhocks and tall white
lilies, the hundred-leaved roses and scarlet poppies showing like gilded
officers amidst the rank and file of sober essuculents.  Behind the
house were clustered various offices, then came an orchard where the
June apples and the great red cherries were ripening in the hot
sunshine, then on the shore of a second and narrower creek rose the
quarters for the plantation servants, white and black—a long double row
of cabins, dominated by the overseer’s house and shaded by ragged yellow
pines.  Along one shore of this inlet was planted the Indian corn
prescribed by law, and from the other gleamed the soft yellow of
ripening wheat, but beyond the water and away to the westward stretched
acre after acre of tobacco, a sea of vivid green, broken only by an
occasional shed or drying house, and merging at last into the darker hue
of the forest.  Over all the fair scene, the flashing water, the velvet
marshes, the smiling fields, the fringe of dark and mysterious woodland,
hung a Virginia heaven, a cloudless blue, soft, pure, intense.  The air
was full of subdued sound—the distant hum of voices from the fields of
maize and tobacco, the faint clink of iron from the smithy, the wash and
lap of the water, the drone of bees from the hives beneath the eaves of
the house.  Great bronze butterflies fluttered in the sunshine,
brilliant humming-birds, plunged deep into the long trumpet-flowers;
from the topmost bough of a locust, heavy with bloom, came the liquid
trill of a mock bird.

It was a fair domain, and a wealthy.  The Englishman thought of certain
appalling sums lost to Sedley and Roscommon, and there flitted through
his brain a swift little calculation as to the number of hogsheads of
Orenoko or sweet-scented it would take to wipe off the score.  And the
girl beside him was beautiful enough to take Whitehall by storm, to be
berhymed by Waller, and to give to Lely a subject above all flattery.
He set his lips with the air of a man who has made up his mind, and
turned to his companion, who was absorbed in watching the white sail
grow slowly larger.

""How long, now, cousin?""

""But a few minutes unless the wind should fail.""

""And then you will have your treasures.  But, madam, when you have
assumed all the panoply your sex relies on to increase its charms ’t
will be but to ’gild refined gold or paint the lily.’  The Aphrodite of
this western ocean needs no adornment.""

The girl looked at him with laughter in her eyes. ""You make me too many
pretty speeches, cousin,"" she said demurely.  ""We know the value of the
fine things you court gallants are perpetually saying.""

""Upon my soul, madam, I swear""—

""Do you know the amount of the fine for swearing, Sir Charles?  See how
large the sail has grown! When the boat rounds the long marsh she will
come more quickly.  We will soon be able to see my father wave his
handkerchief.""

The young man bit his lip.  ""You are pleased to be cruel to-day, madam,
but I am your slave and I obey.  We will look together for Colonel
Verney’s handkerchief.  How many black slaves does he bring you?""

She laughed.  ""But half a dozen blacks, but there will be several
redemptioners if you prefer to be numbered with them.""

""Redemptioners!  Ah, yes!  the English servants who are sold for their
passage money.  I thank you, madam, but _my_ servitude is for life.""

""The men my father will bring may not be the ordinary servants who come
here to better their condition.  He may have obtained them from a batch
of felons from Newgate who have been kept in gaol in Jamestown until
word could be got to the planters around.  I am sure I wish the ship
captains and the traders would stop bringing in the wretches.  It is
different with the negroes: we can make allowance for the poor silly
things that are scarce more than animals, and they grow attached to us
and we to them, and the simple indented servants are well enough too.
There are among them many honest and intelligent men.  But these gaol
birds are dreadful.  It sickens me to look at them.  Thieves and
murderers every one!""

""I should not think the colony served by their importation.""

""It is not indeed, and we have hopes that it will cease.  I beg my
father not to buy them, but he says that one man cannot stop an
abuse—that as long as his fellow-planters use them he might as well do
so too.""

Sir Charles Carew delicately smothered a yawn. ""The ship that brought me
over a fortnight ago,"" he said lazily, ""had a consignment of such
rascals.  It was amusing to watch their antics, crowded together as they
were in the hold.  There were two wild Irishmen whom we used to have on
deck to dance for us. Gad!  what figures they cut!  The captain and I
had a standing wager of five of the new guineas as to which of the
rascals could hold out longest, promising a measure of rum to the
victorious votary of Terpsichore. When I had lost a score of guineas I
found that the captain was in the habit of priming his man before he
came upon deck.  Naturally, being filled with Dutch courage, he won.""

""Poor Sir Charles!  What did you do?""

""Sent the captain a cartel and fought him on his own deck.  There was
one man in the villainous company whom, I protest, I almost pitied,
though of course the rogue had but his deserts.""

""What was he?""

""A man of about thirty.  A fellow with a handsome face and a lithe
well-made figure which he managed with some grace.  He had the air of
one who had seen better days.  I remember, one day when the captain was
bestowing upon him some especially choice oaths, seeing him clap his
hand to his side as though he expected to touch a rapier hilt.  He was
cleanly too; kept his rags of clothing as decent as circumstances
allowed, and looked less like a wild beast in a litter of foul straw
than did his fellows.  But he was an ill-conditioned dog.  We had some
passages together, he and I.  He took it upon himself to defend what he
was pleased to call the honor of one of his precious company.  It was
vastly amusing....  After that I fell into the habit of watching him
through the open hatches.  A little thing provides entertainment at sea,
Mistress Patricia.  He would sit or stand for hours looking past me with
a perfectly still face. The other wretches were quick to crowd up,
whining to me to pitch them half pence or tobacco, but try as I would, I
could not get word or look from him. Sink me!  if he did n’t have the
impudence to resent my being there!""

""It was cruel to stare at misery.""

""Lard, madam!  such vermin are used to being stared at.  In London,
Newgate, and Bridewell are theatres as well as the Cockpit or the King’s
House, and the world of mode flock to the one spectacle as often as to
the other.  But see!  the sloop has passed the marsh and has a clean
sweep of water between her and the wharf.""

""Yes, she is coming fast now.""

""What is coming?"" asked a voice from the doorway.

""The Flying Patty, Aunt Lettice,"" the girl answered over her shoulder.
""Get your hood and come with us to the wharf.""

Mistress Lettice Verney emerged from the hall, two red spots burning in
her withered cheeks, and her tall thin figure quivering with excitement.

""I am all ready, child,"" she quavered.  ""But, mark my words, Patricia,
there will be something wrong with my paduasoy petticoat, or Charette
will not have sent the proper tale of green stockings or Holland smocks.
Did you not hear the screech owl last night?""

""No, Aunt Lettice.""

""It remained beneath my window the entire night. I did not sleep a wink.
And this morning Chloe upset the salt cellar, and the salt fell towards
me.""  Mistress Lettice rolled her eyes heavenward and sighed
lugubriously.  Patricia laughed.

""I dreamed of flowers last night, Aunt Lettice; miles and miles of them,
waxen and cold and sweet, like those they strew over the dead.""

Mistress Lettice groaned.  ""’T is a dreadful sign. Captain Norton’s wife
(she that was Polly Wilson) dreamed of flowers the night before the
massacre of ’forty-four.  The only thing the poor soul said when the
warwhoop wakened them in the dead of the night and the door came
crashing in, was, ’I told you so.’  They were her last words.  Then
Martha Westall dreamed of flowers, and two days later her son James
stepped on a stingray over at Dale’s Gift.  And I myself dreamed of
roses the week before those horrid Roundhead commissioners with the
rebel Claiborne at their head and a whole fleet at their back, compelled
us to surrender to their odious Commonwealth.""

""At least that evil is past,"" said the girl with a gay laugh.  ""And ill
fortune will never come to me aboard the Flying Patty, so I shall go
down to the wharf to see her in.  Darkeih!  my scarf!""

A negress appeared in the doorway with a veil of tissue in her hand.
Sir Charles took it from her and flung it over Patricia’s golden head,
then offered his arm to Mistress Lettice.

The wharf was but a stone’s throw from the wooden gates, and they were
soon treading the long stretch of gray, weather-beaten boards.  Others
were before them, for the news that the sloop was coming in had drawn a
small crowd to the wharf to welcome the master.

The dozen or so of boatmen, white and black, who had been tinkering
about in the various barges, shallops and canoes tied to the mossy
piles, left their employments and scrambled up upon the platform, and a
trio of youthful darkies, fishing for crabs with a string and a piece of
salt pork, allowed their lines to fall slack and their intended victims
to walk coolly off with the meat, so intense was their interest in the
oncoming sail.  A knot of negro women had left the great house kitchen
and stood, hands on hips, chatting volubly with a contingent from the
quarters, their red and yellow turbans nodding up and down like
grotesque Dutch tulips.  The company was made up by an overseer with a
broadleafed palmetto hat pulled down over his eyes and a clay pipe stuck
between his teeth, a pale young man who acted as secretary to the master
of the plantation, and by three or four small land-owners and tenants
for whom Colonel Verney had graciously undertaken various commissions in
Jamestown, and who were on hand to make their acknowledgments to the
great man.

They all made deferential way for the two ladies and Sir Charles Carew.
Mistress Lettice commenced a condescending conversation with one of the
tenants, Darkeih added a white tulip to the red and yellow ones, and
Patricia, followed by Sir Charles, walked to the edge of the wharf, and
leaning upon the rude railing looked down the glassy reaches of the
water to the approaching boat.

The wind had sunk into a fitful breeze and the white sail moved very
slowly.  The tide was in, and the water lapped with a cooling sound
against the dark green piles.  In the distance the blue of the bay
melted into the blue of the sky, while the nearer waters mirrored every
passing gull, the masts of the fishing boats, the tall marsh grass, the
dead twigs marking oyster beds—each object had its double. On a point of
marshy ground stood a line of cranes, motionless as soldiers on parade,
until, taking fright as the great sail glided past, they whirred off,
uttering discordant cries and with their legs sticking out like tail
feathers.  Slowly, and keeping to the middle of the channel, the boat
came on.  Upon the long low deck men were preparing to lower the sail,
and a portly gentleman standing in the bow was vigorously waving his
handkerchief.  The sail came down with a rush, the anchor swung
overboard, and half a dozen canoes and dugouts shot from under the
shadow of the wharf and across the strip of water between it and the
sloop.  The gentleman with the handkerchief, followed by a man plainly
dressed in brown, sprang into the foremost; the others waited for their
lading of merchandise.

Before the boat had touched the steps the master of the plantation began
to call out greetings to his expectant family.

""Patricia, my darling, are you in health?  Charles, I am happy to see
you again!  Sister Lettice, Mr. Frederick Jones sends you his humble
services.""

""La, brother!  and how is the dear man?"" screamed Mistress Lettice.

""As well as’t is in nature to be, with his heart at Verney Manor and his
body at Flowerdieu Hundred.""

The boat jarred against the piles and the planter stepped out, grasping
Sir Charles’s extended hand.

""Again, I am happy to see you, Charles,"" he cried in a round and jovial
voice.  ""I have been telling my up-river good friends that I have the
most topping fellow in all London for my guest, and you will have
company enough anon.""

Sir Charles smiled and bowed.  ""I hope, sir, that you were successful in
the business that took you to Jamestown?""

""Fairly so, fairly so.  Haines here,"" with a wave of the hand towards
the man in brown, ""had a lot picked out for me to choose from.  I have
six negroes and three of those blackguards from Newgate—mighty poor
policy to shoulder ourselves with such gaol sweepings.  I doubt we ’ll
repent it some day. The blacks come by way of Boston, which means that
they will have to be cockered up considerably before they are fit for
work.  Is that you, Woodson? How have things gone on?""

The overseer took his pipe from between his teeth and made an awkward
bow.

""Glad to see your Honor back,"" he said deferentially. ""Everything ’s all
right, sir.  The last rain helped the corn amazingly, and the tobacco ’s
prime. The lightning struck a shed, but we got the flames out before
they reached the hogsheads.  The Nancy got caught in a squall; lost both
masts and ran aground on Gull Marsh.  The tide will take her off at the
full of the moon.  Sambo ’s been playing ’possum again.  Said he ’d cut
his foot with his hoe so badly that he could n’t stand upon it.  Said I
could see that by the blood on the rag that tied it up.  I made him take
off the rag and wash the foot, and there wa’n’t no cut there.  The blood
was puccoon.  If he ’d waited a bit he could ’a’ had all he wanted to
paint with, for I gave him the rope’s end lively, until Mistress
Patricia heard him yelling and made me stop.""

""All right, Woodson.  I reckon the plantation knows by this time that
what Mistress Patricia says is law.  Here come the boats with the boxes.
Tell the men to be careful how they handle them.""

After a hearty word or two to tenants and land owners the worthy Colonel
joined his daughter and sister; and together with Sir Charles Carew they
watched the precious boxes conveyed up the slippery steps, the overseer
shouting directions, plentifully sprinkled with selected, unfinable
oaths to the panting boatmen.  When all were safely piled upon the wharf
ready to be wheeled to the great house, the empty boats swung off to
make room for others, laden with the colonel’s Jamestown purchases.

One by one the articles climbed the stairs, each as it reached the level
being claimed by the overseer and told off into a lengthening line.  Six
were negroes, gaunt and hollow-eyed, but smiling widely. They gazed
around them, at the heap of clams and oysters piled upon the wharf, at
the marshes, alive with wild fowl, at the distant green of waving corn,
the flower-embowered great house, the white quarters from which arose
many little spirals of savory smoke, and a bland and child-like content
took possession of their souls.  With eager and obsequious ""Yes Mas’rs""
they obeyed the overseer’s objurgatory indications as to their
disposition.

There next arose above the landing the head of a white man—a countenance
of sullen ferocity, with a great scar running across it, and framed in
elf locks of staring red.  The body belonging to this prepossessing face
was swollen and unshapely, and its owner moved with a limp and a
muttered curse towards the place assigned him.  He was followed by a
sallow-faced, long-nosed man, with black oily hair and an affected smirk
which twitched the corners of his thin lips.  Singling out his master’s
family with a furtive glance from a pair of sinister greenish eyes, he
made a low bow and stepped jauntily into line.

The third man rose above the landing.  Sir Charles, standing by
Patricia, laughed.

""This world is a place of fantastic meetings, cousin,"" he said, airily.
""Now who would suppose that I would ever again see that chipping from a
London gaol I told you of—my shipmate of cleanly habit and unsocial
nature.  Yet there he is.""




                              *CHAPTER II*

                              *ITS CARGO*


The afternoon sunshine lay hot upon the house and garden of Verney
Manor—the leaves drooped motionless, the glare of the white paths hurt
the eye, the flowers seemed all to  be red.  The odor of rose and
honeysuckle was drowned in the heavy cloying sweetness of the pendant
masses of locust bloom. Down in the garden the bees droned in the vines,
and on the steps the flies buzzed undisturbed about the sleeping hounds.
Above the long, deserted wharf and the green velvet of the marshes
quivered the heated air, while to look upon the water was like gazing
too closely at blue flame.  From the tobacco fields floated the notes of
a monotonous many-versed chant, and a soft, uninterrupted cooing came
from the dove cot.  Heat and fragrance and drowsy sound combined to give
a pleasant somnolence to the wide sunny scene.

Deep in the cavernous shade of the porch lounged the master of the
plantation, his body in one chair, his legs in another, and a silver
tankard of sack standing upon a third, over the back of which had been
flung his great peruke and his riding coat of green cloth, discarded
because of the heat.  Thin, blue clouds curled up from his long pipe,
and obscured his ruddy countenance.

His shrewd gray eyes under their tufts of grizzled hair were half closed
in a lazy contentment, born of the hour, the pipe, and the drink.  The
world went very well just then in Colonel Verney’s estimation. His crop
of the preceding year had been a large and profitable one: this year it
bid fair to be still more satisfactory.  During the past few months he
had acquired a number of servants and slaves, and his head rights would
add a goodly number of acres to his already enormous holdings; land,
land, always more land! being the ambition and the necessity of the
seventeenth century Virginia planter.  Trader, planter, magistrate,
member of the council of state, soldier, author on occasion, and fine
gentleman all rolled into one, after the fashion of the times; Cavalier
of the Cavaliers, hand in glove with Governor Berkeley, and possessed of
a beautiful daughter, for whose favor one half of the young gentlemen of
the counties of York and Gloucester were ready to draw rapier on the
other half,—Colonel Verney’s world was a fair and stirring one, and gave
him plentiful food for meditation on a fine afternoon.

Opposite him sat his kinsman and guest, Sir Charles Carew.  He was
similarly equipped with pipe and sack, but there the resemblance to his
host ended, Sir Charles Carew being a man who made it a point of honor
to be clad like the lilies of the field on every possible occasion in
life, from the carrying a breach to the ogling a milkmaid.  The sultry
afternoon had no power to affect the scrupulous elegance of his attire,
or to alter the careful repose of his manner. In his hand he held a
volume of ""Hudibras,"" but his thoughts were not upon the book, wandering
instead, with those of his kinsman, over the fertile fields of Verney
Manor.

""You have a princely estate, sir, in this fair, new world,"" he said at
last, in a sweetly languid voice.

The planter roused himself from considering at what point of his newly
acquired land he should begin the attack upon the forest.  ""It ’s a fair
enough home for a man to end his days in,"" he said with complacence.

""We of the court have very erroneous ideas as to Virginia.  I confess
that my expectation of finding a courteous and loving kinsman,"" a
gracious smile and inclination of the head towards the older man, ""is
the only one in which I have not been disappointed. I thought to see a
rude wilderness, and I find, to borrow the language of our Roundhead
friends, a very land of Beulah.""

""Ay, ay.  D’ ye remember what old Drayton sings?

    ’Virginia!
    Earth’s only paradise!’

And a paradise it is, with mighty few drawbacks, now that the King has
come to his own again, if you except these d—d canting Quakers and
Anabaptists, and those yelling red devils on the frontier, and the
danger of a servant insurrection, and the fact that his Majesty (God
bless him!) and the Privy Council fleece us more mercilessly than did
old Noll himself. I verily think they believe our tobacco plants made of
gold like those they say Pizarro saw in Peru.  But ’tis a sweet land!
Why, look around you!"" he cried, warming to his subject.  ""The waters
swarm with fish, the marshes with wild fowl.  In the winter the air
rings with the _cohonk! cohonk!_ of the wild geese. They darken the air
when they come and go.  There in the forest stand the deer, waiting for
your bullet; badgers and foxes, bears, wolves, and catamounts are more
plentiful than are hares in England.  You taste pleasure indeed when you
ride full tilt through the frosty moonlight, down the ringing glades of
the forest, and hear the hounds in full cry, and see before you, black
against the silver snow, a pack of yelling wolves. Then in summer the
woods are full of singing birds and of such flowers as you in England
only dream of. Strawberries make the ground red, and there are wild
melons and grapes and mulberries, and more nuts than squirrels, which is
saying much for the nuts. Everything grows here.  ’T is the garden of
the world.  And what is there fairer than the green of the tobacco and
the golden corn tassels?  And the noble rivers, whose head waters no man
has ever found, hidden by the Lord in the Blue Mountains near to the
South Sea!  Sir, Virginia is God’s country!""

""You in these lowlands have no trouble with the Indians?""

""None to speak of since ’forty-four, when Opechancanough came down upon
us.  The brush with the Ricahecrians seven years ago was nothing.  They
are utterly broken, both here and in Accomac. Further up the rivers the
devil still holds his own, we hearing doleful tales of the butchery of
pioneers with their wives and children; and above the falls of the far
west, in the Monacan country, and towards the Blue Mountains, is his
stronghold and capitol; but here in the lowlands all’s safe enough.
There is no fear of the savages.  Would we could say as much of the
servants!""

""Why, what do you fear from them?""

""It ’s hard to say; but an uneasy feeling has prevailed for a year or
more.  It’s this d—d Oliverian element among them.  You see, ever since
his Majesty’s blessed restoration, gang after gang of rebels have been
sent us—Independents, Muggletonians, Fifth Monarchy men, dour Scotch
Whigamores—dangerous fanatics all!  Many are Naseby or Worcester rogues,
Ironsides who worship the memory of that devil’s lieutenant, Oliver.
All have the gift of the gab.  We disperse them as much as possible, not
allowing above five or six to any one plantation, we of the Council
realizing that they form a dangerous leaven.  Should there be trouble,
which heaven forbid! they would be the instigators, restless
mischief-makers and overturners of the established order of things that
they are!  Then there are their fellow criminals, the highwaymen,
forgers, cutpurses and bullies of whom we relieve his Majesty’s
government. They are few in number, but each is a very plague spot,
infecting honester men.  The slaves, always excepting the Portuguese and
Spanish mulattoes from the Indies, who are devils incarnate, have not
brain enough to conspire.  But in the actual event of a rising they
would be fiends unchained.""

""A pleasant state of affairs!""

""Oh, it is not so serious!  We who govern the Colony have to take all
possibilities, however unpleasant, into consideration.  I myself do not
think the danger imminent, and many in the Council and among the
Burgesses, and well-nigh all outside will not allow that there is danger
at all.  We passed more stringent servant laws last year, and we depend
upon them, and upon the great body of indented servants, who are, for
the most part, honest and amenable and know upon which side their bread
is buttered, to repress the unruly element.""

""What will you do with the convicts you brought with you this morning?""

""Use them in the tobacco fields just now when all hands are needed to
weed and sucker the plants, and afterwards put them to hewing down the
forest.  I told Woodson to bring them around to me this afternoon when
they had been decently clothed.  I always give the scoundrels a piece of
my mind to begin with. It saves trouble.""

""Do they give you much trouble?""

""Not on this plantation.  Woodson and Haines are excellent overseers.""

The planter refilled his pipe, struck a light with his flint and steel,
and leaning back amidst the fragrant clouds, allowed his eyelids to
droop and his mind to wander over a pleasant sunshiny tract of nothing
in particular.

Sir Charles tasted his sack, adjusted his ruffles, and resumed his
reading.  But even the delectable adventures of the Presbyterian knight,
over whom all London was laughing, palled on such an afternoon, and the
young gentleman, after listlessly turning a page or two, laid the book
across his knee, and with closed eyes commenced the construction of an
air castle of his own.

He was roused by the sound of approaching footsteps upon the shell path
leading to the back of the house, and by the harsh voice of the
overseer.

""Here come your hopeful purchases, sir,"" he said lazily.

The overseer turned the corner of the house and came forward with the
three convicts at his heels. He doffed his hat to the two gentlemen,
then turned to his charges.  ""Fall into line, you dogs, and salute his
Honor!""

The first man, he of the long nose and the twitching lip, smiled
sweetly, and bent so low that his fell of greasy hair well-nigh swept
the steps; the second, with a brow like a thunder cloud, gave a vicious
nod; the third, with as impassive a countenance as Sir Charles’s own,
bowed gravely, and stood with folded arms and a quietly attentive mien.

The planter gathered himself up from his chair and came forward to the
top of the steps, his tall, corpulent figure towering above the men
below much as his fortunes towered above theirs.

""Now, men,"" he said, speaking sternly and with slow emphasis.  ""I have
just one word to say to you. Listen well to it.  I am your master; you
are my servants.  I reckon myself a good master, it not being my way to
treat those belonging to me, whether white or black, like dumb beasts.
Give me obedience and the faithful work of your hands, and you shall
find me kind.  But if you are stubborn or rebellious, by the Lord, you
will rue the day you left Newgate!  Whipping-post and branding-irons are
at hand, and death is something closer to a felon in Virginia than in
England.  Be careful!  Now, Woodson, what have you put these men to?""

""They ’ll go into the three-mile field to-morrow morning, your honor,
unless you wish other disposition made of them.""

""No, that will do.  Take them away.""

The overseer faced about and was marching off with the recruits for the
three-mile field when his master’s voice arrested him.

""Take those two in front on with you, Woodson, and send me back the
brown-haired one.""

The ""brown-haired one"" turned as his companions disappeared around a
hedge of privet and came slowly back to the steps.

""You wished to speak to me, sir?"" he said quietly.

""Yes.  You are the man who was tolerably helpful in the squall last
night?""

""I was so fortunate as to be of some small service, sir.""

""You understand the handling of a boat?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Hum.  I will tell Woodson to try you with a sloop when the press of
work in the fields is past. What is your name?""

""Godfrey Landless.""

""Chevalier d’Industrie and frequenter of the Newgate Ordinary,"" put in
Sir Charles lazily.  ""Of the Roundhead persuasion too, if I mistake
not,—from robbery in the large, descended to thievery in the small; from
the murder of a King to knives and a black alley mouth.  Commend me to
these grave rogues for real knaves!  Pray inform us to what little
mishap we owe the honor of your company.  Did you mercifully incline to
relieve weary travelers over Hounslow Heath by disburdening them of
their heavy purses?  Or did you mistake your own handwriting for that of
some one else?  Or did you woo a mercer’s wife a thought too roughly?
Or perhaps—""

The man shot a fiery upward glance at the slim, elegant figure and
mocking lips of his tormentor, but kept silence.  Colonel Verney, who
had returned to his pipe, interposed.  ""What is all this, Charles? What
are you saying to the man?""

""Oh, nothing, sir!  This gentleman and I were shipmates, and I did but
ask after his health since the voyage.""

""Sir Charles Carew is very good,"" the man said proudly.  ""I assure him
that the object of his solicitude is well, and only desires an
opportunity to repay, with interest, those little attentions shown him
by his courteous fellow voyager.""

The planter looked puzzled: Sir Charles laughed.

""Our liking is mutual, I see,"" he said coolly.  ""I—but what is this,
Colonel Verney!  Venus descending from Olympus?""

Out of the doorway fluttered a brilliant vision, all blue and white like
the great butterflies hovering over the clove pinks.  Behind it appeared
the faded countenance of Mrs. Lettice, and a group of turbaned heads
peered, grinning, from out the cool darkness of the hall.

""Papa!"" cried the vision.  ""I want to show you my new dress!  Cousin
Charles, you are to tell me if it is all as it should be!""

Sir Charles bowed, with his hand upon his heart. ""Alas, madam!  I could
as soon play critic to the choir of angels.  My eyes are dazzled.""

""Stand out, child,"" said her father gazing at her with eyes of love and
pride, ""and let us see your finery.  D’ ye know what the extravagant
minx has upon her back, Charles?  Just five hogsheads of prime tobacco!""

Mistress Lettice struck in: ""Well, I ’m sure, brother, ’t is much the
prettiest use to put tobacco to, to turn it into lace and brocade and
jewels,—much better, say I, than to be forever using it to accumulate
filthy slaves.""

Patricia floated to the centre of the porch and stood sunning herself in
a stray shaft of light, like a very bird of paradise.  The ""tempestuous
petticoat,"" sky-blue and laced with silver, swelled proudly outwards,
the gleaming satin bodice slipped low over the snowy shoulders and the
heaving bosom, and the sleeves, trimmed with magnificent lace and looped
with pearls, showed the rounded arms to perfection.  Around the slender
throat was wound a double row of pearls, and the golden ringlets were
partially confined by a snood of blue velvet.  She unfurled a wonderful
fan, and lifted her skirts to show the tiny white and silver shoes and
the silken silver-clocked ankles.  Her eyes shone like stars, faint wild
roses bloomed in her cheeks, charming half smiles chased each other
across her dainty mouth. Such a picture of radiant youth and loveliness
did she present that the Englishman’s pulses quickened, and he swore
under his breath.  ""Surely,"" he muttered, ""this is the most beautiful
woman in the world, and my lucky stars have sent me to this No Man’s
Land to win her.""

""How do you like me?"" she cried gayly.  ""Is’t not worth the five
hogsheads?""

Her father drew her to him and kissed the smooth forehead.

""You look just as your mother did, child, the day that we were
betrothed.  I could not give you higher praise than that, sweetheart.""

""And does it really lack nothing, cousin?"" she cried anxiously.  ""Is it
in truth such a dress as they wear at Court?""

""Not at Whitehall, madam, nor at Brussels, nor even at St. Germains have
I seen anything more point device than the dress,—nor as beautiful as
the wearer,"" he added in a lower voice and with a lulling look.

The girl’s face dimpled with pleasure and innocent, gratified vanity.
She swept him a magnificent courtesy, and he bent low over the slender
fingers she gave him.  Suddenly he felt them stiffen in his clasp, and
looking up, saw a curious expression of fear and aversion pass like a
shadow across her face.  She spoke abruptly.  ""That man!  I did not see
him! What does he here?""

Sir Charles wheeled.  The convict, forgotten by the two gentlemen, had
been left standing at the foot of the steps, and his sombre eyes were
now fixed upon the girl in a look so strange and intent as fully to
explain her perturbation.  Through his parted lips the breath came
hurriedly, in his eyes was a mournful exaltation as of one who looks
from a desert into Paradise.  He stood absorbed, unconscious of aught
save the splendid vision above him.  For a moment she stared at him in
return, her eyes, held by his, slowly widening and the color quite gone
from her face.  With a slow, involuntary movement one white arm rose,
and stiffened before her in a gesture of repulsion.  The fan fell from
her hand upon the floor with a click of breaking tortoise shell.  The
sound broke the spell, and with a strong shudder she turned her eyes
away.  ""Make him go,"" she said in a trembling voice.  ""He frightens me.""

Sir Charles sprang forward with an oath.  ""Curse you, you dog!  Take
your ill-omened eyes from the lady!  Colonel Verney, do you not see that
the fellow is annoying your daughter?""

The planter had fallen into a reverie born of recollections of the
Patricia of his youth, long laid in her grave, but he roused himself at
the words of his guest.

""What’s that?"" he cried.  ""Annoying Patricia!"" He walked to the head of
the steps and raised his cane threateningly.

""Hark ye, sirrah!  The servants of Verney Manor, white or black, felon
or indented, need all their eyesight for their work.  They have none to
waste in idle gazing at their betters.  Begone to your mates!""

The man who, at Sir Charles’s intervention, had started as from a dream,
colored deeply and compressed his lips, then glanced from one to the
other of the group above him.  There was pain, humiliation, almost
supplication in the look which he directed to the girl who had brought
this rating upon him.  He glanced at his master with a countenance
studiously devoid of expression, at Mistress Lettice with indifference,
at Sir Charles Carew with chill defiance.  Then, with a grave
inclination of his head, he turned, and a moment later had disappeared
behind the hedge.




                             *CHAPTER III*

                       *A COLONIAL DINNER PARTY*


Three days later the master of Verney Manor gave a dinner party.

At Jamestown, twenty miles away, the Assembly had just adjourned after a
busy session.  A law debarring that ""turbulent people"" the Quakers from
further admittance into the colony, and providing cold comfort for those
already within its doors, was passed with acclamation, as was another
against Anabaptists, and a third concerning the hue and cry for
absconding servants and slaves.  The selling rates for wines and strong
waters were fixed, a proper penalty attached to the planting of tobacco
contrary to the statute, a regulation for the mending of the highways
adopted, a fine imposed for non-attendance at church, the Navigation Act
formally protested against, the trainbands strengthened, an
appropriation made for the erection of new whipping-posts and pillories,
a cruel mistress deprived of the slave she had mistreated, a harborer of
schismatics publicly reproved, and a conciliatory message and present
sent to the up-river Indians—when the Assembly adjourned with the
consciousness of having nobly done its duty.  The only measure upon
which there was not unanimity of opinion was one proposing the erection
of schoolhouses at convenient cross-roads, and the Governor’s weight
being thrown into the balance against it, it was promptly quashed.

The burgesses from the fourteen counties filled the twenty houses that
constituted the town to suffocation. Up-river planters, too, had come
in, choosing the time the Assembly was in session to attend to their
interests in the ""city.""  Several ships were in harbor, and their
captains, professing themselves tired of salt water, threw themselves
upon the hospitality of their friends ashore.  The crowded population
overflowed into the houses of the neighboring planters, who, after the
manner of their kind, entertained profusely, giving jovial welcome and
good liquor to all comers.  There was a constant jingling of reins along
the bridle paths, a constant passing of white-sailed sloops upon the
river, as gentlemen in riding coats and jack boots, or in laced coats
and silk stockings, fared to and fro between plantation and town.  In
the intervals of business the worthy burgesses and their fellow planters
made merry.  They were good times—for king’s men—and it behooved every
loyal subject to follow (at a respectful distance) his Majesty’s
example, and get all possible enjoyment from a laughing world.  So there
were horse-races and cock-fights and bear-baitings, as well as dinners
and suppers, at which much sack and aqua vitæ was drunk to king, church,
and reigning beauties.  And if a quarrel sprung, full armed, from the
heated brains of young gallants, crossed rapiers did but add a piquancy,
a dash of cayenne, to life.

Popular with the elder gentlemen because of his excellent Madeira, quick
wit, jovial soul, and friendship with the Governor, and with the younger
by virtue of being father to Mistress Patricia Verney, Colonel Richard
Verney had no difficulty in securing a score of guests for a day’s
entertainment at Verney Manor.

About ten in the morning of the appointed day the guests began to
arrive, some by water, some on horseback, Colonel Verney meeting each
arrival with a stately bow and a high-flown speech of welcome, and
handing him on to the hall where stood Sir Charles Carew and the ladies
of the household.

Upon a pillion behind her father, Major Miles Carrington,
Surveyor-General to the Colony, came Mistress Betty Carrington, bosom
friend to Mistress Patricia Verney.  Her sweetly serious face, pensive
eyes, and smooth, dark hair, with her dress of sober silk and kerchief
of finest lawn, demurely crossed over her bosom, contrasted finely with
Patricia’s radiant beauty, decked in shimmering satin and rich lace, and
heightened by a tinge of vermilion upon the smooth cheek, and a long
black patch beneath the left temple.  The two met like friends whom
weary years have parted, and indeed they had not seen each other for
nearly a week.

All the guests, save one, had arrived.  Colonel Verney fidgeted, sent a
servant wench to look at the kitchen clock, and dispatched his secretary
to an upstairs window, whence was visible a long stretch of what
courtesy called the highroad.

The secretary returned and whispered his master. ""God be thanked!""
exclaimed the latter.  ""I feared that his machine had mired in the
Two-Mile Swamp, or had toppled into a gully coming through the Devil’s
Strip.  Gentlemen, the Governor’s coach is in sight. Shall we adjourn to
the porch and there await his Excellency?""

A mighty straining, jingling and lumbering came with the breeze down the
road and proceeded from a pillar of dust which was approaching the house
with reasonable rapidity.  Presently the road changed from a trough of
dust into a ribbon of greensward. The cloud dissipated itself, streaming
away like the tail of a comet, and a ponderous and much begilt coach,
drawn by six horses, their manes and tails tied with red ribbons, and
outriders in gorgeous livery at the heads of each pair, rolled, or
rather bumped into sight.  With a seasick motion it undulated over the
green acclivities of the road, and finally drew up beside the great
horse-block at the gate.

Two lackeys sprang from their perch behind the vehicle, flung open the
door, and lowered a short flight of steps.  A very stately gentleman,
richly dressed, with a handkerchief of point in one hand and a jeweled
snuff-box in the other, descended the steps, placing one shapely leg in
its maroon-colored stocking before the other with the mannered grace of
the leader of a Coranto.

Colonel Verney met him with a low bow and smiling face, after which the
two embraced, for they were old friends.

""My dear Governor!""

""My dear Colonel!""

""I am charmed to welcome your Excellency to my poor house.""

""My dear Colonel, I am charmed to be here.  Gad! the possession of the
only chariot in the Colony is a burdensome honor!  I thought dinner
would be over, and the stirrup cup in order while I was creeping, like a
snail with his house on his back, over these ’fair and pleasant
roads’—as I call them in my book, eh, Dick!  But you have a goodly
company, I see; Ludwell, Fitzhugh, Carey, Anthony Nash, mine ancient
enemy Lawrence, Wormeley, Carrington our Puritan convert and his pretty
daughter, young Peyton, and that pretty fellow, your nephew or cousin,
is he? Odzooks! he is much what I was at his age, begotten of Delilah
and Lucifer, hand of iron in glove of velvet, eh, Dick!  I hear he is
hail-fellow-well-met with the King and with Buckingham and Killigrew and
their wild set.  Ah, boys will be boys!  ’We have heard the chimes at
midnight,’ eh, Dick?""

And the Governor in high good humor skipped up the steps with the
agility of youth, bent low with sugared compliments over the hands of
his hostesses and of Mistress Betty Carrington, and gave courteous
greeting to the assembled gentlemen, after which the company flowed back
into the grateful twilight of hall and ""great room,"" where the weather,
the state of the crops, and the last horse-race engaged them until the
announcement of dinner.

With a flourish of his costly handkerchief, the Governor offered his arm
to the young mistress of the house, and led the way to the dining-room,
where old Humfrey, the butler, marshaled the guests to their seats.
Mistress Betty Carrington had for her cavalier Sir Charles Carew, to
whose honeyed words she listened with a species of awe, wondering in her
innocent soul if all the wild tales they told of this very fine,
smooth-tongued, handsome gentleman could be true.

Doctor Anthony Nash made a long and fluent grace wherein much latinity
was aired, a neat allusion made to the _jus divinum_, and an anathema
hurled against those ""who break down the carved work of the sanctuary.""
Then was uncovered the mighty saddle of mutton, reposing in the dish of
honor, the roast pig, the haunch of venison, the sirloin of beef, the
breast of veal, the powdered goose, the noble dish of sheeps-head and
bluefish, and the pasty in which was entombed a whole flock of pigeons.
These _pièces de resistance_ were flanked by bowls of oysters, by rows
of wild fowl skewered together, by mince pies and a grand salad, while
upon the outskirts of the damask plain were stationed trenchers piled
with wheat bread, platters of pease and smoking potatoes, cauliflower
and asparagus, and a concoction of rice and prunes, seasoned with mace
and cinnamon and a pinch of assafœtida.  A great silver salt-cellar
stood in the centre of the table, and smaller receptacles of the same
metal held pepper and spices.  Silver flagons of cider and ale were
placed at intervals, the Madeira, Fayal and Rhenish awaiting upon the
sideboard the moment when, the cloth drawn and the ladies gone, a
gentlemanly carousal should be inaugurated.

The company drew their Russian leather chairs closer to the table,
spread over their silken knees the fringed damask napkins, and for a
space little was to be heard but the sound of knife and spoon (forks
there were none), for the morning ride had sharpened appetites.  The
servants passed from chair to chair; the master, seconded by his
daughter and sister, pricked his guests on to fresh attacks, pressing a
third slice of mutton on one, a fresh helping of capon upon another,
protesting that a third ate as though it were a fast day, and that a
fourth drank as though the October were sea-water.

When the cloth was drawn and the banquet put on, tongues were loosened.
The Governor quoted passages from his ""Lost Lady"" to Patricia, lifting
her lovely flushed face from the carving of a tart with wonderfully
constructed towering walls.  Behind a second turreted marvel of pastry,
Mistress Lettice and Mr. Frederick Jones sighed and ogled with antique
grace.  Sir Charles Carew, fingering his cherries, told a piquant little
court anecdote to Mistress Betty Carrington, and was lazily amused at
the blush and veiled eyelids with which the young lady received it.
Young Mr. Peyton, on her other side, looked very black.

The wine was put on and the toast to King and Church drunk standing,
after which the ladies dipped their white fingers into the basin of
perfumed water, dried them on the silver-fringed napkin, and sailed to
the door, through which, after the profoundest of courtesies on the one
side and the lowest of bows upon the other, they vanished, leaving the
gentlemen to wine and wassail.

Colonel Verney drank to the Governor; the Governor to Colonel Verney;
Sir Charles to the author of the ""Lost Lady"" and the ""Discourse and View
of Virginia,"" so tickling the Governor’s vanity thereby that he became
altogether charming. Mr. Peyton toasted Mistress Betty Carrington, and
Mr. Frederick Jones, Mistress Lettice Verney, ""fairest and most discreet
of ladies.""  They drank to Captain Laramore’s next voyage, to Mr.
Wormeley’s success in vine planting, to Major Carrington’s conversion.
They drank confusion to Quakers, Independents, Baptists and infidels, to
the heathen on the frontier and the Papists in Maryland, the Dutch on
the Hudson and the French on the St. Lawrence,—""Quebec in exchange for
Dunkirk!""  In short, there were few things in heaven or earth but
justified draughts of Madeira.

The room filled with a blue and fragrant mist proceeding from twenty
pipe-bowls.  Mr. Peyton sang a pretty song of his own composing.  The
company applauded.  Sir Charles Carew, in a richly plaintive tenor
voice, sang a lyric of Rochester’s.  Several of the gentlemen looked
askance (the clergyman had left the room with the ladies), but on the
Governor’s crying out ""Excellent!"" they considered themselves
over-squeamish, and clapped loudly.

Sir Charles, being dry after his song, drank to Hospitality,—""A duty,""
he said, smiling, ""that you gentlemen make so paramount that you must
wonder at the omission of ’Thou shalt be hospitable’ from the
Decalogue.""

""Faith, sir!"" cried Mr. Peyton, ""God is too good a Virginian not to
consider such a commandment superfluous.""

The Governor commenced a story which all present, but one, had heard a
dozen times.  It mattered the less, as it was a good one.  Sir Charles
capped it with a better.  The Governor told a weird tale of Lunsford’s
men, the ""babe-eating"" regiment.  Sir Charles recounted a little
adventure of His Grace of Buckingham with a quack astrologer, a Court
lady, and an orange girl, which made the company die of laughter.

""Rat me! but you tell a story well, sir!"" said the Governor, wiping his
eyes.

""I serve King Charles the Second, your Excellency.""

""And so have to live by your wit, eh, sir?""

""Precisely, your Excellency.""

""Emigrate to Virginia, man! to the land of good eating, good drinking,
good fighting, stout men, and pretty women—who make angelic wives.""  And
the Governor, who loved his own wife with chivalric devotion, kissed a
locket which he wore at his neck. ""Come to Virginia where we need loyal
men and true.  Lord! we all thought the millennium was come with the
king, but damme! if it doesn’t seem as far off as ever!  Not that his
Majesty is to blame,"" he added quickly, as though fearing that his words
might be taken as an aspersion upon Charles’s ability to conduct the
millennium single-handed.  ""The naughty spirit of the age sets itself
against the Lord’s Anointed.  The Puritan snake is but scotched, not
killed. It’s the old prate of freedom of conscience, government by the
people, and the like disgusting stuff (no offense to you, Major
Carrington) that makes the trouble of the times both here and at home.
I sigh for the good old days when, for eleven sweet years, no Parliament
sat to meddle in affairs of state, when Wentworth kept down faction and
the saintly Laud built up the Church which he adorned.""  And the
Governor buried his woes in the Rhenish.

""Sir William Berkeley’s loyalty is proverbial,"" said Sir Charles
suavely.  ""The King knows that while he is at the helm in Virginia, the
colony is on the high road to that era of peace and prosperity which his
majesty so ardently desires—for his tax-paying people.  And I have
thought more than once of late that I might do worse than to dispose of
my majority in the ’Blues,’ bid the Court adieu, and obtaining from his
Majesty a grant of land, retire here to Virginia to pass my days on my
own land and amid a little court of my own, in the patriarchal fashion
you gentlemen affect.  Under certain circumstances it is a course I
might possibly pursue.""  He glanced at his kinsman, whose countenance
showed high approval of a plan which dovetailed nicely with one of his
own making.

""Can you guess the ’certain circumstances’ which are to give us the
pleasure of his confounded company?"" whispered Mr. Peyton to Mr. Carey.

""An easy riddle, Jack.  Damn the insolent, smooth-spoken knave of
hearts, and confound the women! They all drop to a court card.""

""Not Mistress Betty Carrington.  She looks below the surface.""

""Humph!  What does she see below thine?  An empty gourd with a few
madrigals and sonnets, and fine images, conned from the ’Grand Cyrus,’
rattling about like dried seeds?""

""Hush, thou green persimmon! the Governor is speaking.""

The governor rose with care to his feet.  His wig was awry, his cravat
of fine mechlin under one ear. Benevolent smiles played like summer
lightning across his flushed face.  He raised his tankard slowly and
with attentive steadiness.  ""Gentlemen,"" he said in a high voice, ""we
have eaten and we have drunken. Dick Verney’s wine is as old as the
hills and as mellow as sunlight.  It groweth late, gentlemen, and some
of you have miles to travel, and it takes cool heads to ride the
’planter’s pace.’  For William Berkeley, gentlemen, Governor of Virginia
by the grace of God and his Majesty, King Charles the Second, it takes
more than Dick Verney’s wine to fluster him.  I call a final toast.  I
drink again to our loving friend and host, the worshipful Colonel
Richard Verney, to his beauteous daughter and sister, to his man-servant
and his maid-servant, his ox and his ass, and the stranger which is
within his gates.""  He smiled benignly at a reflection of Sir Charles in
a distant mirror. ""Gentlemen, the devil, you see, can quote scripture.
Let the cup go roun’ go roun’, go roun’.""

The toast was drunk with fervor, and the party broke up.

The Governor, with Colonel Ludlow and Captain Laramore, was to sleep at
Verney Manor, and Mistress Betty Carrington was left by her father to
bear Patricia company for a day or two.  One by one the remainder of the
company rode or sailed away, those who had an even keel beneath them
being in much better case than their brethren on horseback.

When the last sail showed a white speck in the distance, Patricia and
Betty came out upon the porch and sat them down, one on either side of
the Governor, with whom they were great favorites.  Colonel Ludlow and
Captain Laramore were at dice at a table within the hall, and Colonel
Verney had excused himself in order to hear the evening report from his
overseers.  Sir Charles Carew, very idle and purposeless-looking,
lounged in a great chair, and studied the miniature upon his snuff-box.
The Governor, whom the wine had mellowed into a genial softness, a kind
of sunset glow, alternately puffed wide rings of smoke into the air, and
paid compliments to the young ladies. The evening breeze had sprung up,
rustling the leaves of the trees, and bringing with it the sound of the
water.  In the western sky crimson islets forever shifted shapes in a
sea of gold.  A rosy light suffused the earth.  In it the water turned
to the pink of a shell, the marshes became ethereal and far away, earth
and sky seemed one.  The flashing wings of gull and curlew were like
fairy sails faring to and fro.

""If I had wings,"" said Patricia dreamily, her hands clasped over her
knees, ""I would fly straight to that highest island of cloud.  The one,
Betty, that looks like a field of daffodils, with those beautiful peaks
rising from it, and the violet light in the hollows.  I would set up my
standard there, Sir William, and the island should be mine, and I would
rule the fairies that must inhabit it, with a rod of iron—as you rule
Virginia,"" she ended with a laugh.

The Governor laughed with her.  ""You would have no such stiff-necked
folk to deal with, my love, as have I.""

""No, they should all be good Cavaliers and Churchmen—no Roundheads, no
servants—and if Indians on neighboring isles threatened we would pray
for a wind and sail away from them, around and around the bright blue
sky.""

""And when you are gone to take possession of your castle in the air what
will poor Virginia do?"" gallantly demanded the governor.

""Oh, she would still exist!  But I am not going to-night.  The princess
of the castle in the air is engaged to his Excellency the Governor of
Virginia for a game of chess.  In the mean time here comes my father,
who shall entertain your Excellency while Betty and I go for a walk.
Come, Lady-bird.""

The two graceful figures twined arms and moved off down the walk.  Sir
Charles looked after them a moment, then, with a ""Permit me, sir,"" to
the Governor, he snapped the lid of his snuff-box and started down the
steps.  The Governor laughed.  ""We will excuse you, sir,"" he said
graciously.  ""Dick,"" to Colonel Verney, as the young gentleman hastened
after the ladies, ""that fine spark is to be your son-in-law, eh?""

""It is the wish of my heart, William.""

""Humph!""

""He has birth and breeding.  His father was my good friend and kinsman,
and as loyal a Cavalier as ever gave life and lands for the blessed
Martyr.  He died in my arms at Marston Moor, and with his last breath
commended his son to me.  My dear wife was then expecting the birth of
our child, of Patricia.  I can see him now as he smiled up at me (he was
ever gay) and said, ’If it’s a girl, Dick, marry her to my boy.’  Well!
he died, and his brother took the boy, and my wife and I came over seas,
and I never saw the lad from that day to this, when he comes at my
invitation to visit us.""

""Well, he is a very pretty fellow!  And what does Patricia say to him?""

""Patricia is a good daughter,"" said the Colonel sedately, ""and is
possessed of sense beyond the average of womenkind.  She knows the
advantages this match offers.  Sir Charles Carew can give her a title,
and a name that’s as old as her own.  He is a man of parts and
distinction, has served the King, is familiar with the courts of Europe.
I do not pin my faith to the tales that are told of him.  His father was
a gallant gentleman, and I am not the man to believe ill of his son.
Moreover, if, as he hath half promised, he will come to Virginia, he
will throw off here the vices of the Court, the faults of youth, and
become an honest Virginia gentleman, God-fearing, law-abiding,
reverencing the King, but not copying him too closely—such an one as
them or I, William.  The king should give him large grants of land, and
so, with what Patricia will have when I am gone, there will be laid the
foundation of a great and noble estate, which, please God, will belong
in the fair future of this fair land to a great and noble family sprung
from the union of Verney and Carew.  Patricia, trust me, sees all this
with my eyes.""

""Humph!"" said the Governor again.




                              *CHAPTER IV*

                          *THE BREAKING HEART*


Sir Charles was up with the two girls before they reached the garden;
and they passed together through the gate and into the spicy wilderness.
The dew was falling and as they sauntered through the narrow paths,
Betty held back her skirts that the damp leaves of sage and marjoram
might not brush them; but Patricia, gathering larkspur and
sweet-william, was heedless of her finery.  At the further end of the
garden was a wicket leading into a grove of mulberries.  The three
walked on beneath the spreading branches and the broad, heart-shaped
leaves, until they came to a tree of extraordinary height and girth
whose roots bulged out into great, smooth excrescences like inverted
bowls.  Patricia stopped.  ""Betty is tired,"" she said kindly, ""and she
shall sit here and rest.  Betty is a windflower, Sir Charles, a little
tender timid flower, frail and sweet—are you not, Betty?""  She sat down
upon one of the bowls, and pulled her friend down beside her.  Sir
Charles leaned against the trunk of the tree.  ""Betty is a little
Puritan,"" continued Patricia; ""she would not wear the set of ribbons I
had for her; and that hurt me very much.""

""O Patricia!"" cried Betty, with tears in her eyes. ""If I thought you
really cared!  But even then I could not wear them!""

""No, you little martyr,"" said the other, with a kiss. ""You would go to
the stake any day for what you call your ’principles.’  And I honor you
for it, you know I do.  Cousin Charles, do you know that Betty thinks it
wrong to hold slaves?""

Sir Charles laughed, and Betty’s delicate face flushed.

""O Patricia!"" she cried.  ""I did not say that!  I only said that we
would not like it ourselves.""

""’Pon my soul, I don’t suppose we would,"" said Sir Charles coolly.
""But, Mistress Betty, the negroes have neither thin skins nor nice
feelings.""

""I know that,"" said Betty bravely; ""and I know that our divines and
learned men cannot yet decide whether or not they have souls.  And, of
course, if they have not, they are as well treated as other animals; but
all the same I am sorry for them, and I am sorry for the servants too.""

""For the servants!"" cried Patricia, arching her brows.

""Yes,"" said Betty, standing to her guns.  ""I am sorry for the servants,
for those who must work seven years for another before they can do aught
for themselves.  And often when their time is out they are bowed and
broken; and those whom they love at home, and would bring over, are
dead: and often before the seven years have passed they die themselves.
And I am sorry for those whom you call rebels, for the Oliverians; and
for the convicts, despised and outcast.  And for the Indians about us,
dispossessed and broken, and—yes, I am sorry for the Quakers.""

""I waste no pity on the under dog,"" said Sir Charles.  ""Keep him
down—and with a heavy hand—or he will fly at your throat.""

""Hark!"" said Patricia.

Some one in the distance was singing:—

    ""Gentle herdsman, tell to me
      Of courtesy I thee pray,
    Unto the town of Walsingham,
      Which is the right and ready way?

    ""Unto the town of Walsingham
      The way is hard for to be gone,
    And very crooked are those paths
      For you to find out all alone.""


The notes were wild and plaintive, and sounded sadly through the
gathering dusk.  A figure flitted towards them between the shadowy tree
trunks.

""It is Mad Margery,"" said Patricia.

""And who is Mad Margery?"" asked Sir Charles.

""No one knows, cousin.  She does not know herself.  Ten years ago a ship
came in with servants, and she was on it.  She was mad then.  The
captain could give no account of her, save that when, the day after
sailing, he came to count the servants, he found one more than there
should have been, and that one a woman, stupid from drugs.  She had been
spirited on board the ship, that was all he could say.  It’s a common
occurrence, as you know.  She never came to herself,—has always been
what she is now.  She was sold to a small planter, and cruelly treated
by him. After a time my father heard her story and bought her from her
master.  She has been with us ever since. Her term of service is long
out; but there is nothing that could drive her from this plantation.
She wanders about as she pleases, and has a cabin in the woods yonder;
for she will not live in the quarters.  They say that she is a white
witch; and the Indians, who reverence the mad, lay maize and venison at
her door.""

The voice, shrill and sweet, rang out close at hand.

    ""Thy years are young, thy face is fair,
      Thy wits are weak, thy thoughts are green,
    Time hath not given thee leave as yet,
      For to commit so great a sin.""


""Margery!"" called Patricia softly.

The woman came towards them with a peculiar gliding step, swift and
stealthy.  Within a pace or two of them she stopped, and asked, ""Who
called me?"" in a voice that seemed to come from far away. She was not
old, and might once have been beautiful.

""I called you, Margery,"" said Patricia gently. ""Sit down beside us, and
tell us what you have been doing.""

The woman came and sat herself down at Patricia’s feet.  She carried a
stick, or light pole, wound with thick strings of wild hops, which she
laid on the ground.  Taking one of the wreaths from around it, she
dropped the pale green mass into Patricia’s lap.

""Take it,"" she said.  ""They are flowers I gathered in Paradise, long
ago.  They wither in this air; but if you fan them with your sighs, and
water them with your tears, they will revive....  Paradise is a long way
from here.  I have been seeking the road all day; but I have not found
it yet.  I think it must lie near Bristol Town, Bristol Town, Bristol
Town.""

Her voice died away in a long sigh, and she sat plucking at the fragrant
blooms.

Patricia said softly, ""She talks much of Bristol Town, and she is always
seeking the road to Paradise. I think that once some one must have said
to her, ’We will meet in Paradise.’""

""I know little of Paradise, Margery,"" said Sir Charles, good-naturedly;
""but Bristol Town is many leagues from here, across the great ocean.""

""Yes, I know.  It lieth in the rising of the sun.  I have never seen it
except in my dreams.  But it is a beautiful place—not like this world of
trees.  The church bells are ever ringing there, ... and the children
sing in the streets.  It is all fair, and smiling and beautiful, all but
one spot, one black, black, black spot.  I will tell you.""  She sunk her
voice to a whisper and looked fearfully around.  ""The mouth of the Pit
is there, the Bottomless Pit that the Preacher tells about.  It is a
small room, dark, dark, ... and there is a heavy smell in the air, ...
and there are fiends with black cloth over their faces. They hold a
draught of hell to your mouth, and they make you drink it; ... it burns,
burns.  And then you go down, down, down, into everlasting blackness.""

She broke off, and shuddered violently, then burst into eldritch
laughter.

""Shall I tell you what I found just now while I was looking for
Paradise?""

""Yes,"" said Patricia.

""A breaking heart.""

""A breaking heart!""

Margery nodded.  ""Yes,"" she said.  ""I thought it would surprise you.  I
find many things, looking for Paradise.  The other day I found a brown
pixie sitting beneath a mushroom, and he told me curious things.  But a
breaking heart is different.  I know all about it, for once upon a time
my heart broke; but mine was soft and easy to break.  It was as soft,
and weak as a baby’s wrist, a little, tender, helpless thing, you know,
that melts under your kisses.  But this heart that I found will take a
long time to break. Proud anger will strengthen it at first; but one
string will snap, and then another, and another, until, at last—"" she
swept her arms abroad with a wild and desolate gesture.

""What does she mean?"" asked Sir Charles.

""I do not know,"" answered Patricia.

Margery rose and took up her leafy staff,

""Come,"" she said.  ""Come and see the breaking heart.""

""O Patricia!"" cried Betty, ""do not go with her!""

""Why not?"" asked Patricia resolutely.  ""Come, cousin, let us find out
what she means.  We will go with you, Margery; but you must not take us
far.  It grows late.""

Margery laughed weirdly.  ""It is never late for Margery.  There is a
star far up in heaven that is sorry for Margery, and it shines for her,
bright, bright, all night long, that she may not miss the road to
Paradise.""

She glided in front of them, and moved rapidly down the dim alley of
trees, her feet seeming scarce to touch the short grass, and the long
green wreaths, stirred by the wind, coiling and uncoiling around her
staff like serpents.  Patricia, with Betty and Sir Charles, followed her
closely.  She led them out of the mulberry grove, through a small
vineyard, and into a patch of corn, beyond which could be seen the gleam
of water, faintly pink from the faded sunset.

""She is taking us towards the quarters!"" exclaimed Patricia.  ""Margery!
Margery!""

But Margery held on, moving swiftly through the waist-deep corn.  Betty
looked down with a little sigh at her dainty shoes, which were suffering
by their contact with the dew-laden leaves of pumpkins and macocks.  Sir
Charles put aside the long corn blades with his cane, and so made a way
for the girls.  He felt mildly curious and somewhat bored.

Suddenly they emerged upon the banks of the inlet, within a hundred
yards of the quarters.  Patricia would have spoken, but Margery put her
finger to her lips and flitted on towards the row of cabins.

Before them stretched a long, narrow lane, sandy and barren, with a
pine-tree rising here and there. Rude cabins, windowless and with mud
chimneys, faced each other across the lane.  Half way down was an open
space, or small square, in the centre of which stood a dead tree with a
board nailed across its trunk at about a man’s height from the ground.
In either end of the board was cut a round hole big enough for a man’s
hand to be squeezed through, and above hung a heavy stick with leathern
thongs tied to it, the whole forming a pillory and whipping-post, rude,
but satisfactory.

It was almost dark.  The larger stars had come out, and the fireflies
began to sparkle restlessly.  The wind sighed in the pines, and a strong
salt smell came from the sea.  Overhead a whippoorwill uttered its
mournful cry.

The long day’s work, from sunrise to sunset, was over, and the
population of the quarter had drifted in from the fields of tobacco and
maize, the boats, the carpenter’s shop, the forge, the mill, the
stables, and barns.  Hard-earned rest was theirs, and they were prepared
to enjoy it.  It was supper-time.  In the square a great fire of
brush-wood had been kindled, and around it squatted a ring of negroes,
busy with bowls of loblolly and great chunks of corn bread. They
chattered like monkeys, and one who had finished his mess raised a chant
in which one note was a yell of triumph, the next a long-drawn plaintive
wail.  The rich barbaric voice filled the night.  A figure, rising,
tossed aside an empty bowl, and began to dance in the red fire-light.

The white men ate at their cabin doors, sitting upon logs of wood, or in
groups of three or four messed at tables made by stretching planks from
one tree-stump to another.  It was meat-day; and they, too, made merry.
From the women’s cabins also came shrill laughter.  Snatches of song
arose, altercations that suddenly began and as suddenly ceased, a babel
of voices in many fashions of speech.  Broad Yorkshire contended with
the thin nasal tones of the cockney; the man from the banks of the Tweed
thrust cautious sarcasms at the man from Galway.  A mulatto, the color
of pale amber, spoke sonorous Spanish to an olive-hued piece of
drift-wood from Florida.  An Indian indulged in a monologue in a tongue
of a far-away tribe of the Blue Mountains.

The glare from the fire and from flaring pine-knots played fitfully over
the motley throng, now bringing out in strong relief some one face or
figure, then plunging it into profoundest shadow.  It burnished the high
forehead and scalp lock of the Indian, and made to gleam intensely the
gold earring in the ear of the mulatto.  The scarlet cloth wound about
the head of a Turk seemed to turn to actual flame. Under the baleful
light vacant faces of dully honest English rustics became malignant,
while the negro, dancing with long, outstretched arms and uncouth
swayings to and fro, appeared a mirthful fiend.

The three gentlefolk and their mad conductress gazed from out the shadow
and at a safe distance. Sir Charles Carew, a man of taste, felt strong
artistic pleasure in the Rembrandtesque scene before him—the leaping
light, the weird shadows, resolving themselves into figures posed with
savage freedom, the dancing satyr, the sombre pines above, and, beyond
the pines, the stillness of the stars.  Betty drew a little shuddering
breath, and her hand went to clasp Patricia’s.  The latter was looking
steadily upward at the slender crescent moon.

""Do not look, Betty,"" she said quietly.  ""I do not. It is a horror to
me—a horror.  I am going back,"" she said, turning.

But she had reckoned without Margery, who caught her by the arm.
""Come,"" she said imperiously. ""Come and see the breaking heart!""
Patricia hesitated, then yielded to curiosity and the insistent pressure
of the skeleton fingers.

The cabins nearest them were deserted, their occupants having joined
themselves to the groups further down the lane where the firelight beat
strongest and the torches were more numerous.  With no more sound than a
moth would make, flitting through the dusk, the mad woman led them to
the outermost of these cabins.  Within five paces of the door she
stopped and pointed a long forefinger.

""The breaking heart!"" she said in a triumphant whisper.

A man lay, face downwards, in the coarse and scanty grass.  One arm was
bent beneath his forehead, the other was outstretched, the hand
clenched. It was the attitude of one who has flung himself down in dumb,
despairing misery.  As they looked, he gave a long gasping sob that
shook his whole frame, then lay quiet.

A burst of revelry came down the lane.  The man raised his head
impatiently, then let it drop again upon his arm.

Patricia turned and walked quickly back the way they had come.  Betty
and Sir Charles followed her; Margery, her whim gratified, had vanished
into the darkness of the pines.

No one spoke until they were again amidst the wet and rustling corn.
Then said Betty with tears in her voice, ""O Patricia, darling! there is
so much misery in the world, fair and peaceful as it looks to-night.
That poor man!""

""That ’poor man,’ Betty,"" answered Patricia in a hard voice, ""is a
criminal, a felon, guilty of some dreadful, sordid thing, a gaol-bird
reclaimed from the gallows and sent here to pollute the air we breathe.""

""It was the convict, Landless, was it not?"" asked Sir Charles.

""Yes.""

""But, Patricia,"" said the gentle Betty, ""whatever he may have done, he
is wretched now.""

""He has sowed the wind; let him reap the whirlwind,"" said Patricia
steadily.

They went on to the house and into the great room where the myrtle
candles were burning softly, the dimity curtains shutting out the night.
Mrs. Lettice was at the spinet, with Captain Laramore to turn the leaves
of her song book, and the Governor, with the chess table out and the
pieces in battle array, awaited (he said) the arrival of the Princess of
the Castle in the Air.




                              *CHAPTER V*

                       *IN THE THREE-MILE FIELD*


In a far corner of the Three-mile Field Landless bent over tobacco plant
after tobacco plant, patiently removing the little green shoots or
""suckers"" from the parent stem.

His back and limbs ached from the unaccustomed stooping, the fierce
sunshine beat upon his head, the blood pounded behind his temples, his
tongue clave to the roof of his mouth,—and the noontide rest was still
two hours away.  As, with a gasp of weariness, he straightened himself,
the endless plain of green rose and fell to his dazzled eyes in misty
billows.  The most robust rustic required several months of seasoning
before he and the Virginia climate became friends, and this man was
still weak from privation and confinement in prison and in the noisome
hold of the ship.

He turned his weary eyes from the vivid gold green of the fields to the
shadows of the forest.  It lay within a few yards of him, just on the
other side of a little stream and a rail fence that zigzagged in gray
lines hung with creepers.  At the moment he defined happiness as a
plunge into the cool, perfumed darkness, a luxurious flinging of a tired
body upon the carpet of pine needles, a shutting out, forever, of the
sunshine.

Suddenly he felt that eyes were upon him, and his glance traveled from
the fringe of trees to meet that of an Indian seated upon a log in an
angle of the fence.

He was a man of gigantic stature, dressed in coarse canvas breeches, and
with a handkerchief of gaudy dye twisted about his head.  His bold
features wore the usual Indian expression of saturnine imperturbability,
and he half sat, half reclined upon the log as motionless as a piece of
carven bronze, staring at Landless with large, inscrutable eyes.

Landless, staring in return, saw something else. The rank growth of
weeds in which the log was sunk moved ever so slightly.  There was a
flash as of a swiftly drawn rapier, and something long and mottled hung
for an instant upon the shoulder of the Indian, and then dropped into
its lair again.

With a sudden lithe twist of his body, the savage flung himself upon it,
and holding it down with one hand, with the other beat the life out with
a heavy stick.  The creature was killed by the first stroke, but he
continued to rain vindictive blows upon it until it was mashed to a
pulp.  Then, with a serenely impassive mien, he resumed his seat upon
the log.

Landless sprang across the stream, and went up to him.

""You are bitten!  Is there aught I can do?""

The Indian shook his head.  With one hand he pulled the shoulder
forward, trying, as Landless saw, to meet the wound with his lips: but
finding that it could not be done, he desisted and sat silent, and to
all appearance, unconcerned.

Landless cried out impatiently, ""It will kill you, man!  Do you know no
remedy?""

The Indian grunted.  ""Snake root grow deep in the forest, a long way
off.  Besides, an Iroquois does not die for a little thing like a pale
face or a dog of an Algonquin.""

""Why did you try to reach the sting with your mouth?""

""To suck out the evil.""

""Is that a cure?""

The Indian nodded.  Landless knelt down and examined the shoulder.
""Now,"" he said, ""tell me if I set about it in the right way,"" and
applied his lips to the swollen, blue-black spot.

The Indian gave a grunt of surprise, and his white teeth flashed in a
smile; then he sat silent under the ministrations of the white man who
sucked at the wound, spitting the venom upon the ground, until the dark
skin was drawn and wrinkled like the hand of a washerwoman.

""Good!"" then said the Indian, and pointed to the stream.  Landless went
to it, rinsed his mouth, and brought back water in his cap with which he
laved the shoulder of his new acquaintance, ending by binding it up with
the handkerchief from the man’s head.

A guttural sound from the Indian made him look up.  At the same instant
the whip of the overseer, descending, cut him sharply across the
shoulders, he sprang to his feet, the veins in his forehead swollen, his
frame tense with impotent anger.  The overseer, having gained his
attention, thrust the whip back into his belt.

""If you don’t want to get what will hurt as bad as a snake bite,"" he
said grimly, ""you had best tend to your tobacco and let vagrom Indians
alone.  That row is to be suckered before dinner-time or your pork and
beans will go begging.  As for you,"" turning to the Indian, ""what are
you doing on this plantation? Where ’s your pass?""

The Indian took from his waistband a slip of paper which he handed to
the overseer, who looked at it and gave it back with a grudging—""It’s
all right this time, but you ’d better be careful.  It’s my opinion that
Major Carrington lets his servants run about a deal more than ’s good
for them.  Anyhow, you ’ve no business in this field.  Clear out!""

The Indian arose and went his way.  But as he passed Landless, suckering
a plant with angry energy, he touched him, as if by accident, with his
sinewy hand.

""Monakatocka never forgives an enemy,"" came in a sibilant whisper too
low to be heard by the watchful overseer.  ""Monakatocka never forgets a
friend. Some day he will repay.""

The red-brown body slipped away through the tall weeds and clumps of
alder, like the larger edition of the thing that had hung upon its
shoulder.  The overseer strode off down the field, sending keen glances
to right and left.  He was a conscientious man and earned every pound of
his wages.

Landless, left alone, worked steadily on, for he had no mind to lose his
midday meal, uninviting as he knew it would prove to be.  Moreover, he
was one who did with his might what his hand found to do. His body was
weary, and his heart sick within him, but the green shoots fell thick
and fast.

""Yon was a kindly thing you did.  Pity ’t was in no better cause than
the saving of a worthless natural.""

The speaker, who was at work on the next row of plants, had caught up
with Landless from behind, and now moved his nimble fingers more slowly,
so as to keep pace with the less expert new hand.

Landless, raising his head, stared at a figure of positively terrifying
aspect.  Upon a skeleton body of extraordinary height was set a head
bare of any hair.  Scalp, forehead and cheeks were of one dull, ivory
hue like an eastern carving.  Upon the smooth, dead surface of the right
cheek sprawled a great red R, branded into the flesh, and through each
large protruding ear went a ragged hole.  For the rest, the lips were of
iron, and the small, deep-set eyes were so bright and burning that they
gave the impression that they were red like the great letter.  It might
have been the face of a man of sixty years, though it would have been
hard to tell wherein lay the semblance of age, so smooth was the skin
and so brilliant the eyes.

""The Indian needed help.  Why should I not have given it him?"" said
Landless.

""Because it is written, ’Cursed are the heathen who inhabit the land.’""

Landless smiled.  ""So you would not help an Indian in extremity.  What
if it had been a negro?""

""Cursed are the negroes!  ’Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by the
sword.’""

""A Quaker?""

""Cursed are the Quakers!  ’Silly doves that have no heart.’""

Landless laughed.  ""You have cursed pretty well all the oppressed of the
land.  I suppose you reserve your blessings for the powers that be.""

""The powers that be!  May the plagues of Egypt light upon them, and the
seven vials rain down their contents upon them!  Cursed be they all,
from the young man, Charles Stuart, to that prelatical, tyrannical,
noxious Malignant, William Berkeley!  May their names become a hissing
and an abomination! Roaring lions are their princes, ravening wolves are
their judges, their priests have polluted the sanctuary! May their flesh
consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes consume
away in their holes, and their tongues consume away in their mouths, and
may there be mourning among them, even as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in
the valley of Megiddon!""

""You are a Muggletonian?""

""Yea, verily am I! a follower of the saintly Ludovick Muggleton, and of
the saintlier John Reeve, of whom Ludovick is but the mouthpiece, even
as Aaron was of Moses.  They are the two witnesses of the Apocalypse.
They are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks.  To them and to
their followers it is given to curse and to spare not, to prophesy
against the peoples and kindred and nations and tongues whereon is set
the seal of the beast.  Wherefore I, Win-Grace Porringer, testify
against the people of this land; against Prelatists and Papists,
Presbyterians and Independents, Baptists, Quakers and heathen; against
princes, governors, and men in high places; against them that call
themselves planters and trample the vineyard of the Lord; against their
sons and their daughters who are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth
neck and wanton eyes, walking and mincing and making a tinkling with
their feet.  Cursed be they all!  Surely they shall be as Sodom and
Gomorrah, even the breeding of salt-pits and a perpetual desolation!""

""Your curses seem not to have availed, friend,"" said Landless.  ""Curses
are apt to come home to roost.  I should judge that yours have returned
to you in the shape of branding-irons.""

The man raised a skeleton hand and stroked the red letter.

""This,"" he said coolly, ""was given me when I ran away the second time.
The first time I was merely whipped.  The third time I was shaven and
this shackle put upon my leg.""  He raised his foot and pointed to an
iron ring encircling the ankle.  ""The fourth time I was nailed by the
ears to the pillory, whence come these pretty scars.""

Landless burst into grim laughter.  ""And after your fifth attempt, what
then?""

The man gave him a sidelong look.  ""I have not made my fifth attempt,""
he said quietly.

They worked in silence for a few minutes.  Then said Master Win-Grace
Porringer:—

""I was sent to the plantations, because, in defiance of the Act of
Uniformity (cursed be it, and the authors thereof), I attended a meeting
of the persecuted and broken remnant of the Lord’s people. What was your
offense, friend, for I reckon that you come not here of your free will,
being neither a rustic nor a fool?""

""I came from Newgate,"" said Landless, after a pause.  ""I am a convict.""

The man’s hand stopped in the act of pulling off a shoot.  He gave a
slow upward look at the figure beside him, let his eyes rest upon the
face, and looked slowly down again with a shake of the head.

""Humph!"" he said.  ""The society in Newgate must be improved since my
time.""

They worked without speaking until they had nearly reached the end of
the long double row, when said the Muggletonian:—

""You are too young, I take it, to have seen service in the wars?""

""I fought at Worcester.""

""Upon which side?""

""The Commonwealth’s.""

""I thought as much.  Humph!  You were all, Parliament and Presbytery,
Puritan and Independent, Hampden and Vane and Oliver, in the gall of
bitterness and the bond of iniquity, very far from the pure light in
which walk the followers of the blessed Ludovick.  At the last the two
witnesses will speak against you also.  But in the mean time it were
easier for the children of light to walk under the rule of the Puritan
than under that of the lascivious house of Jeroboam which now afflicts
England for her sins.  But the Lord hath a controversy with them!  An
east wind shall come up, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the
wilderness!  They shall be moved from their places!  They shall lick the
dust like serpents, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the
earth, and be utterly destroyed!  Think you not as I do, friend?"" he
asked, turning suddenly upon Landless.

""I think,"" said Landless, ""that you are talking that which, if
overheard, might give you a deeper scar than any you bear.""

""But who is to hear? the tobacco, the Lord in heaven, and you.  The
senseless plant will keep counsel, the Lord is not like to betray his
servant, and as for you, friend,—"" he looked long and searchingly at
Landless.  ""Despite the place you come from, I do not think you one to
bring a man into trouble for being bold enough to say what you dare only
think.""

Landless returned the look.  ""No,"" he said quietly. ""You need have no
fear of me.""

""I fear no one,"" said the other proudly.

Presently he craned his long body across the plant between them until
his lips almost touched the ear of the younger man.

""Shall you try to escape?"" he whispered.

A smile curled Landless’s lip.  ""Very probably I shall,"" he said dryly.
He looked down the long lines of broad green leaves at the toiling
figures, black and white, dull peasants at best, scoundrels at worst;
and beyond to the huddled cabins of the quarter, and to the great house,
rising fair and white from orchard and garden; seeing, as in a dream, a
man, young in years but old in sorrow, disgraced, outcast, friendless,
alone, creeping down a vista of weary years, day after day of
soul-deadening toil, of association with the mean and the vile, of
shameful submission to whip and finger.  Escape!  The word had beaten
through brain and heart so long and so persistently, that at times he
feared lest he should cry it aloud.

Win-Grace Porringer shook his head.

""It’s not an easy thing to escape from a Virginia plantation.  With dogs
and with horses they hunt you down, yea, with torches and boats.  They
band themselves together against the fleeing sparrow.  They call in the
heathen to their aid.  And it is a fearful land, for great rivers bar
your way, and forests push you back, and deep quagmires clutch you and
hold you until the men of blood come up.  And when you are taken they
cruelly maltreat you, and your term of service is doubled.""

""And yet men have gotten away,"" said Landless.

""Yes, but not many.  And those that get away are seldom heard of more.
The forest swallows them up, and after a while their skulls roll about
the hills, playthings for wolves, or the deep waters flow over their
bones, or they lie in a little heap of ashes at the foot of some Indian
torture stake.""

""Why did you try to escape?"" asked Landless.

The man gave him another sidelong look.

""I tried because I was a fool.  I am no longer a fool.  I know a better
way.""

""A better way!""

""Hush!"" The man looked over his shoulder and then whispered, ""Will you
go with me to-night?""

""Go with you!  Where?""

""To a man I know—a man who gives good advice.""

""Many can do that, friend.""

""Ay, but not show the way to profit by it as doth this man.""

""Who is he?""

""A servant even as we are servants,—a learned and godly man, albeit not
a follower of the blessed Ludovick.  Listen!  About the rising of the
moon to-night, slip from your cabin and come to the blasted pine on the
shore of the inlet.  There will be a boat there and I will be in it.  We
will go to the cabin of the man of whom I speak.  He is a cripple, and
knowing that he cannot run away, the godless and roistering Malignant
who calls himself our master hath given him a hut among the marshes,
where he mendeth nets.  Come!  I may not say more than that it will be
worth your while.""

""If we are caught—""

""Our skins pay for us.  But the Lord will shut the eyes of the overseers
that they see not, and their ears that they hear not, and we will be
safely back before the dawn.  You will come?""

""Yes,"" said Landless.  ""I will come.""




                              *CHAPTER VI*

                         *THE HUT ON THE MARSH*


It was shortly after midnight when the two servants slipped along the
inlet, silently and warily, and keeping their boat well under the shore.
It was a crazy affair, barely large enough for two, and requiring
constant bailing.  When they had made half a mile from the quarters, the
Muggletonian, who rowed, turned the boat’s head across the inlet, and
ran into a very narrow creek that wound in many doubles through the
marshes.  They entered it, made the first turn, and the broad bosom of
the inlet, lit by a low, crimson moon, was as if it had never been.  On
every side high marsh grass soughed in the night wind,—plains of
blackness with the red moon rising from them.  The tide was low.  So
close were the banks of wet, black earth, that they heard the crabs
scuttling down them, and Porringer made a jab with his pole at a great
sheepshead lying _perdu_ alongside.  The water broke before them into
spangles, glittering phosphorescent ripples.  A school of small fish,
disturbed by the oars, rushed past them, leaping from the water with
silver flashes.  A turtle plunged sullenly.  From the grass above came
the sleepy cry of marsh hens, and once a great white heron rose like a
ghost across their path. It flapped its wings and sailed away with a
scream of wrath.

The boat had wound its tortuous way for many minutes before Porringer
said in a low voice: ""We can speak safely now.  There is nothing human
moving on these flats unless the witch, Margery, is abroad. Cursed may
she be, and cursed those who give her shelter and food and raiment and
lay offerings at her door, for surely it is written, ’Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.’""

""Is there anything a Muggletonian will not curse?"" asked Landless.

""Yea,"" answered the other complacently.  ""There are ourselves, the salt
of the earth.  There are a thousand or more of us.""

""And the remainder of the inhabitants of the earth are reprobate and
doomed?""

""Yea, verily, they shall be as the burning of lime, as thorns cut up
will they be burned in the fire.""

""Then why have you to do with me, and with the man to whom we are
going?""

""Because it is written: ’Make ye friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness;’ and moreover there be degrees even in hell fire.  I do
not place you, who have some inkling of the truth, nor the Independents
and Fifth Monarchy men (as for the Quakers they shall be utterly damned)
in the furnace seven times heated which is reserved for the bigoted and
bloody Prelatists who rule the land, swearing strange oaths, foining
with the sword, and delighting in vain apparel; keeping their feast days
and their new moons and their solemn festivals.  They are the rejoicing
city that dwells carelessly, that says in her heart, ’I am, and there is
none beside me.’  The day cometh when they shall be broken as the
breaking of a potter’s vessel, yea, they shall be violently tossed like
a ball into a far country.""

Here they struck a snag, well-nigh capsizing the boat.  When she
righted, and Landless had bailed her out with a gourd, they proceeded in
silence. Landless was in no mood for speech.  He did not know where they
were going, nor for what purpose, nor did he greatly care.  He meant to
escape, and that as soon as his strength should be recovered and he
could obtain some knowledge of the country, and he meant to take no one
into his counsel, not the Muggletonian, whose own attempts had ended so
disastrously, nor the ’man who gave good advice.’  As to this midnight
expedition he was largely indifferent.  But it was something to escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the cabin where he had tossed from side
to side, listening to the heavy breathing of the convict, Turk, and
peasant lad with whom he was quartered, to the silver peace of
moon-flooded marsh and lapping water.

They made another turn, and in front of them shone out a light, gleaming
dully like a will-of-the-wisp. It looked close at hand, but the creek
turned upon itself, coiled and writhed through the marsh, and trebled
the distance.

The Muggletonian rested on his oar, and turned to Landless.

""Yonder is our bourne,"" he said gravely.  ""But I have a word to say to
you, friend, before we reach it. If, to curry favor with the
uncircumcised Philistines who set themselves over us, thou speakest of
aught thou mayest see or hear there to-night, may the Lord wither thy
tongue within thy mouth, may he smite thee with blindness, may he bring
thee quick into the pit!  And if not the Lord, then will I, Win-Grace
Porringer, rise and smite thee!""

""You may spare your invectives,"" said Landless coldly.  ""I am no
traitor.""

""Nay, friend,"" said the other in a milder tone.  ""I thought it not of
thee, or I had not brought thee thither.""

He shoved the nose of the boat into the shore, and caught at a stake,
rising, water-soaked and rotten, from below the bank.  Landless threw
him the looped end of a rope, and together they made the boat fast, then
scrambled up the three feet of fat, sliding earth to the level above
where the ground was dry, none but the highest of tides ever reaching
it.  Fifty yards away rose a low hut.  It stood close to another bend in
the creek, and before it were several boats, tied to stakes, and softly
rubbing their sides together.  The hut had no window, but there were
interstices between the logs through which the light gleamed redly.

When the two men had reached it, the Muggletonian knocked upon the heavy
door, after a peculiar fashion, striking it four times in all.  There
was a shuffling sound within, and (Landless thought) two voices ceased
speaking.  Then some one said in a low voice and close to the door: ""Who
is it?""

""The sword of the Lord and of Gideon,"" answered the Muggletonian.

A bar fell from the door, and it swung slowly inwards.

""Enter, friends,"" said a quiet voice.  Landless, stooping his head,
crossed the threshold, and found himself in the presence of a man with a
high, white forehead and a grave, sweet face, who, leaning on a stick,
and dragging one foot behind him, limped back to the settle from which
he had risen, and fell to work upon a broken net as calmly as if he were
alone. Besides themselves he was the only inmate of the room.

A pine torch, stuck into a cleft in the table, cast a red and flickering
light over a rude interior, furnished with the table, the settle, a
chest and a straw pallet. From the walls and rafters hung nets, torn or
mended. In one corner was a great heap of dingy sail, in another a sheaf
of oars, and a third was wholly in darkness.  Lying about the earthen
floor were several small casks to which the man motioned as seats.

Leaving Landless near the door, Win-Grace Porringer dragged a keg to the
side of the settle, and sitting down upon it, approached his death mask
of a face close to the face of the mender of nets, and commenced a
whispered conversation.  To Landless, awaiting rather listlessly the
outcome of this nocturnal adventure, came now and then a broken
sentence. ""He hath not the look of a criminal, but—""  ""Of Puritan
breeding, sayest thou?""  ""We need young blood.""  Then after prolonged
whispering, ""No traitor, at least.""

At length the Muggletonian arose and came towards Landless.  ""My friend
would speak with you alone,"" he said, ""I will stand guard outside.""  He
went out, closing the door behind him.

The mender of nets beckoned Landless.  ""Will you come nearer?"" he asked
in a quiet refined voice that was not without a ring of power.  ""As you
see, I am lame, and I cannot move without pain.""

Landless came and sat down beside the table, resting his elbow upon the
wood, and his chin upon his hand.  The mender of nets put down his work,
and the two measured each other in silence.

Landless saw a man of middle age who looked like a scholar, but who
might have been a soldier; a man with a certain strong, bright sweetness
of look in a spare, worn face, and underlying the sweetness a still and
deadly determination.  The mender of nets saw, in his turn, a figure
lithe and straight as an Indian’s, a well-poised head, and a handsome
face set in one fixed expression of proud endurance.  A determined face,
too, with dark, resolute eyes and strong mouth, the face of a man who
has done and suffered much, and who knows that he will both do and
suffer more.

""I am told,"" said the mender of nets, ""that you are newly come to the
plantations.""

""I was brought by the ship God-Speed a month ago.""

""You did not come as an indented servant?""

Landless reddened.  ""No.""

""Nor as a martyr to principle, a victim of that most iniquitous and
tyrannical Act of Uniformity?""

""No.""

""Nor as one of those whom they call Oliverians?""

""No.""

The mender of nets tapped softly Against the table with his thin, white
fingers.  Landless said coldly:—

""These are idle questions.  The man who brought me here hath told you
that I am a convict.""

The other looked at him keenly.  ""I have heard convicts talk before
this.  Why do you not assert your innocence?""

""Who would believe me if I did?""

There was a silence.  Landless, raising his eyes, met those of the
mender of nets, large, luminous, gravely tender, and reading him like a
book.

""I will believe you,"" said the mender of nets.

""Then, as God is above us,"" said the other solemnly, ""I did not do the
thing!  And He knows that I thank you, sir, for your trust.  I have not
found another—""

""I know, lad, I know!  How was it?""

""I was a Commonwealth’s man.  My father was dead, my kindred attainted,
and I had a powerful enemy.  I was caught in a net of circumstance.  And
Morton was my judge.""

""Humph! the marvel is that you ever got nearer to the plantations than
Tyburn.  Your name is—""

""Godfrey Landless.""

""Landless!  Once I knew—and loved—a Warham Landless—a brave soldier, a
gallant gentleman, a true Christian.  He fell at Worcester.""

""He was my father.""

The mender of nets covered his eyes with his hand. ""O Lord! how
wonderful are thy ways!"" he said beneath his breath, then aloud, ""Lad,
lad, I cannot wholly sorrow to see you here.  Wise in counsel, bold in
action, patient, farseeing, brave, was thy father, and I think thou hast
his spirit.  Thou hast his eyes, now that I look at thee more closely.
I have prayed for such a man.""

""I am glad you knew my father,"" said Landless simply.

After a long silence, in which the minds of both had gone back to other
days, the mender of nets spoke gravely.

""You have no cause to love the present government?""

""No,"" said Landless grimly.

""You were heart and hand for the Commonwealth?""

""Yes.""

""You mean to escape from this bondage?""

""Yes.""

The mender of nets took from his bosom a little worn book.  ""Will you
swear upon this that you will never reveal what I am about to say to
you, save to such persons as I shall designate?  For myself I would take
your simple word, for we are both gentlemen, but other lives than mine
hang in the balance.""

Landless touched the book with his lips.  ""I swear,"" he said.

The man brought his serene, white face nearer.

""What would you have given,"" he asked solemnly, ""for the cause for which
your father died?""

""My life,"" said Landless.

""Would you give it still?""

""A worthless gift,"" said Landless bitterly.  ""Yea, I would give it, but
the cause is dead.""

The other shook his head.  ""The cause of the just man dieth not.""

There was a pause broken by the mender of nets.

""Thou art no willing slave, I trow.  The thought of escape is ever with
thee.""

""I shall escape,"" said Landless deliberately.  ""And if they track me
they shall not take me alive.""

The mender of nets gave a melancholy smile. ""They would track you, never
fear!""  He leaned forward and touched Landless with his hand.  ""What if
I show you a better way?"" he asked in a whisper.

""What way?""

""A way to recover your liberty, and with it, the liberty of downtrodden
brethren.  A way to raise the banner of the Commonwealth and to put down
the Stuart.""

Landless stared.  ""A miserable hut,"" he said, ""in the midst of a
desolate Virginia marsh, and within it, a brace of slaves, the one a
cripple, the other a convict,—and Charles Stuart on his throne in
Whitehall!  Friend, this dismal place hath turned your wits!""

The other smiled.  ""My wits are sound,"" he said, ""as sound as they were
upon that day when I gave my voice for the death (a sad necessity!) of
this young man’s father.  And I do not think to shake England,—I speak
of Virginia.""

""Of Virginia!""

""Yea, of this goodly land, a garden spot, a new earth where should be
planted the seeds of a mighty nation, strong in justice and simple
right, wise, temperate, brave; an enlightened people, serving God in
spirit and in truth, not with the slavish observance of prelatist and
papist, nor with the indecent familiarity of the Independent; loyal to
their governors, but exercising the God-given right of choosing those
who are to rule over them: a people amongst whom liberty shall walk
unveiled, and to whom Astrœa shall come again; a people as free as the
eagle I watched this morning, soaring higher and ever higher, strongly
and proudly, rejoicing in its progress heavenward.""

""In other words, a republic,"" said Landless dryly.

""Why not?"" answered the other with shining, unseeing eyes.  ""It is a
dream we dreamed ten years ago, I and Vane and Sidney and Marten and
many others,—but Oliver rudely wakened us.  Then it was by the banks of
the Thames, and it was for England. Now, on the shores of Chesapeake I
dream again, and it is for Virginia.  You smile!""

""Have you considered, sir,—I do not know your name.""

""Robert Godwyn is my name.""

""Have you considered, Master Godwyn, that the Virginians do not want a
republic, that they are more royalist and prelatical than are their
brethren at home; that they out-Herod Herod in their fantastic loyalty?""

""That is true of the class with whom you have come into contact,—of the
masters.  But there is much disaffection among the people at large.  And
there are the Nonconformists, the Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists,
even the Quakers, though they say they fight not.  To them all, Charles
Stuart is the Pharaoh whose heart the Lord hardened, and William
Berkeley is his task-master.""

""Any one else?""

""There are those of the gentry who were Commonwealth’s men, and who
chafe sorely under the loss of office and disfavor into which they have
fallen.""

""And these all desire a republic?""

""They desire the downfall of the royalists with William Berkeley at
their head.  The republic would follow.""

""And when a handful of Puritan gentlemen, a few hundred Nonconformists,
and the rabble of the colony shall have executed this project, have
usurped the government, dethroning the king, or his governor, which is
the same thing,—then will come in from the mouth of Thames a couple of
royal frigates and blow your infant republic into space.""

""I do not think so.  Thu frigates would come undoubtedly, but I am of
another opinion as to the result of their coming.  They would not take
us unprepared as those of the Commonwealth took William Berkeley in
fifty-two.  And with a plentiful lack of money and a Dutch war
threatening, Charles Stuart could not send unlimited frigates.
Moreover, if Virginia revolted, Puritan New England would follow her
example, and she would find allies in the Dutch of New Amsterdam.""

""You spin large fancies,"" said Landless, with some scorn.  ""I suppose
you are plotting with these gentlemen you speak of?""

""No,"" said the man, with a scarcely perceptible hesitation.  ""No, they
are few in number and scattered. Moreover, they might plot amongst
themselves but never with—a servant.""

""Then you are concerned with the Nonconformists?""

""The Nonconformists are timid, and dream not that the day of deliverance
is at hand.""

Landless began to laugh.  ""Do you mean to say,"" he demanded, ""that you
and I, for I suppose you count on my assistance, are to enact a kind of
Pride’s Purge of our own?  That we are to drive from the land the King’s
Governor, Council, Burgesses and trainbands; sweep into the bay Sir
William Berkeley and Colonel Verney, and all those gold-laced planters
who dined with him the other day?  That we are to take possession of the
colony as picaroons do of a vessel, and hoisting our flag,—a crutch
surmounted by a ball and chain on a ground sable,—proclaim a republic?""

""Not we alone.""

""Oh, ay!  I forgot the worthy Muggletonian.""

""He is but one of many,"" said the mender of nets.

Landless leaned forward, a light growing in his eyes.  ""Speak out!"" he
said.  ""What is it that will break this chain?""

The mender of nets, too, bent forward from his settle until his breath
mingled with the breath of the younger man.

""A slave insurrection,"" he said.




                             *CHAPTER VII*

                           *A MENDER OF NETS*


""A slave insurrection!""

Landless, recoiling, struck with his shoulder the torch, which fell to
the floor.  The flame went out, leaving only a red gleaming end.  ""I
will get another,"" said the mender of nets, and limped to the corner
where the shadow had been thickest.  Landless, left in darkness, heard a
faint muttering as though Master Robert Godwyn were talking to himself.
It took some time to find the torch; but at length Godwyn returned with
one in his hand, and kindled it at the expiring light.

Landless rose from his seat, and strode to and fro through the hut.  His
pulses beat to bursting; there was a tingling at his finger-tips; to his
startled senses the hut seemed to expand, to become a cavern,
interminable and unfathomable, wide as the vaulted earth, filled with
awful, shadowy places and strange, lurid lights.  The mender of nets
became a far-off sphinx-like figure.

Godwyn watched him in silence.  He had a large knowledge of human
nature, and he saw into the mind and heart of the restless figure.  He
himself was a philosopher, and wore his chains lightly, but he guessed
that the iron had entered deeply into the soul of the man before him.
The sturdy peasants, indented servants with but a few short years to
serve, better fed and better clad than their fellows at home, found life
on a Virginia plantation no sweet or easy thing; the political and
ecclesiastical offenders enjoyed it still less, while the small criminal
class found their punishment quite sufficiently severe.  To this man the
life must be a slow _peine fort et dure_, breaking his body with toil,
crushing his soul with a hopeless degradation.  The thought of escape
must be ever present with him.  But escape in the conventional manner,
through pathless forests and over broad streams, was a thing rarely
attained to.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred failed; and the last state of
the man who failed was worse than his first.

Landless strode over to the table, and leaned his weight upon it.

""Listen!"" he said.  ""God knows I am a desperate man!  My attempt to
escape failing, there is naught but his word between me and the deepest
pool of these waters.  I am no saint.  I hate my enemies.  Restore to me
my sword, pit me against them one by one, and I will fight my way to
freedom or die....  A fair fight, too, a rising of the people against
oppression; a challenge to the oppressor to do his worst; a gallant
leading of a forlorn hope.... But a slave insurrection! a midnight
butchery!  There was one who used to tell me tales of such risings in
the Indies.  Murder and rapine, fire rising through the night, planters
cut down at their very thresholds, shrieking women tortured, children
flung into the flames,—a carnival of blood and horror!""

""We are not in the Indies,"" said the other quietly. ""There will be no
such devil’s work here.  Sit down and listen while I put the thing
before you as it is. There are, most iniquitously held as slaves in this
Virginia, some four hundred Commonwealth’s men, each one of whom, at
home and in his own station, was a man of mark.  Many were Ironsides.
And each one is a force in himself,—cool, determined, intrepid,—and
wholly desperate.  With them are many victims of the Act of Uniformity,
godly men, eaten up with zeal.  For their freedom they would dare much;
for their faith they would spill every drop of their blood.""

""They are like our friend, the Muggletonian, fanatics all, I suppose,""
said Landless.

""Possibly.  Your fanatic is the best fighting machine yet invented.  Do
you not see that these two classes form a regiment against which no
trainbands, no force which these planters could raise, would stand?""

""But they are scattered, dispersed through the colony!""

""Ay, but they can be brought together!  And to that end, seeing how few
there are upon any one plantation, upon the day when they rise, they
must raise with them servants and slaves.  Then will they overpower
masters and overseers, and gathering to one point, form there a force
which will beat down all opposition.  It is simple enough.  We will but
do that which it was proposed to do ten years ago.  You know the
instructions given by the Parliament to the four commissioners?""

""They were to summon the colony to surrender to the Commonwealth.  If it
did so, well and good; if not, war was to be declared, and the servants
invited to rise against their masters and so purchase their freedom.""

""Precisely.  Berkeley submitted, and there was no rising.  This time
there will be no summons, but a rising, and a very great one.  It will
be, primarily, a rising of four hundred Oliverians, strong to avenge
many and grievous wrongs; but with them will rise servants and slaves,
and to the banner of the Commonwealth, beneath which they will march,
will flock every Nonconformist in the land, and, when success is
assured, then will come in and give us weight and respectability those
(and they are not a few) of the better classes who long in their hearts
for the good days of the Commonwealth, and yet dare not lift a finger to
bring them back.""

""And the royalists?""

""If they resist, their blood be upon them!  But there shall be no
carnage, no butchery.  And if they submit they shall be unmolested, even
as they were ten years ago.  There is land enough for all.""

""The servants and slaves?""

""They that join with us, of whatever class, shall be freed.""

""This insurrection is actually in train?""

""Let us call it a revolution.  Yes, it is in train as far as regards the
Oliverians.  We have but begun to sound servants and slaves.""

""And you?""

""I am, for lack of a better, General to the Oliverians.""

""And you believe yourself able to control these motley forces,—men
wronged and revengeful, fanatics, peasants, brutal negroes, mulattoes
(whom they say are devils), convicts,—to say to them, ’Thus far must you
go, and no farther.’  You invoke a fiend that may turn and rend you!""

Godwyn shaded his eyes with his hand.  ""Yes,"" he said at last, speaking
with energy.  ""I do believe it! I know it is a desperate game; but the
stake!  I believe in myself.  And I have four hundred able adjutants,
men who are to me what his Ironsides were to Oliver, but none—"" he
stretched out his hand, thin, white, and delicate as a woman’s, and laid
it upon the brown one resting upon the table.  ""Lad,"" he said in a
gravely tender voice, ""I have none upon this plantation in whom I can
put absolute trust.  There are few Oliverians here, and they are like
Win-Grace Porringer, in whom zeal hath eaten up discretion. Lad, I need
a helper!  I have spoken to you freely; I have laid my heart before you;
and why?  Because I, who was and am a gentleman, see in you a gentleman,
because I would take your word before all the oaths of all the peasant
servants in Virginia, because you have spirit and judgment; because,—in
short, because I could love you as I loved your father before you.  You
have great wrongs.  We will right them together.  Be my lieutenant, my
confidant, my helper! Come! put your hand in mine and say, ’I am with
you, Robert Godwyn, heart and soul.’""

Landless sprang to his feet.  ""It were easy to say that,"" he said
hoarsely, ""for, in all the two years I lay rotting in prison, and in
these weeks of sordid misery here in Virginia, yours is the only face
that has looked kindly upon me, yours the only voice that has told me I
was believed....  But it is a fearful thing you propose!  If all go as
you say it will,—why WELL! but if not, Hell will be in the land.  I must
have time to think, to judge for myself, to decide—""

The door swung stealthily inward, and in the opening appeared the dead
white face, with the great letter sprawling over it, of Master Win-Grace
Porringer.

""There are boats on the creek.""  he said.  ""Two coming up, one coming
down.""

Godwyn nodded.  ""I hold conference to-night with men from this and the
two neighboring plantations. You will stay where you are and see and
hear them. Only you must be silent; for they must not know that you are
not entirely one with us, as I am well assured you will be.""

""They are Oliverians?""

""All but two or three.""

""I secured the mulatto,"" interrupted the Muggletonian.

""Ay,"" said Godwyn, ""I thought it well to have one slave representative
here to-night.  These mulattoes are devils; but they can plot, and they
can keep a still tongue.  But I shall not trust him or his kind too
far.""

The peculiar knock—four strokes in all—sounded upon the door, and
Porringer went to it.  ""Who is there?"" passed on the one side, and ""The
sword of the Lord and of Gideon"" on the other.  The door swung open, and
there entered two men of a grave and determined cast of countenance.
Both had iron-gray hair, and one was branded upon the forehead with the
letter that appeared upon the cheek of the Muggletonian.  Again the
knock sounded, the countersign was given, and the door opened to admit a
pale, ascetic-looking youth, with glittering eyes and a crimson spot on
each cheek, who stooped heavily and coughed often.  He was followed by
another stern-faced Commonwealth’s man, and he in turn by a brace of
broad-visaged rustics and a smug-faced man, who looked like a small
shop-keeper.  After an interval came two more Oliverians, grim of eye,
and composed in manner.

Last of all came the mulatto of the pale amber color and the gold
ear-rings; and with him came the long-nosed, twitching-lipped convict in
whose company Landless had crossed the Atlantic.  His name was Trail;
and Landless, knowing him for a villainous rogue, started at finding him
amongst the company.

His presence there was evidently unexpected; Godwyn frowned and turned
sharply upon the mulatto.  ""Who gave you leave to bring this man?"" he
demanded sternly.

The mulatto was at no loss.  ""Worthy Señors all,"" he said smoothly,
addressing himself to the company in general.  ""This Señor Trail is a
good man, as I have reason to know.  Once we were together in San
Domingo, slave to a villainous cavalier from Seville.  With the help of
St. Jago and the Mother of God, we killed him and made our escape. Now,
after many years, we meet here in a like situation.  I answer for my
friend as I answer for myself, myself, Luiz Sebastian, the humble and
altogether-devoted servant of you all, worshipful Señors.""

The man with the branded forehead muttered something in which the only
distinguishable words were, ""Scarlet woman,"" and ""Papist half-breed,""
and the smug-faced man cried out, ""Trail is a forger and thief!  I
remember his trial at the Bailey, a week before I signed as storekeeper
to Major Carrington.""

This speech of the smug-faced man created something of a commotion, and
one or two started to their feet.  The mulatto looked about him with an
evil eye.

""My friend has been in trouble, it is true,"" he said, still very
smoothly.  ""He will not make the worse conspirator for that.  And why,
worthy Señors, should you make a difference between him and one other I
see in company?  Mother of God! they are both in the same boat!""  He
fixed his large eyes on Landless as he spoke, and his thick lips curled
into a tigerish smile.

Landless half rose, but Godwyn laid a detaining hand upon his arm.  ""Be
still,"" he said in a low voice, ""and let me manage this matter.""

Landless obeyed, and the mender of nets turned to the assembly, who by
this time were looking very black.

""Friends,"" he said with quiet impressiveness, ""I think you know me,
Robert Godwyn, well enough to know that I make no move in these great
matters without good and sufficient reason.  I have good and sufficient
reason for wishing to associate with us this young man,—yea, even to
make him a leader among us.  He is one of us—he fought at Worcester.
And that he is an innocent man, falsely accused, falsely imprisoned,
wrongfully sent to the plantations, I well believe,—for I will believe
no wrong of the son of Warham Landless.""

There was a loud murmur of surprise through the room, and one of the
Oliverians sprung to his feet, crying out, ""Warham Landless was my
colonel!  I will follow his son were he ten times a convict!""

Godwyn waited for the buzz of voices to cease and then calmly proceeded,
""As to this man whom Luiz Sebastian hath brought with him, I know
nothing. But it matters little.  Sooner or later we must engage his
class,—as well commence with him as with another.  He will be faithful
for his own sake.""

The dark faces of his audience cleared gradually. Only the youth with
the hectic cheeks cried out, ""I have hated the congregation of evil
doers, and I will not sit with the wicked!"" and rose as if to make for
the door.  Win-Grace Porringer pulled him down with a muttered, ""Curse
you for a fool!  Shall not the Lord shave with a hired razor?  When
these men have done their work, then shall they be cut down and cast
into outer darkness, until when, hold thy peace!""

The company now applied itself to the transaction of business.  Trail
was duly sworn in, not without a deal of oily glibness and unnecessary
protestation on his part.  The man who held the little, worn Bible now
turned to Landless, but upon Godwyn’s saying quietly, ""I have already
sworn him,"" the book was returned to the bosom of its owner.

Each conspirator had his report to make.  Landless listened with grave
attention and growing wonder to long lists of plantations and the
servant and slave force thereon; to news from the up-river estates, and
from the outlying settlements upon the Rappahannock and the Pamunkey,
and from across the bay in Accomac; to accounts of secret arsenals
slowly filling with rude weapons; to allusions to the well-affected
sailors on board those ships that were likely to be in harbor during the
next two months;—to the details of a formidable and far-reaching
conspiracy.

The Oliverians spoke of the hour in which this mine should be sprung as
the great and appointed day of the Lord, the day when the Lord was to
stretch forth his hand and smite the malignants, the day when Israel
should be delivered out of the hand of Pharaoh. The branded man
apostrophized Godwyn as Moses. Their stern and rigid features relaxed,
their eyes glistened, their breath came short and thick.  Once the youth
who had wished to avoid the company of the wicked broke into hysterical
sobbing.  The two rustics spoke little, but possibly thought the more.
To them the day of the Lord translated itself the day of their obtaining
a freehold.  The smug-faced shopkeeper put in his oar now and again, but
only to be swept aside by the torrent of Biblical quotation. The newly
admitted Trail kept a discreet silence, but used his furtive greenish
eyes to good purpose.  Luiz Sebastian sat with the stillness of a great,
yellow, crouching tiger cat.

Godwyn heard all in silence.  Not till the last man had had his say did
he begin to speak, approving, suggesting, directing, moulding in his
facile hands the incongruous and disjointed mass of information and
opinion into a rounded whole.  The men, listening to him with breathless
attention, gave grim nods of approval.  At one point of his discourse
the branded man cried out:—

""If the Puritan gentry you talk of would gird themselves like men, and
come forth to the battle, how quickly would the Lord’s work be done!
They are the drones within the hive!  They expect the honey, but do not
the work.""

""It is so,"" said Godwyn, ""but they have lands and goods and fame to
lose.  We have naught to lose—can be no worse off than we are now.""

""If the Laodicean, Carrington,""—began the branded man.

Godwyn interrupted him.  ""This is beside the matter.  Major Carrington
is a godly man who hath, though in secret, done many kindnesses to us
poor prisoners of the Lord.  Let us be content with that.""

A moment later he said, ""It waxeth late, friends, and loath would I be
for one of you to be discovered. Come to me again a week from to-night.
The word will be, ’The valley of Jehoshaphat.’""

The conspirators dropped away, in twos and threes gliding silently off
in their stolen boats between the walls of waving grass.  When, last of
all save Landless and the Muggletonian, Trail and Luiz Sebastian
approached the door, Godwyn stopped them with a gesture.

""Stay a moment,"" he said.  ""I have a word to say to you.  We may as well
be frank with you.  I distrust you, of course.  It is natural that I
should. And you distrust me as much.  It is natural that you should.  I
would do without the aid of you and the class you represent if I could,
but I cannot.  You would do without my aid if you could, but you cannot.
Betray me, and whatever blood money you get, it will not be that freedom
which you want.  We are obliged to work together, unequal yoke-fellows
as we are.  Do I make myself understood?""

""To a marvel, Señor,"" said Luiz Sebastian.

""Damn my soul, but you ’re a sharp one!"" said Trail.

Godwyn smiled.  ""That is enough, we understand one another.
Good-night.""

The two glided off in their turn, and Godwyn said to the Muggletonian,
""Friend Porringer, that mended sail must be bestowed in the large boat
before the hut against Haines’ coming for it in the morning.  Will you
take it to the boat for me?  And if you will wait there this young man
shall join you shortly.""

The Muggletonian nodded, piled the heap of dingy sail upon his head and
strode off.  The mender of nets turned to Landless.

""Well,"" he said.  ""What do you think?""

""I think,"" said Landless, raising his voice, ""that the gentleman in the
dark corner must be tired of standing.""

There was a dead silence.  Then a piece of shadow detached itself from
the other heavy shadows in the dark corner and came forward into the
torch light, where it resolved itself into a handsome figure of a man,
apparently in the prime of life, and wearing a riding cloak of green
cloth and a black riding mask. Not content with the concealment afforded
by the mask, he had pulled his beaver low over his eyes and with one
hand held the folds of the cloak about the lower part of his face.  He
rested the other ungloved hand upon the table and stared fixedly at
Landless. ""You have good eyes,"" he said at last, in a voice as muffled
as his countenance.

""It is a warm night,"" said Landless with a smile. ""If Major Carrington
would drop that heavy cloak, he would find it more comfortable.""

The man recoiled.  ""You know me!"" he cried incredulously.

""I know the Carrington arms and motto.  _Tenax et Fidelis_, is it not?
You should not wear your signet ring when you go a-plotting.""

The Surveyor-General of the Colony dropped his cloak, and springing
forward seized Landless by the shoulders.

""You dog!"" he hissed between his teeth, ""if you dare betray me, I ’ll
have every drop of your blood lashed out of your body!""

Landless wrenched himself free.  ""I am no traitor,"" he said coldly.

Carrington recovered himself.  ""Well, well,"" he said, still breathing
hastily, ""I believe you.  I heard all that passed to-night, and I
believe you.  You have been a gentleman.""

""Had I my sword, I should be happy to give Major Carrington proof,"" said
Landless sternly.

The other smiled.  ""There, there, I was hasty, but by Heaven! you gave
me a start!  I ask your pardon.""

Landless bowed, and the mender of nets struck in. ""I was sorry to keep
you so long, Major Carrington, in such an uncomfortable position.  But
the arrival of the Muggletonian before he was due, together with your
desire for secrecy, left me no alternative.""

""I surmise, friend Godwyn, that you would not have been sorry had this
young man proclaimed his discovery in full conclave,"" said Carrington
with a keen glance.

Godwyn’s thin cheek flushed, but he answered composedly, ""It is
certainly true that I would like to see Major Carrington committed
beyond withdrawal to this undertaking.  But he will do me the justice to
believe that if, by raising my finger, I could so commit him, I would
not do so without his permission.""

""Faith, it is so!"" said the other, then turned to Landless with a stern
smile.  ""You will understand, young man, that Miles Carrington never
attended, nor will attend, a meeting wherein the peace of the realm is
conspired against by servants.  If Miles Carrington ever visits Robert
Godwyn, servant to Colonel Verney, ’t is simply to employ him (with his
master’s consent) in the mending of nets, or to pass an idle hour
reading Plato, Robert Godwyn having been a scholar of note at home.""

""Certainly,"" said Landless, answering the smile. ""Major Carrington and
Master Godwyn are at present much interested in the philosopher’s pretty
but idle conception of a Republic, wherein philosophers shall rule, and
warriors be the bulwark of the state, and no Greek shall enslave a
fellow Greek, but only outer barbarians—all of which is vastly pretty on
paper—but they agree that it would turn the world upside down were it
put into practice.""

""Precisely,"" said Carrington with a smile.

""You had best be off, lad,"" put in Godwyn.  ""Woodson is an early riser,
and he must not catch you gadding....  You will think on what you have
heard to-night, and will come to me again as soon as you can make
opportunity?""

""Yes,"" said Landless slowly.  ""I will come, but I make no promises.""

He found Porringer seated in their boat, patiently awaiting him.  They
cast off and rowed back the way they had come through the stillness of
the hour before dawn.  The tide being full, the black banks had
disappeared, and the grass, sighing and whispering, waved on a level
with their boat.  When they slid at last into the broader waters of the
inlet, the stars were paling, and in the east there gleamed a faint rose
tint, the ghost of a color.  A silver mist lay upon land and water, and
through it they stole undetected to their several cabins.

Meanwhile the two men, left alone in the hut on the marsh, looked one
another in the face.

""Are you sure that he can be trusted?"" demanded Carrington.

""I would answer for his father’s son with my life.""

""What of these scruples of his?  Faith! an unusual conjunction—a convict
and scruples!  Will you manage to dispose of them?""

Godwyn smiled with wise, sad eyes.  ""Time will dispose of them,"" he said
quietly.  ""He is new to the life.  Let him taste its full bitterness.
It will plead powerfully against his—scruples.  He has as yet no special
and private grievance.  Wait until he gets into trouble with Woodson or
his master.  When he has done that and has taken the consequences, he
will be ours.  We can bide our time.""




                             *CHAPTER VIII*

                          *THE NEW SECRETARY*


    ""Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind
      That, from the nunnery
    Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,
      To war and arms I flee....

    ""Yet this inconstancy is such
      As you too shall adore.
    I could not love thee, dear, so much,
      Loved I not honor more.""


The rich notes rang higher and higher, filling the languid air, and
drowning the trill of the mockingbirds. Patricia, filling her apron with
midsummer flowers, sang with a careless passion, her mind far away in
the midst of a Whitehall pageant, described to her the night before by
that silver-tongued courtier, Sir Charles Carew.

Still singing, she went up the steps of the porch and into the cool wide
hall.  In her face there was a languorous beauty born of the sunshine
outside; a soft color glowed in her cheeks, her eyes were large and
dreamy, little damp tendrils of gold strayed about her temples.  She
threw down her hat, and loosened the kerchief of delicate lawn from
about her warm young throat; then, with the flowers still in her arms,
she raised the latch of the door of a room held sacred to Colonel
Verney, and entered, to find herself face to face with the convict,
Godfrey Landless, who sat at a table covered with papers, busily
writing.

She started violently, and the mass of flowers fell to the floor,
shattering the petals from the roses and poppies.  Landless came
forward, knelt down, and, picking them up, restored them to her without
a word.

""I thank you,"" she said coldly.  ""I thought my father was here.""

""Colonel Verney is in the next room, madam.""

She moved to the door leading into the great room with the gait of a
princess, and Landless went back to his work.

Colonel Verney, on his knees before the richly carven chest containing
his library, looked up from the two score volumes to behold a mass of
brilliant blooms transferred from two white arms to the ground outside
the open window.

""Well, sweetheart,"" he said.  ""What is it?""

""Papa,"" she said, coming to his side, and looking down upon him with a
vexed face: ""you promised me that you would employ no more convicts in
the house.""

""Why, so I did, my dear,"" answered her father, comfortably seating
himself upon ""Purchas: His Pilgrimmes.""  ""And I meant to keep my word,
but this is the way of it.  The day after you went to Rosemead with
Betty Carrington, down comes young Shaw with the fever, and has to be
sent home to his mother. His illness came at a precious inconvenient
season, for the gout was in my fingers again, and I was bent on
disappointing William Berkeley, who hath wagered a thousand pounds of
sweet scented that my ’Statement of the Evil Wrought by the Navigation
Laws to His Majesty’s Colony of Virginia’ won’t be finished in time for
the sailing of the God-Speed.  So I told Woodson to find me some one
among the men who knew how to write.  He brought me this fellow, and I
vow he is an improvement on young Shaw.  He does n’t ask questions, and
he is a very pretty Latinist. The paper will be finished to-day.  I was
but searching for a neat quotation to close with.  Then the fellow will
go back to the tobacco, and you will be no longer annoyed by his
presence in the house.  Now kiss me, sweet chuck, and begone, for I am
busied upon affairs of state.""

Left alone, Colonel Verney pored over his books until he found what he
wanted, when, after rearranging his library in the carved chest, he rose
stiffly to his feet, and went into the next room and up to the
writing-table.  Landless rose from his seat, and, resigning it to his
master, stood gravely by while the Colonel looked over the manuscript
upon which he had been employed.

""Ha!"" said the Colonel.  ""A very fair copy!  You have numbered and
headed the pages, I observe.  Let me see, let me see, let me see,"" and
he ran them over between his fingers.  ""Oppressive Nature of the
Act.—Grave Dissatisfaction.—It advantageth No One save Small Traders at
Home.—Increase of Revenue to His Majesty if ’t were repealed.—Dutch
Bottoms.—Trade with Russia.—His Majesty’s Poor Planters Throw Themselves
upon His Majesty’s Mercy.  Very good, very good!""

""It is nigh finished, sir,"" said Landless.

""Ay, ay!  By the Lord Harry, William Berkeley will repent his wager!  A
pretty paper it is, and containeth many excellent points and much good
Latin, and you have copied it fairly and cleanly.  It is a pity, my
man,"" he added not unkindly, ""that you should have lived so evilly as to
bring yourself to this pass, for you have in you the making of an
excellent secretary.""

""Is it your will, sir, that I finish the copy now?""

""Yes, but take it to the small table within the window there.  I myself
will sit here and jot down some ideas for my dedication which you can
afterwards amplify.""

The worthy colonel pulled the big Turkey worked chair closer to the
table, turned back his ruffles and fell to work.  Landless retired to
the table within the window, and for a while naught was heard in the
quiet room but the scratching of quills, as master and man drove them
across the whitey-brown sheets.

At length the master pushed his chair back and stretched himself with a
prodigious yawn.  ""The Lord be thanked!"" he said, addressing the air.
""That’s done!  And it is time to see to the dressing of that sore upon
Prince Rupert’s shoulder; and I remember Haines said that one of the
hounds had been gored by Carrington’s bull.  Haines can’t dress a wound.
Haines is a bungler.  But, by the Lord Harry!  Richard Verney is as good
a veterinary as he is a statesman.""

He lifted his burly figure from the depths of the chair, and going over
to Landless, dropped upon the table before him a page of hieroglyphics
for him to decipher at his leisure.  Then with another word of
commendation for the beauty of the copy, he walked heavily from the
room.  A moment later Landless heard him whistle to his dogs, and then
break into a stave of a cavalier drinking song, sung at the top of a
full manly voice, and dying away in the direction of the stables.

Landless’ hand moved to and fro across the paper with a tireless
patience.  He did not go back to the central table, for the light was
better in the window, and a vagrant breath of air strayed in now and
then. The window was a deep one, and heavy drugget curtains hung between
it and the rest of the room.

The door opened and a man’s voice said: ""This room is darkened into
delicious coolness.  Shall we try it, cousin?""

Patricia entered like a sunbeam, and after her sauntered Sir Charles
Carew, languid, debonair, and perfectly appareled.

Landless, seeing them plainly, did not realize that in the shadow of the
heavy curtains he was himself unseen.  He had grown so accustomed to the
quiet insolence that overlooks the presence of an inferior as it does
that of any other article of furniture, that he did not doubt that the
fine lady and gentleman before him were perfectly aware of the presence
in the room of the slave whom his master’s caprice had raised for the
moment to the post of secretary.  It was some few minutes before he
began to consider within himself that he might be mistaken.




                              *CHAPTER IX*

                        *AN INTERRUPTED WOOING*


Sir Charles pushed forward the big chair for Patricia, and himself
dropped upon a stool at her feet. Taking her fan from her, he began to
play with it, lightly commenting on the picture of the Rape of Europa
with which it was adorned.  Suddenly he closed it, tossed it aside, and
leaning forward, possessed himself of her hand.

""Madam, sweet cousin, divinest Patricia,"" he exclaimed in a carefully
impassioned tone; ""do you not know that I am your slave, the captive of
your bow and spear, that I adore you?  I adore you! and you,
flinty-hearted goddess, give no word of encouragement to your prostrate
worshiper.  You trample upon the offering of sighs and tears which he
lays at your feet; you will not listen when he would pour into your ear
his aspirations towards a sweeter and richer life than he has ever
known.  Will it be ever thus?  Will not the goddess stoop from her
throne to make him the happiest of mortals, to win his eternal
gratitude, to become herself forever the object of the most respectful,
the most ardent, the most devoted love?""

He flung himself upon his knee and pressed her hand to his heart with
passion not all affected.  He had come to consider it a piece of
monstrous good luck, that, since he must make a wealthy match,
Providence (or whatever as a Hobbist he put in place of Providence),
had, in pointing him the fortune, pointed also to Patricia Verney.  But
the night before, in the privacy of his chamber, he had suddenly sat up
between the Holland sheets with a startled and amused expression upon
his handsome face, swathed around with a wonderful silken night-cap, and
had exclaimed to the carven heads surmounting the bed-posts, ""May the
Lard sink me! but I ’m in love!"" and had lain down again with an
astonished laugh.  While sipping his morning draught he made up his mind
to secure the prize that very day, in pursuance of which determination
he made a careful toilet, assuming a suit that was eminently becoming to
his blonde beauty. Also his valet slightly darkened the lower lids of
his eyes, thereby giving him a larger, more languishing and melancholy
aspect.

Patricia, from the depths of the Turkey worked chair, gazed with calm
amusement upon her kneeling suitor.

""You talk beautifully, cousin,"" she said at length. ""’Tis as good as a
page from ’Artemène.’""

Sir Charles bit his lip.  ""It is a page from my heart, madam; nay, it is
my heart itself that I show you.""

""And would you forsake all those beautiful ladies who are so madly in
love with you?—I vow, sir, you told me so yourself!  Let me see, there
was Lady Mary and Lady Betty, Mistress Winifred, the Countess of —— and
Madame la Duchesse de ——.  Will Corydon leave all the nymphs lamenting
to run after a little salvage wench who does not want him?""

""’S death, madam! you mock me!"" cried the baronet, starting to his feet.

""Sure, I meant no harm, cousin; I but put in a good word for the poor
ladies at Whitehall.  I fear that you are but a recreant wooer.""

""Will you marry me, madam?"" demanded Sir Charles, standing before her
with folded arms.

She slowly shook her head.  ""I do not love you, cousin.""

""I will teach you to do so.""

""I do not think you can,"" she said demurely. ""Though I am sure I do not
know why I do not. You are a very fine gentleman, a soldier and a
courtier, witty, brave and handsome—and this match""—a sigh—""is my
father’s dearest wish.  But I do not love you, sir, and I shall not
marry you until I do.""

""Ah!"" cried Sir Charles, and sunk again upon his knee.  ""You give me
hope!  I will teach you to love me!  I will exhibit towards you such
absolute fidelity, such patient devotion, such uncomplaining submission
to your cruel probation, that you will perforce pity me, and pity will
grow by soft degrees into blessed love.  I do not despair, madam!""  He
pressed her hand to his lips and cast his fine eyes upward in a killing
look.

Patricia gave a charming laugh.  ""As you please, Sir Charles.  In the
mean time let us be once more simply good friends and loving cousins.
Tell me as much as you please of Lady Mary’s charms, but leave Patricia
Verney’s alone.""

Sir Charles rose from his knees, smarting under an amazed sense of
failure, and very angry with the girl who had discarded him, Charles
Carew, as smilingly as if he had been one of the very provincial youths
whom he awed into awkward silence every time they came to Verney Manor.
Without doubt she deserved the condign punishment which it was in his
power to inflict by sailing away upon the next ship which should leave
for England.  But he was now obstinately bent upon winning her.  If not
to-day, to-morrow; and if not to-morrow, the next day; and if not that,
the day after.  He was of the school of Buckingham and Rochester.  He
could devote to the capture of a woman all the tireless energy, the
strategic skill, the will, the patience, the daring, of a great general.
He could mine and countermine, could plan an ambuscade here, and lead a
forlorn hope there, could take one intrenchment by storm, and another by
treachery. And victory seldom forsook her perch upon his banners.

Life in Virginia was pleasant enough, and he could afford to devote
several months to this siege.  As to how it would terminate he had not
the slightest doubt. But just now it was the course of wisdom to retreat
upon the position held yesterday, and that as quickly as possible.  So
he smoothed his face into a fine calm, modulated his voice into its
usual tone of languor, and said with quiet melancholy:—

""You are pleased to be cruel, madam.  I submit. I will bide my time
until that thrice happy day when you will have learnt the lesson I would
teach, when Love, tyrannous Love, shall compel your allegiance as he
does mine.""

""A far day!"" said Patricia with soft laughter. ""You had best return to
Lady Mary.  I do not think that I shall ever love.""

She lifted her white arms, and clasping them behind her head, gazed at
him with soft, bright, untroubled eyes and smiling lips.  The sunlight,
filtering through the darkened windows in long bright stripes, laid a
shaft of gold athwart her shoulder and lit her hair into a glory.  From
out the distance came the colonel’s voice:—

    ""In his train see sweet Peace, fairest Queen of the sky,
    Ev’ry bliss in her look, ev’ry charm in her eye.
    Whilst oppression, corruption, vile slav’ry and fear
    At his wished for return never more shall appear.
      Your glasses charge high, ’tis in great Charles’ praise,
      In praise, in praise, ’tis in great Charles’ praise.""


Some one outside the door coughed, and then rattled the latch
vigorously.  These precautions taken, the door was opened and there
appeared Mistress Lettice, gorgeously attired, and with an extra row of
ringlets sweeping her withered neck, and a deeper tinge of vermilion
upon her cheeks,—for she had waked that morning with a presentiment that
Mr. Frederick Jones would ride over in the course of the day.  Sir
Charles rose to hand her to a chair, but she waved him back with a thin,
beringed hand.

""I thank you, Sir Charles: but I will not trouble you.  I am going down
to the summer-house by the road, as I think the air there will cure my
migraine. Patricia, love, I am looking for my ’Clelie,’—the fourth
volume.  Have you seen it?""

""No, Aunt Lettice.""

""It is very strange,"" said Mrs. Lettice plaintively. ""I am sure that I
left it in this room.  ’T is that careless slut of a Chloe who deserves
a whipping. She hides things away like a magpie.""

""Look in the window; you may have left it there,"" said Patricia.

Mrs. Lettice approached the window, laid a hand upon the curtain, and
started back with a scream.

""What is it, madam?"" cried the baronet.

""’T is a man! a horrid, horrid man hiding there, waiting to cut all our
throats in the dead of night as the Redemptioner did to the family at
Martin-Brandon! Oh!  Oh!  Oh!"" and Mrs. Lettice threw her apron over her
head, and sank into the nearest chair. Patricia started up.  Sir
Charles, striding hastily towards the window, his hand upon his sword,
was met by the emerging figure of Landless.

The two gazed at each other, Sir Charles’ first haughty surprise fast
deepening into passion as he remembered that the man before him had
assisted at the scene of a while before, had witnessed his discomfiture,
had seen him upon his knees, baffled, repulsed, even laughed at!

He was the first to speak.  ""Well, sirrah,"" he said between his teeth,
""what have you to say for yourself?""

""That I ask your pardon,"" said Landless steadily. ""I should have made
known my presence in the room.  But at first I thought you aware of it;
and when I discovered that you were not, I ... it seemed best to remain
silent.  I was wrong.  I should have made some sign even then.  Again, I
beg your pardon.""  He turned to Patricia, who stood, tall, straight, and
coldly indignant, beside the chair from which she had risen.  ""Madam,""
he said in a voice that faltered, despite himself, ""I crave your
forgiveness.""

She bit her coral under lip, and looked at him from under veiled
eyelids.  It was a cruel look, very expressive of scorn, abhorrence, and
perhaps of fear.

""My father hath many unmannerly servants,"" she said coldly and clearly,
""who often provoke me.  But I pardon them because they know no better.
It seems that like allowance cannot be made for you. However,"" she
smiled icily, ""I shall not complain of you to my father, which assurance
will doubtless content you.""

Landless turned from burning red to deadly white. His eyes, fixed upon
the floor, caught the rich shimmer of her skirts as she moved towards
the door; a moment and she was gone, leaving the two men facing each
other.

Between them there existed a subtle but strong antagonism.  Sir Charles
Carew, courtier in a coarse and shameless court masquerading under a
glittering show of outward graces, had taken lazy delight in heaping
quiet insults upon the man who could not resent them. This amusement had
beguiled the tedium of the Virginia voyage; and when chance threw them
together upon a Virginia plantation, where life flowed on in one long,
placid lack of variety, the sport became doubly prized.  It had to be
pursued at longer intervals, but pursued it was.  Heretofore the
amusement had been all upon one side; now, Sir Charles felt a chagrined
suspicion that it was he who had afforded the entertainment.
Simultaneously with arriving at this conclusion he arrived at a point
where he was coldly furious.

Landless returned his look coolly and boldly.  He considered that he had
made quite sufficient apology for an offense which was largely
involuntary, and he was in no mood for further abasement.

""You are an insolent rascal,"" said the baronet smoothly.

Landless smiled.  ""Sir Charles Carew should be a good judge of
insolence.""

Sir Charles took a leisurely pinch of snuff, shook the fallen grains
from his ruffles, snapped the lid of the box, looked languishingly at
the miniature that adorned it, replaced the box in his pocket, and
remarked, ""Well, I am waiting!""

""And for what?""

""To hear your petition that I forbear to bring this matter to the notice
of your master.  The lady mercifully gave you her promise.  I suppose I
must follow so fair an example.""

""Sir Charles Carew may wait till doomsday to hear that or any other
request made by me to him or to the lady—who does not seem always
mercifully inclined—"" he broke off with a slight and expressive smile.

Sir Charles took another pinch of snuff.  ""May the Lard blast me,"" he
drawled, ""if they do not teach repartee at Newgate!  But I forget that
the tongue is the only weapon of women and slaves.""

""Some day I hope to teach you otherwise.""

The other laughed.  ""So the slave thinks he can use a sword?  Where did
he learn?  In Newgate, from some broken captain, as payment for
imparting the trick of stealing by the Book?""

Landless forced himself to stand quiet, his arms folded, his fingers
tightly clenching the sleeves of his coarse shirt.  ""Shall I tell Sir
Charles Carew where I first used my sword with good effect?"" he said in
an ominously quiet voice.  ""At Worcester I was but a stripling, but I
fought by the side of my father.  I remember that, young as I was, I
disabled a very pretty perfumed and ringleted Cavalier.  I think he was
afterwards sold to the Barbadoes.  And my father praised my sword play.""

""Your father,"" said the other, bringing his strong white teeth together
with a click.  ""Like father, like son.  The latter a detected rogue,
gaol-bird, and slave; the former a d—d canting, sniveling Roundhead
hypocrite and traitor, with a text ever at hand to excuse parricide and
sacrilege.""

Landless sprang forward and struck him in the face.

He staggered beneath the weight of the blow; then, recovering himself,
he whipped out his rapier, but presently slapped it home again.  ""I am a
gentleman,"" he said, with an airy laugh.  ""I cannot fight you.""  And
stood, slightly smiling, and pressing his laced handkerchief to his
cheek whence had started a few drops of blood.

Mrs. Lettice, whom curiosity or the search for the fourth volume of
""Clelie"" had detained in the room, screamed loudly as the blow fell; and
Colonel Verney, appearing at the door, stopped short, and stared from
one to the other of the two men.




                              *CHAPTER X*

                       *LANDLESS PAYS THE PIPER*


The hut of the mender of nets stood upon a narrow isthmus connecting two
large tracts of marsh. That to the eastward was partially submerged at
high tide; that to the west, being higher ground, waved its long grass
triumphantly above the reaching waters. Upon this side the marsh was
separated from the mainland of forest and field by a creek so narrow
that the great pines upon one margin cast their shadows across to the
other, and one fallen giant quite spanned the sluggish waters.

The grass of this marsh was annually cut for hay; for though the great
herds of cattle belonging to the different plantations roamed at large
through all seasons of the year, seeking their sustenance from forest or
marsh, the more provident of the planters were accustomed to make some
slight provision against the winter, which might prove a severe one with
snow and ice.

It was late afternoon, and the hay was cut.  The half dozen mowers threw
themselves down upon the stubble, stretching out tired limbs and
pillowing heated foreheads upon their arms.  They had been given until
sunset to do the work.  Having no taskmaster over them, and being hid
from the tobacco-fields by a convenient coppice of pine and cedar, they
had set to work in a fury of diligence, had cut and stacked the grass in
a race with time, and now found themselves possessed of a precious hour
in which to dawdle, and swap opinions and tobacco before the sunset horn
should call them to quarters.

Three were indented servants, lumbering, honest-visaged youths whose
aims in life were simple and well defined.  Their creed had but four
articles: ""Do as little as you can consistently with keeping out of the
overseer’s black books; get your full share of loblolly and bacon, and
some one else’s if you are clever enough; embrace every opportunity for
reasonable mischief that is offered you; honor Church and King, or say
you do, and Colonel Verney will overlook most pranks.""  Of the others,
one was the Muggletonian, one the mulatto, Luiz Sebastian, and one a
convict, not Trail, but the red-haired, pock-marked, sullen wretch who
had come to the plantation with Trail and Landless, and whose name was
Roach.

One of the rustics, who seemed more intelligent than his fellows, and
who had a good-humored deviltry in his young face and big blue eyes,
began an excellent imitation of Dr. Nash’s exhortation to submission and
obedience delivered upon the last instruction day for servants, and soon
had his audience of two guffawing with laughter.  The mulatto and the
convict edged by imperceptible degrees farther and farther away from the
others, until, within the shadow of a stack of grass, they lay side by
side and commenced a muttered conversation.  The countenance of the
white man, atrocious villainy written large in every lineament, became
horribly intent as his amber-hued companion talked in fluent low tones,
emphasizing what he had to say by a restless, peculiar, and sinister
motion of his long, yellow fingers.  At a little distance lay the
Muggletonian, his elbows on the ground, his ghastly face in his hands,
and his eyes riveted upon the Geneva Bible which he had drawn from his
bosom.

When he had brought his entertainment to a finish, the blue-eyed youth
rolled himself over and over the stubble to where the Muggletonian lay,
intent upon a chapter of invective.  The youth covered the page with one
enormous paw and playfully attempted to insert the little finger of the
other into the hole in Porringer’s ear.  ""What now, old Runaway,"" he
said, lazily, ""hunting up fresh curses to pour on our unfort’net heads?""

""Cursed be he who makes a mock of age,"" said the Muggletonian, grimly.
""May he be even as the wicked children who cried to the prophet, ’Go up,
thou baldhead!’""

The boy laughed.  ""Tell me when you see brown bear a-coming,"" quoth he.
""Losh! a bear steak would taste mighty good after eternal bacon!""

Porringer closed his book and restored it to his bosom.  ""Tell me,"" he
said, abruptly, ""have you seen aught of the young man called Landless?""

""’The young man called Landless,’"" answered the other, petulantly, ""has
a d—d easy berth of it! Yesterday evening I carried water from the
spring to the great house to water Mistress Patricia’s posies, and every
time I passes the window of the master’s room I see that fellow
a-sitting at his ease in a fine chair before a fine table, writing away
as big as all out of doors.  And every time I says to him, says I, ’I
reckon you think yourself as fine as the Lord Mayor of London?  A pretty
sec’tary you make!’""

""Have you seen him to-day?""

""No, I have n’t seen him to-day,—but I see someone else.  Mates,"" he
exclaimed, ""Witch Margery’s coming down t’ other side of creek.  I ’ll
call her over.""

Scrambling to his feet he gave a low halloo through his hands, ""Margery!
Margery!  Come and find the road to Paradise!""

Margery waved her hand to signify that she heard and understood, and
presently stepped upon the fallen tree that spanned the stream.  It was
a narrow and a slippery bridge, but she flitted across it with the
secure grace of some woodland thing, and, staff in hand, advanced
towards the men.  Between them and the western sun she stood still, a
dark figure against a halo of gold light, and threw an intent and
searching glance over the unbroken green of the marsh and the blue of
the waters beyond.  Then with a wild laugh she came up to them and cast
her staff wreathed with dark ivy upon the ground.

""The road is not here,"" she cried.  ""Here is all green grass, and beyond
is the weary, weary, weary sea!  There is no long, bright, shining road
to Paradise.""  She sat down beside her staff, and taking her chin into
her hand, stared fixedly at the ground.

The men gathered around her, with the exception of the Muggletonian,
who, after audibly comparing her to the Witch of Endor, turned on his
side and drew his cap over his eyes as if to shut out the hated sight.
The convict took up the staff and began to pull from it the strings of
ivy.

""Put it down!"" she said quickly.

The man continued to strip it of its leafy mantle.

""Put it down, can’t you?"" said the youth.  ""She never lets any one touch
it.  She says an angel gave it to her to help her on her way.""

With a snarling laugh the convict threw it from him with all his force.
Whirling through the air it struck the water midway from shore to shore.
Margery sprang to her feet with a loud cry.  The boy rose also.

""D—n you!"" he said, wrathfully.  ""I’d like to break it over your
misshapen back!  Here, Margery, don’t fret.  I ’ll get it for you.""

He ran to the bank, dived into the water, and in three minutes was back
with the dripping mass in his arms.  He gave it into Margery’s hands,
saying kindly while he shook himself like a large spaniel; ""There! it is
n’t hurt a mite!""

With a cry of delight Margery seized the ""angel’s gift"" and kissed the
hand that restored it.  Then she turned upon the convict.

""When I go back to my cabin in the woods,"" she said, solemnly, and with
her finger up, ""I shall whistle all the fairy folk into a ring, all the
elves and the pixies, and the little brown gnomes who burrow in the
leaves and look for all the world like pine cones, and I shall tell them
what you did, and to-night they will come to your cabin, and will pinch
you black and blue, and stick thorns into you, and rub you with the
poison leaf until you are blotched and swelled like the great bull frog
that croaks, croaks, in these marshes.""

There was an uneasy ring in the convict’s laugh, full of bravado as he
meant it to be.  Margery continued with an ominously extended
forefinger.  ""And then they will fly to the great house where the master
lies sleeping, and they will whisper to him that you took away the
angel’s gift from poor, lost Margery, and he will be angry, for he is
good to Margery, and to-morrow he will make Woodson do to you what he
did to-day to the Breaking Heart.""

""To the Breaking Heart!"" exclaimed her auditors.

Margery nodded.  ""Yes, the Breaking Heart.  You call him Landless.""

The Muggletonian sat up.  ""What dost thou mean, wretched woman! fit
descendant of the mother of all evil?""

Margery, offended by his tone, only pursed up her lips and looked wise.

""What did the master have done to Landless, Margery?"" asked the youth.

Margery threw her worn figure into a singular posture. Standing
perfectly straight, she raised her arms from her sides and spread them
stiffly out, the hands turned inward in a peculiar fashion.  Then, still
with extended arms, she swayed slightly forward until she appeared to
lean against, or to be fastened to, some support.  Next she threw her
head back and to one side, so that her face might be seen in three
quarter over her shoulder.  Her mobile features wreathed themselves in
an expression of pain and rage.  Her brows drew downward, her thin lips
curled themselves away from the gleaming teeth, and, at intervals of
half a minute or more, her eyelids quivered, she shuddered, and her
whole frame appeared to shrink together.

The pantomime was too expressive to be misunderstood by men each of whom
had probably his own reasons for recognizing some one or all of its
features. The convict broke into a yelling laugh, in which he was
joined, though in a subdued and sinister fashion, by Luiz Sebastian.
The rustics looked at each other with slow grins of comprehension, and
the blue-eyed youth uttered a long shrill whistle.  The great letter
upon the cheek of the Muggletonian turned a deeper red, and his eyes
burned.  The youth was curious.

""Tell us all about it, Margery,"" he said, coaxingly, ""and when the
millons are ripe, I ’ll steal you one every night.""

Margery was nothing loth.  She had attained the reputation of an
accomplished _raconteuse_, and she was proud of it.  Her crazed
imagination peopled the forest with weird uncanny things, and fearful
tales she told of fays and bugaboos, of spectres and awful voices
speaking from out the dank stillness of twilight hollows.  Often she
sent quaking to their pallets men who would have heard the war-whoop
with scarcely quickened pulses.  And she could tell of every-day
domestic happenings as well as of the doings of the powers of darkness.

Her audience listened greedily to the instance of plantation economy
which she proceeded to relate.

""When was this, woman?"" demanded the Muggletonian, when she had
finished.

Margery pointed to the declining sun and then upwards to a spot a little
past the zenith.

""Just after the nooning,"" said the Muggletonian, and began to curse.

Margery stood up, her staff in her hand, and said airily, ""Margery must
be going.  The sun is growing large and red, and when he has slipped
away behind the woods, the voices will begin to call to Margery from the
hollow where the brook falls into the black pool.  She must be there to
answer them.""  She moved away with a rapid and gliding step, flitted
across the fallen tree, and was lost to sight in the shadow of the pines
beyond.

As the last flutter of her light robe vanished, a figure appeared,
walking rapidly along the opposite margin of the creek.  The youth’s
sight was keen.  He sent a piercing glance across the intervening
distance and broke into an astonished laugh.  ""Lord in Heaven! it’s the
man himself!"" he cried in an awed tone. ""Ecod! he must be made of iron!""

Landless crossed the bridge and came towards the staring group.  His
face was white and set, and there were dark circles beneath his eyes,
which had the wide unseeing stare of a sleep-walker.  He walked lightly
and quickly, with a free, lithe swing of his body.  The men looked at
one another in rough wonder, knowing what was hidden by the coarse
shirt.  He passed them without a word, apparently without knowing that
they were there, and went on towards the hut of the mender of nets.
Presently they saw him enter and shut the door.

The rustics and the convict, after one long stare of amazement at the
distant hut, began to comment freely and with much recondite blasphemy
upon the transaction recorded by Margery.  Luiz Sebastian only smiled
amiably, like a lazy and well-disposed catamount, and the boy whistled
long and thoughtfully. But the countenance of Master Win-Grace Porringer
wore an expression of secret satisfaction.




                              *CHAPTER XI*

                    *LANDLESS BECOMES A CONSPIRATOR*


As Landless entered the hut Godwyn looked up with a pleased smile from
the net he was mending. The two men had not seen each other since the
night upon which Landless had been brought to the hut by the
Muggletonian.  Twice had Landless laid his plans for a second visit,
only to be circumvented each time by the watchfulness of the overseer.

The smile died from Godwyn’s face as he observed his visitor more
closely.

""What is it?"" he asked quickly.

Landless came up to him and held out his hand. ""I am with you, Robert
Godwyn, heart and soul,"" he said steadily.

The mender of nets grasped the hand.  ""I knew you would come,"" he said,
drawing a long breath. ""I have needed you sorely, lad.""

""I could not come before.""

""I know: Porringer told me you were prevented. I—""  He still held
Landless’ hand in both his own, and as he spoke his slender fingers
encircled the young man’s wrist.

""What is the matter with your pulse?"" he demanded. ""And your eyes!  They
are glazing!  Sit down!""

""It is nothing,"" said Landless, speaking with effort.

""I have been a physician, young man,"" retorted the other.  ""Sit down, or
you will fall.""

He forced him down upon a settle from which he had himself risen, and
stood looking at him, his hand upon his shoulder.  Presently his glance
fell to the shoulder, and he saw upon the white cloth where his hand
pressed it against the flesh, a faint red stain grow and spread.

The face of the mender of nets grew very dark. ""So!"" he said beneath his
breath.

He limped across the hut and drew from some secret receptacle above the
fireplace a flask, from which he poured a crimson liquid into an earthen
cup; then hobbled back to Landless, sitting with closed eyes and head
bowed upon the table.

""Drink, lad,"" he said with grave tenderness.  ""’T is a cordial of mine
own invention, and in the strength it gave me I fled from Cropredy
Bridge though woefully hacked and spent.  Drink!""

He held the cup to the young man’s lips.  Landless drained it and felt
the blood gush back to his heart and the ringing in his ears to cease.
Presently he raised his head.  ""Thank you,"" he said.  ""I am a man
again.""

""How is it that you are here?""

Landless smiled grimly.  ""I imagine it’s because Woodson thinks me
effectually laid by the heels. When he goes the rounds at supper time he
will be surprised to find my pallet empty.""

""You must be in quarters before then.  You must not get into further
trouble.""

""Very well,"" was the indifferent reply.

They were silent for a few moments, and then Landless spoke.

""I am come to tell you, Master Godwyn, that I will join in any plan,
however desperate, that may bring me release from an intolerable and
degrading slavery.  You may use me as you please.  I will work for you
with hands and head, ay, and with my heart also, for you have been kind
to me, and I am grateful.""

The mender of nets touched him softly upon the hand.  ""Lad,"" he said, ""I
once had a son who was my pride and my hope.  In his young manhood he
fell at the storming of Tredah.  But the other night when I talked with
you, I seemed to see him again, and my heart yearned over him.""

Landless held out his hand.  ""I have no father,"" he said simply.

""Now,"" at length said Godwyn, ""to business!  I must not keep you now,
but come to me to-morrow night if you can manage it.  You may speak to
Win-Grace Porringer, and he will help you.  I will then tell you all my
arrangements, give you figures and names, possess you, in short, with
all that I, and I alone, know of this matter.  And my heart is glad
within me, for though my broken body is tied to my bench here, I shall
now have a lieutenant indeed.  I have conceived; you shall execute.  The
son of Warham Landless, if he have a tithe of his father’s powers, will
do much, very much.  For more than a year I have longed for such an
one.""

""Tell me but one thing,"" said Landless, ""and I am content.  You have so
planned this business that there shall be no wanton bloodshed?  You
intend no harm, for instance, to the family yonder?"" with a motion of
his head towards the great house.

""God forbid!"" said the other quickly.  ""I tell you that not one woman or
innocent soul shall suffer. Nor do I wish harm to the master of this
plantation, who is, after the lights of a Malignant, a true and kindly
man, and a gentleman.  This is what will happen.  Upon an appointed day
the servants, Oliverian, indented and convict, upon all the plantations
seated upon the bay, the creeks, the three rivers, and over in Accomac,
will rise.  They will overpower their overseers and those of their
fellows who may remain faithful to the masters, will call upon the
slaves to follow them, and will march (the force of each plantation
under a captain or captains appointed by me), to an appointed place in
this county.  All going well, there should be mustered at that place
within the space of a day and a night a force of some two thousand
men—such an army as this colony hath never seen, an army composed in
large measure of honest folk, and officered by four hundred men who,
bold and experienced, and strong in righteous wrath, should in
themselves be sufficient to utterly deject the adversary.  We will make
of that force, motley as it is, a second New Model, as well disciplined
and as irresistible as the first; and who should be its general but the
son of that Warham Landless whom Cromwell loved, and whose old regiment
is well represented here?  Then will we fight in honest daylight with
those who come against us—and conquer.  And we will not stain our
victory.  Your nightmare vision of midnight butchery is naught.  There
will be no such thing.""

Through the quiet of the evening came to them the clear, sweet, and
distant winding of a horn.

""’Tis the call to quarters,"" said Godwyn.  ""You must go, lad.""

Landless rose.  ""I will come to-morrow night if I can.  Till then,
farewell,—father.""  He ended with a smile on his dark, stern face that
turned it into a boy’s again.

""May the Lord bless thee, my son,"" said the other in his gravely tender
voice.  ""May he cause His face to shine upon thee, and bring thee out of
all thy troubles.""

As Landless turned to leave the hut the mender of nets had a sudden
thought.  ""Come hither,"" he said, ""and let me show you my treasure
house.  Should aught happen to me, it were well that you should know of
it.""

He took up the precious flask from the table, and followed by Landless,
limped across the hut to the fireplace.  The logs above it appeared as
solid, gnarled and stained by time as any of the others constituting the
walls of the hut, but upon the pressure of Godwyn’s finger upon some
secret spring, a section of the wood fell outwards like the lid of a
box, disclosing a hollow within.

From this hollow came the dull gleam of gold, and by the side of the
little heap of coin lay several folded papers and a pair of handsomely
mounted pistols.

Godwyn touched the papers.  ""The names or the signs of the Oliverians
are here,"" he said, ""together with those of the leaders of the indented
servants concerned with us.  It is our solemn League and Covenant—and
our death warrant if discovered.  The gold I had with me, hidden upon my
person, when I was brought to Virginia.  The pistols were the gift of a
friend.  Both may be useful some day.""

""Hide them!  Quick!"" said Landless in a low voice, and wheeled to face a
man who stood in the doorway, blinking into the semi-darkness of the
room.

The lid of the hollow swung to with a click, the log assumed its wonted
appearance, and the mender of nets, too, turned upon the intruder.

It was the convict Roach who had pushed the door open and now stood with
his swollen body and bestial face darkening the glory of the sunset
without.  There was no added expression of greed or of awakened
curiosity upon his sullenly ferocious countenance. He might have seen or
he might not.  They could not tell.

""What do you want?"" asked Landless sternly.

""Thought as you might not have heard the horn, comrade, and so might get
into more trouble.  So I thought I ’d come over and warn you.""  All this
in a low, hoarse and dogged voice.

""Don’t call me comrade.  Yes: I heard the horn. You had best hasten or
you may get into trouble yourself.""

The man received this intimation with a malevolent grin.  ""Talking big
eases the smart, don’t it?"" and he broke into his yelling laugh.

""Get out of this,"" said Landless, a dangerous light in his eyes.

The man stopped laughing and began to curse. But he went his way, and
Landless, too, after waiting to give him a start, left the hut and
turned his steps towards the quarters.

Upon the other side of the creek, sitting beneath a big sweet gum, and
whittling away at a piece of stick weed, he found the boy who, the day
before, had accused him of feeling as fine as the Lord Mayor of London.
He sprang to his feet as Landless approached, and cheerfully remarking
that their paths were the same, strode on side by side with him.

""I say,"" he said presently with ingenuous frankness, ""I asks your pardon
for what I said to you yesterday.  I dessay you make a very good
Sec’tary, and Losh! the Lord Mayor himself might n’t have dared to
strike that d—d fine Court spark.  They say he has fought twenty duels.""

""You have my full forgiveness,"" said Landless, smiling.

""That’s right!"" cried the other, relieved.  ""I hates for a man to bear
malice.""’

""I have seen you before yesterday.  I forget how they call you.""

""Dick Whittington.""

""Dick Whittington!""

""Ay.  Leastways the parish over yonder,"" a jerk of his thumb towards
England, ""called me Dick, and I names myself Whittington.  And why?
Because like that other Dick I runs away to make my fortune. Because
like him I ’ve little besides empty pockets and a hopeful heart.  And
because I means to go back some fine day, jingling money, and wearing
gold lace, and become the mayor of Banbury.  Or maybe I ’ll stop in
Virginia, and become a trader and Burgess.  I could send for Joyce
Witbread, and marry her here as well as in Banbury.""

Landless laughed.  ""So you ran away?""

""Yes; some four years ago, just after I came to man’s estate.""  (He was
about nineteen.)  ""Stowed myself away on board the Mary Hart at
Plymouth. Made the Virginny voyage for my health, and on landing was
sold by the captain for my passage money. Time ’s out in three years,
but I may begin to make my fortune before then, for—""  He stopped
speaking to give Landless a sidelong glance from out his blue eyes, and
then went on.

""A voice speaks through the land, from the Potomac to the James, and
from the falls of the Far West to the great bay.  What says the voice?""

Landless answered, ""The voice saith, ’Comfort ye, my people, for the
hour of deliverance is at hand.’""

""It ’s all right!"" cried the boy gleefully.  ""I thought you was one of
us.  We are all in the fun together!""

""We are in for a desperate enterprise that may hang every man of us,""
said Landless sternly.  ""I do not see the ’fun,’ and I think you talk
something loudly for a conspirator.""

The boy was nothing abashed.  ""There’s none to hear us,"" he said.  ""I
can be as mum as t’ other Dick’s cat when there are ears around.  As for
fun, Losh! what better fun than fighting!""

""You seem to have a pretty good time as it is.""

""Lord, yes!  Life ’s jolly enough, but you see there ’s mighty little
variety in it.""

""I have found variety enough,"" said Landless.

""Oh, you ’ve been here only a few weeks.  Wait until you’ve spent years,
and have gone through your experience of to-day half a dozen times, and
you will find it tame enough.""

""I shall not wait to see.""

""Then a man gets tired of working for another man, and hankers for the
time when he can set up for himself, especially if there ’s a pretty
girl waiting for him.""  A tremendous sigh.  ""And then there ’s the fun
of the rising.  Losh! a man must break loose now and then!""

""For all of which good reasons you have become a conspirator?""

""Ay, it does n’t pay to run away.  You are hunted to death in the first
place, and well nigh whipped to death if you are caught, as you always
are.  And then they double your time.  This promises better.""

""If it succeeds.""

""Oh, it will succeed!  Why should n’t it with old Godwyn, who is more
cunning than a red fox or a Nansemond medicine-man, at its head?
Besides, if it fails, hanging is the worst that can happen, and we will
have had the fun of the rising.""

""You are a philosopher.""

""What’s that?""

""A wise man.  Tell me: If this plot remains undiscovered, and the rising
actually takes place, there will be upon each plantation before we can
get away an interval of confusion and perhaps violence.  ’T is then that
the greatest danger will threaten the planters and their families.  You
yourself have no ill feeling towards your master or his family?  You
would do them no unprovoked mischief?""

The boy opened his big blue eyes, and shook his head in a vehement
negative.

""Lord bless your soul, no!"" he cried.  ""I would n’t hurt a hair of
Mistress Patricia’s pretty head, nor of Mistress Lettice’s wig, neither.
As for the master, if he lets us go peaceably, we ’ll go with three
cheers for him!  Bless you! they ’re safe enough!""

The sanguine youth next announced that he smelt bacon frying, and that
his stomach cried ""Trencher!"" and started off in a lope for the
quarters, now only a few yards distant.  Landless followed more
sedately, and reached his cabin without being observed by the overseer.




                             *CHAPTER XII*

                             *A DARK DEED*


Three weeks passed, weeks in which Landless saw the mender of nets some
eight times in all, making each visit at night, stealthily and under
constant danger of detection.  Thrice he had assisted at conferences of
the Oliverians from the neighboring plantations, who now, by virtue of
his descent, his intimacy with Godwyn, and his very apparent powers,
accepted him as a leader.  Upon the first of these occasions he had set
his case before them in a few plain, straightforward words, and they
believed him as Godwyn had done, and he became in their eyes, not a
convict, but, as he in truth was, an Oliverian like themselves, and a
sufferer for the same cause.  The remaining interviews had been between
him and Godwyn alone.  In the lonely hut on the marsh, beneath starlight
or moonlight, the two had held much converse, and had grown to love each
other.  The mender of nets, though possessed of a calm and high serenity
of nature that defied trials beneath which a weaker soul had sunk, was a
man of many sorrows; he had the wisdom, too, of years and experience,
and he sympathized with, soothed, and counseled his younger yoke-fellow
with a parental tenderness that was very grateful to the other’s more
ardent, undisciplined, and deeply wounded spirit.

Upon the night of their eighth meeting they held a long and serious
consultation.  Affairs were in such train that little remained to be
done, but to set the day for the rising, and to send notice by many
devious and underground ways to the Oliverian captains scattered
throughout the Colony.  Landless counseled immediate action, the firing
of the fuse at once by starting the secret intelligence which would
spread like wildfire from plantation to plantation. Then would the mine
be sprung within the week. There was nothing so dangerous as delay, when
any hour, any moment might bring discovery and ruin.

Godwyn was of a different opinion.  It was then August, the busiest and
most unhealthy season of the year, when the servants and slaves,
weakened by unremitting toil, were succumbing by scores to the fever. It
was the time when the masters looked for disaffection, when the
overseers were most alert, when a general watchfulness pervaded the
Colony.  The planters stayed at home and attended to their business, the
trainbands were vigilant, the servant and slave laws were construed with
a harshness unknown at other seasons of the year.  There were few ships
in harbor compared with the number which would assemble for their fall
lading a month later, and Godwyn counted largely upon the seizure of the
ships.  In a month’s time the tobacco would be largely in,—a weighty
consideration, for tobacco was money, and the infant republic must have
funds.  The ships would be in harbor, and their sailors ready for
anything that would rid them of their captains; the heat and sickness of
the summer would be abated; the work slackened, and discipline relaxed.
The danger of discovery was no greater now than it had been all along,
and the good to be won by biding their time might be inestimable.  The
danger was there, but they would face it, and wait,—say until the second
week in September.

Landless acquiesced, scarcely convinced, but willing to believe that the
other knew whereof he spoke, and conscious, too, that his own impatience
of the yoke which galled his spirit almost past endurance might incline
him to a reckless and disastrous haste.

It was past midnight when he rose to leave the hut on the marsh.  Godwyn
took up his stick.  ""I will walk with you to the banks of the creek,"" he
said.  ""’T is a feverish night, and I have an aching head.  The air will
do me good, and I will then sleep.""

The young man gave him his arm with a quiet, protecting tenderness that
was very dear to the mender of nets, and leaning upon it, he limped
through the fifty feet of long grass to the border of the creek.

""Shall I not wait to help you back?"" asked Landless.

""No,"" said the other, with his peculiarly sweet and touching smile.  ""I
will sit here awhile beneath the stars and say my hymn of praise to the
Creator of Night.  You need not fear for me; my trusty stick will carry
me safely back.  Go, lad, thou lookest weary enough thyself, and should
be sleeping after thy long day of toil.""

""I am loth to leave you to-night,"" said Landless.

Godwyn smiled.  ""And I am always loth to see you go, but it were selfish
to keep you listening to a garrulous, wakeful old man, when your young
frame is in sore need of rest.  Good-night, dear lad.""

Landless gave him his hands.  ""Good-night,"" he said.

He stood below the other at the foot of the low bank to which was moored
his stolen boat.  Godwyn stooped and kissed him upon the forehead.  ""My
heart is tender to-night, lad,"" he said.  ""I see in thee my Robert.
Last night I dreamed of him and of his mother, my dearly loved and
long-lost Eunice, and ah!  I sorrowed to awake!""

Landless pressed his hand in silence, and in a moment the water widened
between them as Landless bent to his oars and the crazy little bark shot
out into the middle of the stream.  At the entrance of the first
labyrinthine winding he turned and looked back to see Godwyn standing
upon the bank, the moonlight silvering his thin hair and high serene
brow.  In the mystic white light, against the expanse of solemn heaven,
he looked a vision, a seer or prophet risen from beneath the sighing
grass.  He waved his hand to Landless, saying in his quiet voice, ""Until
to-morrow!""  The boat made the turn, and the lonely figure and the hut
beyond it vanished, leaving only the moonlight, the wash and lap of
water, and the desolate sighing of the marsh grass.

There were many little channels and threadlike streams debouching from
the main creek, and separated from it by clumps and lines of partially
submerged grass, growing in places to the height of reeds.  While
passing one of these clumps it occurred to Landless that the grass
quivered and rustled in an unusual fashion.  He rested upon his oars and
gazed at it curiously, then stood up, and parting the reeds, looked
through into the tiny channel upon the other side.  There was nothing to
be seen, and the rustling had ceased.  ""A heron has its nest there, or a
turtle plunged, shaking the reeds,"" said Landless to himself, and went
his way.

Some three hours later he was roused from the heavy sleep of utter
fatigue by the voice of the overseer.  Bewildered, he raised himself
upon his elbow to stare at Woodson’s grim face, framed in the doorway
and lit by the torch held by Win-Grace Porringer, who stood behind him.
""You there, you Landless!"" cried the overseer, impatiently.  ""You sleep
like the dead.  Tumble out!  You and Porringer are to go to Godwyn’s
after that new sail for the Nancy. Sir Charles Carew has taken it into
his head to run over to Accomac, and he ’s got to have a spick and span
white rag to sail under.  Hurry up, now!  He wants to start by sun up,
and I clean forgot to send for it last night.  You ’re to be back within
the hour, d’ye hear?  Take the four-oared shallop.  There’s the key,""
and the overseer strode away, muttering something about patched sails
being good enough for Accomac folk.

Landless and the Muggletonian stumbled through the darkness to the wharf
behind the quarters, where they loosed the shallop, and in it shot
across the inlet towards the mouth of the creek.

""I will row,"" said the Muggletonian with grim kindness; ""you look worn
out.  I suppose you were out last night?""

Landless nodded, and the other bent to the oars with a will that sent
them rapidly across the sheet of water.  A cold and uncertain light
began to stream from the ashen east, and the air was dank and heavy with
the thick mist that wrapped earth and water like a shroud.  It swallowed
up the land behind them, and through it the nearer marshes gloomed
indistinctly, dark patches upon the gray surface of the water.  The
narrow creek was hard to find amidst the universal dimness.  The
Muggletonian rowed slowly, peering about him with small, keen eyes.  At
length with a grunt of satisfaction he pointed to a pale streak dividing
two masses of gray, and had turned the boat’s head towards it, when
through the stillness they caught the sound of oars.  The next moment a
boat glided from the creek and began to skirt the shores of the inlet,
hugging the banks and moving slowly and stealthily.  It was still so
dark that they could tell nothing more than that it held one man.

""Now, who is that?"" said the Muggletonian. ""And what has he been doing
up that creek?""

""Hail him,"" Landless replied.

Porringer sent a low halloo across the water, but if the man heard he
made no sign.  The boat, one of the crazy dugouts of which every
plantation had store, held on its stealthy way, but being over close to
the bank presently ran upon a sand bar.  Its occupant was forced to rise
to his feet in order to shove it off. He stood upright but a moment, but
in that moment, and despite the partial darkness, Landless recognized
the misshapen figure.

""It is the convict, Roach!"" he exclaimed.

""Ay,"" said the Muggletonian, ""and an ill-omened night bird he is!  May
he be cursed from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head!  May
there be no soundness in him!  May—  What are you about, friend?"" he
cried, interrupting himself.  ""There ’s no need of two pair of oars.  We
have plenty of time.""

Landless bent to the second pair of oars.  ""He came down the creek,"" he
said in a voice that sounded strained and unnatural.

The other stared at him.  ""What do you mean?"" he demanded.

""Nothing: but let us hasten.""

Porringer stared, but fell in with the humor of his companion, and the
shallop, impelled by strong arms, shot into the creek and along its mazy
windings with the swiftness of a bird.

Landless rowed with compressed lips and stony face, a great fear tugging
at his heart.  Porringer too was silent.  The vapor hung so heavily upon
the plains of marsh level with their heads that they seemed to be
piercing a dense, low cloud.  The light was growing stronger, but the
earth still lay like a corpse, livid, dumb, cold and still.  There was a
chill stagnant smell in the air.

Arriving at the stake in the bank below the hut, they fastened the boat
to it, and stepping out, moved through the dense mist to where the hut
loomed indistinctly before them, looking in the blank and awful
stillness like a forlorn wreck drifting upon an infinite sea of
soundless foam.

""The door is open,"" said Landless.

""Ay, I see,"" answered Porringer.  ""Does he wish to die before his time
of the fever, that he lets this graveyard mist and stench creep in upon
him in his sleep?""

They spoke in low tones as though they feared to waken the sleeper whom
they had come to waken. When they reached the hut, they knocked upon the
lintel of the door and called Godwyn by name, once, twice, thrice.
There was no answer.

""Come on!"" said Landless hoarsely, and entered the hut, followed by the
other.  The cold twilight, filtering through the low and narrow doorway,
was powerless to dispel the darkness within.  Landless groped his way to
the pallet and stooped down.

""He is not here,"" he said.

The Muggletonian stumbled over a sheaf of oars, sending them to the
floor with a noise that in the utter stillness, and to their strained
ears, sounded appalling.

""It’s the darkness of Tophet,"" muttered Porringer. ""If I could find his
flint and steel; there are pine knots, I know, in the corner—God in
Heaven!""

""What is it?  What is the matter?"" cried Landless, as he staggered
against him.

""It’s his face!"" gasped the other.  ""There upon the table!  I put my
hand upon it.  It’s cold!""

Landless rushed to the fireplace where he knew the tinder-box to be
kept, and then groped for and found the heap of pine knots.  A moment
more and the fat wood was burning brightly, casting its red light
throughout the hut, and choking back the pale daylight.

The familiar room with its familiar furnishing of chest and settle and
pallet, of hanging nets and piles of dingy sail, sprung into sight, but
with it sprung into sight something unfamiliar, strange, and dreadful.

It was the body of the mender of nets, flung face upwards across the
rude table, the head hanging over the edge, and the face, which but a
few short hours before had looked upon Landless with such a bright and
patient serenity, blackened and distorted.  Upon the throat were dark
marks, the print of ten murderous fingers.

With a bitter cry Landless fell upon his knees beside the table, and
pressed his face against the cold hand flung backwards over the head of
the murdered man.  Porringer began to curse.  With white lips and
burning eyes he hurled anathemas at the murderer.  He cursed him by the
powers of light and darkness, by the earth, the sea, and the air: by all
the plagues of the two Testaments.  Landless broke the torrent of his
maledictions.

""Silence!"" he said sternly.  ""_He_ would have forgiven.""  Presently he
rose from the ground, and taking the body in his arms, placed it upon
the pallet, and reverently composed the limbs.  Then he turned to the
fireplace.  It was easy to see that the hiding-place had been visited.
The spring was broken, and the lid had been struck and jammed into place
by a powerful and hasty hand.  Landless wrenched it off. Before him lay
the pistols; but the gold and papers were gone.  He turned to the
Muggletonian, standing beside him with staring eyes.

""Listen!"" he said.  ""There was gold here.  The wretch whom we passed but
now knew of it—never mind how—and for it he has murdered the only friend
I had on earth.  There will come a day when I will avenge him.  There
were papers here, lists with the signatures of Oliverians,
Redemptioners, sailors,—of all classes concerned in this undertaking,
save only the slaves and the convicts.  There were letters from Maryland
and New England, and a correspondence which would provide whipping-post
and pillory for other Nonconformists than the Quakers.  All these, the
actual proofs of this conspiracy, are in his—that
murderer’s—hands,—where they must not stay.""

""What wilt thou do, friend?"" said the Muggletonian eagerly.  ""Wilt thou
take the murderer aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smite
him under the fifth rib, as did Joab to Abner the son of Ner, who slew
his brother Asahel?""

""God forbid,"" said Landless.  ""But I will take them from him before he
knows their contents.  One moment, and we will go.""

He crossed to the pallet and stood beside it, looking down on the shell
that lay upon it with a stern and quiet grief.  One of the cold white
hands was clenched upon something.  He stooped, and with difficulty
unclasped the rigid fingers.  The something was a ragged lock of coarse
red hair.

""You see,"" he said.

""Ay,"" said the Muggletonian grimly.  ""It’s evidence enough.  There ’s
but one man in this county with hair like that.  Leave that lock where
it is, and that dead man holds the rope that will hang his murderer.""

""It shall be left where it is,"" said Landless, and reclosed the fingers
upon it.

He took a piece of sail-cloth from the floor, and with it covered the
dead man from sight.  Next he turned to the hollow above the fireplace,
and took from it the pistols, concealing them in his bosom. ""I may need
them,"" he said.  ""Come.""

They left the hut and its dead guardian, and rowed back through the
summer dawn.  The sky was barred with crimson and gold, the fiery rim of
the sun just lifting above the eastern waters, the mist, a bridal veil
of silver and pearl drawn across the face of a virgin earth.

They rowed in silence until they neared the wharf, when Porringer said,
""You are leader now.""

The other raised his haggard eyes.  ""It is a trust. I will go through
with it, God helping me.  But I would I were lying dead beside him in
yonder hut.""

They left the boat at the wharf, and went towards the quarters.  Meeting
one of the blowzed and slatternly female servants, Landless asked where
they might find the overseer.  He had gone to the three-mile field half
an hour ago, after bestowing upon the two dilatory servants a hearty
cursing, and promising to reckon with them at dinner-time.  ""Where was
the master?""  He had gone to the mouth of the inlet with Sir Charles
Carew, who had grown impatient, and had sailed away under the Nancy’s
patched sail. The under overseer was in the far corn-field, two miles
off.

""Are all the men in the fields, Barb?"" asked Landless.

Barb informed him that they were, ""as he might very well know, seeing
that the sun was half an hour high.""

""Have you seen the man called Roach?""

No: Barb had not seen him; but she had heard the overseer tell Luiz
Sebastian to take two men and go to the strip of Orenoko between the
inlet and the third tobacco house, and Luiz Sebastian, had been calling
for Roach and Trail.

Landless thanked her, and moved away without offering to bestow upon her
that which Barb probably thought her information merited.

""Do you find Woodson,"" he said to the Muggletonian, ""and report this
murder, saying nothing, however, of what we know.  I myself will go to
the tobacco house.""

""Had I not best come with thee to hold up thy hands?"" said Porringer.
""I would take up my text from the thirty-fifth of Numbers, and from
Revelation, twenty-second, thirteen, and deal mightily with the
murderer.""

""No,"" answered Landless.  ""Woodson must be seen at once, or we ourselves
will fall under suspicion. And, friend, ask that thou and I may be the
ones to bury _him_.""




                             *CHAPTER XIII*

                         *IN THE TOBACCO HOUSE*


The third tobacco house was built upon a point of land jutting into the
larger inlet, and screened off from the wide expanse of fields by a belt
of cedars. It was a lonely, retired spot, and the high, dark, windowless
structure with its heavy, low-browed door had a menacing aspect.
Landless expected to find the men within the building, instead of
outside attending to their work, and he was not disappointed.  As he
walked through the doorway into the pungent gloom the three started up
from the débris of casks, sticks, and pegs, amidst which they had been
squatting, with their heads ominously close together.

Landless strode up to Roach.  ""You murderer!"" he said.

The convict recoiled; then with a bestial sound, half snarl, half bellow
of rage, he gathered himself for a rush.  Landless awaited him with bent
body and sinewy, outstretched arms; but the mulatto interposed. Laying
his long, beautifully shaped, yellow hands upon Roach, he forced him
back against a cask, and, pinning him there, whispered in his ear.  The
face of the wretch gradually resumed its usual expression of low
brutality, though an ugly sweat broke out upon it, and the mouth opened
and shut as though he had been running.  He turned upon Landless with a
half threatening, half cringing air.

""So you ’ve found out what I was about last night, eh, pardner?  But you
’ll keep a still tongue.  You ’re not one to peach on your comrade as
was in hell or Newgate with you, and as crossed the ocean with you to
this d—d Virginia, and as has always liked you, and has the same spite
as you have against the man what bought us.  You say naught, comrade,
and you ’ll not stand to lose by it.""

""I go from here to give you up to Colonel Verney,"" said Landless.

The wretch gave a snarl of rage and fear.  Luiz Sebastian laid a
soothing hand upon his shoulder.

""If I thought that,"" snarled the convict, ""you ’d never live to reach
that door.""

""I shall live to see you hanged,"" said the other coolly.

Here the mulatto slipped something into Roach’s hand.  ""So you ’ll give
me up?"" said the latter in a peculiar voice.

""I have said so.""

""Then, by the Lord!  I ’ll be even with you!"" Roach cried with savage
triumph.  ""Do you see this, and this, and this?"" fluttering a mass of
folded papers before the other’s eyes.  ""Ah!  I was wise, I was, when I
could n’t hide everything about me, to take the papers, and leave the
weapons.  I ’ve got you now.  Here ’s the lists that the old fool who is
dead and gone to hell had hidden behind the gold!  Here ’s enough to
hang you and your d—d Cromwellians higher than Haman.  There will be
more than one giving up, I ’m thinking!  I ’ve got you under my thumb,
and I ’ll squeeze you!""

""You cannot read; you do not know what those papers contain,"" said
Landless steadily.

""But I can,"" put in Trail smoothly.  ""I was but just running them over
to our friend whose education has been so sadly neglected, when you came
in.""

Landless drew a pistol from his bosom, cocked it, and leveled it at the
murderer.  ""You see,"" he said with an ominously quiet eye and voice,
""you were not altogether wise to leave the weapons.  Now, give me those
lists.""

""Damnation!"" cried the convict, and Luiz Sebastian glided towards the
door.

Landless, quick of eye and active of body, saw the movement, and sprang
backwards to the opening before the other could reach it.  He covered
the three with his pistol.

""I will shoot the first of you that stirs,"" he said sternly.  ""You,
Roach, lay those papers upon that bit of board, and push them towards me
with your foot.""

""I ’ll go to hell first,"" was the sullen reply.

""As you please.  I will give you until I count twenty.  If those papers
are not in my hands, then I will shoot you like the dog you are.""

The murderer uttered a dreadful curse.  Landless began to count.  Roach
made an irresolute motion or the hand that held the lists.  Landless
counted on, ""fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—""  With another oath
and a grin of rage Roach dropped the papers upon the board at his feet.
""Now push it towards me,"" said Landless.

With a brow like midnight the other did as he was bid.  Still covering
his men, Landless stooped quickly, and took up the precious papers,
assured himself that they were all there, and placed them in his bosom.

""Now,"" he said, leaning his back against the door-post, and regarding
the three baffled rogues with a grim eye, ""I have a few words to say to
you.  I speak first to you, Trail, and to you, Luiz Sebastian. These
papers have told you little that you did not know before.  It was not
the information that you gained from them that made them so valuable; it
was the possession of them, the possession of actual proofs of this
conspiracy which you might hold over our heads, or, if the notion took
you, might sell to Colonel Verney?""

""Señor Landless sees the thing as it is,"" said Luiz Sebastian.

""Well, you no longer possess these proofs, and are therefore just where
you were yesterday.""

""Listen, Señor Landless,"" said Luiz Sebastian gloomily.  ""This plot does
not please us.  It is too much in the hands of those who call themselves
soldiers and martyrs, whom our master calls fanatic Oliverians, and whom
I, Luiz Sebastian, call accursed heretics.  The servants have no say in
the matter; they are to follow like sheep where these others lead. The
slaves are not even to know of it until the last moment.  A handful of
us who have white blood in our veins are let into the secret, that we
may incite the blacks when the time is come; but are we consulted? Are
our opinions asked, our wishes deferred to?  I, Luiz Sebastian, who have
been through three insurrections in the Indies, and who know how such
things should be managed; has my advice been craved as to this or that?
You make us promises.  Mother of God! how do we know that those promises
will be kept?  By St. Jago! the insurrection may arrive, and the
planters be put down, and next year may find us slaves still, with but a
change of masters!""

""It is too late now for such questions,"" said Landless steadily.  ""You
must accept the conspiracy as it is.  In liberating themselves, these
men will of necessity free you even as they will free me, who am not, as
you know, of their class.  I shall take my chance, as I think you will
take yours.""

The mulatto played with a tobacco peg, striking it against his great,
white teeth.  At length he said slowly and with a sinister upward glance
at the figure by the door, ""Certainly, Señor Landless, it seems our
best, our only chance, for freedom.""

And with this Landless had perforce to be content. He turned to the
murderer, saying sternly, ""Now for my word with you.  I hold your life
in my hands, for I heard you last night in the marsh, and Porringer and
I saw you stealing from the creek this morning, and I can swear that you
knew of the gold hidden in the hut.  You have it on you at this moment.
I could hold you here with this pistol until the overseer should come
and search you.  But I let you go, choosing rather your safety than the
endangerment of that which was dearer than life to the man you murdered.
The unsupported assertion of a murderer as to the contents of papers
which he had not got to show, might not go for much, but I prefer that
you should not make it.  I have warned you;—you had best make your
escape at once.""

""If you hold your tongue, there ’s no reason why I should run.""

""Oh, yes, there is!  There is a reason in the hut on the marsh.""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean that clasped in the hand of the man you murdered is the missing
half of that torn lock upon your forehead.""

With a yell Roach sprang to the door only to be confronted by the muzzle
of Landless’ pistol.

""Wait a moment,"" he said composedly.  ""Oh, you need not be afraid!  I
intend to let you go.  But you don’t leave this tobacco house until
after I have left it myself.""

""Curse you!"" cried the other, foaming at the lips.

""You are ungrateful.  I not only promise not to witness against you, but
I aid you to escape.""

""For reasons of your own,"" suggested Trail.

""Precisely: for reasons of my own.  If you are taken, I will hold my
tongue just so long as you hold yours.  If you escape now, I will pray
that my day of reckoning will yet come.  And it will be a heavy
reckoning.""

""Ay, that it will!"" cried the murderer with brutal fury.  ""You ’ve got
the upper hand now: but wait! Every dog has his day, and I ’ll have
mine! and when it comes, I ’ll do for you!  I ’ll smash your beauty! I
’ll draw more blood from you than ever the whip of the overseer did!  I
’ll use you worse than I used that old man last night, who writhed and
struggled, and tried to pray!  I ’ll—""

With white lips and blazing eyes Landless sprang forward, and clapped
the mouth of the pistol to the ruffian’s temple.  Roach recoiled, then
sunk upon his knees with an abject whine for mercy.

Landless let his hand drop, and moved slowly back to the door.  ""You had
need to cry for mercy,"" he said in a low, distinct voice, ""for you were
never so near to death before.  I let you go now, but one day I shall
kill you.  Until which day—take care of yourself!""  Still with his face
upon them he passed out of the door, then turned and walked away with a
steady step, but with a heart bleeding for the loss of his friend, and
heavy with forebodings for the future.

In the tobacco house the murderer, the forger, and the mulatto sat
stricken into silence until the last crisp footfall had died away.  Then
amidst a torrent of curses Roach made for the door.  Trail plucked him
back.  ""Where are you going?"" he cried.

""I don’t know!  To the devil!""

""The bloodhounds will be upon your trail before noon.""

The wretch cried out and struck his hand against the wall with a force
that laid the knuckles bare and bleeding.

""There is a way,"" said Luiz Sebastian slowly, ""a way that only I know.
You must take to the inlet here, and swim up it until you come to the
mouth of the brook yonder in the forest.  You must wade up that brook
until you come to a second, and up that until you come to a third.  When
you have gone a mile up that one, leave it, and strike through the
woods, going towards the north.  Another mile will bring you to a
village of the Chickahominies upon the Pamunkey.[#]  They are at odds
with Governor and Council, and they will hide you.  Moreover, I once did
their sachem a service, and they are my friends.""


[#] The modern York.


""I ’m off,"" said Roach, breaking from the detaining grasp.

""Wait,"" said Luiz Sebastian.  ""There as time enough.  Woodson will not
come for a long while. When he does, he shall find Señor Trail and
myself busily at work there outside, and we will say that you left us,
and went down the inlet a long time before. But now we want to talk to
you.""

""Be quick then,"" growled the other, ""I ’ve no mind to swing for this
job.""

Luiz Sebastian brought his handsomely malevolent face close to the
other’s hideous countenance.

""Would you not like to ruin that devil who but now robbed you of your
hard-earned property?""

""Would I not?"" cried the murderer with a tremendous oath.  ""I ’d give
everything but life and gold to do it, as that cunning devil well knew.
I ’d give my soul!""

""Would you like to be shown how to get more gold than old Godwyn’s
store, twenty times told?  To get your freedom?  To have some black,
sweet hours in which to work your will on them at the house yonder? To
plunge your arms to the elbow in the master’s money chest, to become
drunken with his wine; to strike him down, and that smiling imp his
cousin, and that other devil, Woodson; to hear the women cry for
mercy—and cry in vain?  You would like all this?""

""Show me the way!"" cried the brute with a ferocious light in his
bloodshot eyes.  ""Show me the way to do it safely, and I ’ll—""  He broke
off and threatened the air with malignant fists.

""Go to the village on the Pamunkey,"" said Luiz Sebastian with his most
feline expression.  ""I will come to you there the first night I can slip
away, I and our friend, the Señor Trail.  There we will have our little
conference.  Mother of God!  Señor Landless may find that others can
plot as well as he and his accursed heretics.""




                             *CHAPTER XIV*

                        *A MIDNIGHT EXPEDITION*


Four nights later, the hour before midnight found Landless walking
steadily through the forest, bound upon a mission which he had had in
his mind since the night after the murder of Godwyn.  This was the first
night since that event upon which he had deemed it advisable to leave
the quarters, having no mind to be captured as a runaway by one of the
many search parties which were scouring the peninsula between the two
great rivers for the murderer of Robert Godwin.  But the search was now
trending northward towards Maryland, to which colony runaways usually
turned their steps, and he felt that he might venture.

There was little undergrowth in the primeval forest, and the rows of
vast and stately trees were as easy to thread as the pillared aisles of
a cathedral.  When he came to one of the innumerable streamlets that
caught the land in a net of silver, he removed his coarse shoes and
stockings, and waded it.  The great branches overhead shut in a night
that was breathlessly hot and still.  He could see the stars only when
he crossed the streams or emerged into one of the many little open
glades.  He walked warily, making no sound, and now and then stopping to
listen for the distant halloo, or bark of a dog, which might denote that
he was followed, or that there was a search party abroad, but he heard
nothing save the usual forest sounds,—the dropping of acorns, the
sighing leaves, the cry of some night bird,—sounds that seemed to make
the night more still than silence.

He was nearing his destination when from out a shadowy clump of alders,
standing upon the bank of the stream which he had just crossed, there
shot a long arm, and the next moment he was wrestling with a dark and
powerful figure whose naked body slipped from his hold as though it had
been greased.  But Landless, too, was strong and determined, and the two
swayed and strained backwards and forwards through the darkness, wary
and resolute, neither giving his antagonist advantage.  The hand of the
unknown writhed itself from the other’s clasp and stole downwards
towards his waist.  Landless felt the motion and intercepted it.  Then
the figure, with an angry guttural sound, began to put forth its full
strength. The arms encircled Landless with a slowly tightening iron
band; the great dark shoulder came forward with the force of a
battering-ram; the limbs twined like boa-constrictors around the limbs
of the other. Locked together, the two reeled into a little fairy glade,
where the short grass, pearled with dew, lay open to the moon.  Here,
borne backwards by the overwhelming force of his assailant, Landless
fell heavily to the ground.  The figure falling with him, pinned him to
the earth with its knee upon his breast. In the moonlight he saw the
gleam of the lifted knife.

He had had but time for a half-tittered, half-thought prayer when the
pressure upon his breast relaxed; the knife fell, indeed, but harmlessly
upon the grass, and the figure rose to its height with an astonished
""Ugh!""

Landless, rising also, began to think that he recognized the gigantic
form towering through the pale moonlight.

""Ugh!"" said the figure again.  ""The great Spirit threw us into the light
in time.  Monakatocka had been forever shamed had his knife drunk the
life of his friend.""

""Why did you set upon me?"" demanded Landless, still breathless from the
struggle, while the Indian was as calmly composed as upon the day of
their first meeting.

""Monakatocka took you for the man for whom they hunt with dogs through
the forest, scaring the deer from the licks and the partridge from the
fern.  Two nights ago Major Carrington said to Monakatocka, ’Find me
that man and kill him, and to the twenty arms’ length of roanoke which
the county will pay to Monakatocka, I will add a gun with store of
powder, and with a bullet for every stag between Werowocomico and
Machot.’  When he heard you a long way off, moving over the leaves,
trying to make no sound, Monakatocka thought he held the gun of the
pale-face Major in his hand.  But now—"" he waved his hand with a gesture
eloquent of resignation.

""I am sorry to disappoint you,"" said Landless, amused at his air of calm
regret.

""I am glad to have proved the strength of my brother,"" was the
sententious reply.  ""Where goes my brother through the woods, which are
full of danger to him to-night?  Or has he a pass?""

""I have business at Rosemead,"" answered Landless.  ""I am close to the
house, I think?""

The Indian pointed through the trees.  ""It lies twelve bowshots before
you.  The overseer with the dogs has gone to the great swamp to look for
the man with the red hair.""

""Thanks for the information, friend,"" said Landless. ""I ask you,
moreover, to say nothing of this encounter.  I have no pass.""

""I have but one friend,"" answered the Indian. ""His secret is my secret.""

""Are you, too, then, so lonely?"" asked Landless, touched by his tone.

""Listen,"" said the Indian, leaning his back against a great oak.  ""I
will tell my brother who I am.... Many years ago the Conestogas, they
whom the palefaces call the Susquehannocks, came down the great bay and
fought with the palefaces.  Monakatocka was then but a lad on his first
war-path.  Agreskoi was angry: he hid his face behind a cloud.  With
their guns the palefaces beat the Conestogas like fleeing women back to
their village on the banks of a great river, and themselves returned in
triumph to their board wigwams, bearing with them many captives.
Monakatocka, son to a great chief, was one.  The palefaces made him to
work like a squaw in their fields of tobacco and maize.  When he ran
away they put forth a long arm and plucked him back and beat him.
Agreskoi was angry, for Monakatocka had not any offering to make him.
One by one his fellow captives have dropped away like the leaves that
fall in the moon of Taquetock, until, behold! he is left alone.  The
palefaces are his enemies.  He thinks of the village beside the pleasant
stream, and he hates them.  A warrior of the long house takes no friend
from the wigwam of an Algonquin.  Monakatocka is alone.""

He spoke with a wild pathos, his high, stern features working in the
moonlight, and his bold glance softened into an exquisite melancholy.

""I too am friendless,"" said Landless, ""and bound to a far more degrading
captivity than that you suffer. Our fate is the same.""

The Indian took his hand in his, and raising it, pressed the forefinger
against a certain spot upon his shoulder.  ""You have a friend,"" he said.

""You make too much of a very slight service,"" said Landless.  ""But I
embrace your offer of friendship—there ’s my hand upon it.  And now I
must be going upon my way.  Good-night!""

The Indian gave a guttural ""Good-night,"" and Landless strode on through
the thinning woods. Shortly he emerged from the forest and saw before
him tobacco fields and a house, and beyond the house the vast sheet of
the Chesapeake slumbering beneath the moon.  There was a beaten path
leading to the house.  Landless struck into it and followed it until it
led him beneath a window which (having been once sent with a message to
the Surveyor-General), he knew to belong to the sleeping-chamber of
Major Carrington.  Stopping beneath this window he listened for any
sound that might warn him of aught stirring within or without the
mansion,—all was silent, the house and its inmates locked in slumber.

He took a handful of pebbles from the path and threw them, one by one,
against the wooden shutter, the thud of the last pebble being answered
by a slight noise from within the room.  Presently the shutter was
opened and an authoritative voice demanded:—

""Who is it?  What do you want?""

Landless came closer beneath the window.  ""Major Carrington,"" he said in
a low voice, ""It is I, Godfrey Landless.  I must have speech with you.""

There was a moment’s silence, and then the other said coldly, ""’Must’ is
a word that becomes neither your lips nor my ears.  I know no reason why
Miles Carrington _must_ speak with the servant of Colonel Verney.""

""As you please: Godfrey Landless craves the honor of a word with Major
Carrington.""

""And what if Major Carrington refuses?"" said the other sharply.

""I do not think he will do so.""

The Surveyor-General hesitated a moment, then said:—

""Go to the great door.  I will open to you in a moment.  But make no
noise.""

Landless nodded, and proceeded to follow his directions.  Presently the
door swung noiselessly inward, and Carrington, appearing in the opening,
beckoned Landless within, and led the way, still in profound silence,
across the hall to the great room.  Here, after softly closing the door,
he lighted candles, saw to it that the heavy wooden shutters were
securely drawn across the windows, and turned to face his visitor in a
somewhat different guise than the riding suit and jack boots, the mask
and broad flapping beaver, in which he had appeared in their encounter
in the hut on the marsh.  His stately figure was now wrapped in a
night-gown of dark velvet, his bare feet were thrust into velvet
slippers, and a silken nightcap, half on and half off, imparted a rakish
air to his gravely handsome countenance.  He threw himself into a great
armchair and tapped impatiently upon the table.

""Well!"" he said dryly.

Landless standing before him began to speak with dignity and to the
point.  Godwyn, the head of a great conspiracy, was dead, leaving him,
Landless, in some sort his successor.  In a conference of the leading
conspirators held but a few nights before the murder, Godwyn had
announced that not only had he given to the son of Warham Landless his
complete confidence, but that in case aught should happen to himself
before the time for action, he would wish the young man to succeed him
in the leadership of the revolt. There had been some demur, but Godwyn’s
influence was boundless, and on his advancing reason after reason for
his preference, the Oliverians had acquiesced in his judgment and had
given their solemn promise to respect his wishes.  Three nights later,
Godwyn was murdered.  Since that dreadful blow, Landless had seen only
such of the conspirators as were in his immediate neighborhood.
Confounded at the turn affairs had taken, and utterly at a loss, they
had turned eagerly to him as to one having authority. For his own
freedom, for the sake of his promise to the dead man, he would do his
utmost.  He had come to-night to discover, if possible, Major
Carrington’s intentions—

Carrington, who had listened thus far with grave attention, frowned
heavily.

""If my memory serves me, sirrah, I told you once before that Miles
Carrington stirs not hand or foot in this matter.  I may wish you well,
but that is all.""

""’T is a poor friend that cries ’Godspeed!’ to one who struggles in a
bog, and gives not his hand to help him out.""

""Your figure does not hold,"" said the other, dryly. ""I have not cried
’Godspeed!’  I have said nothing at all, either good or bad.  I have
nothing to do with this conspiracy.  You are the only man now living
that knows that I am aware that such a thing exists. And I hope, sir,
that you will remember how you gained that knowledge.""

""I am in no danger of forgetting.""

""Very well.  Your journey here to-night was a useless as well as a
dangerous one.  I have nothing to say to you.""

""Will you tell me one thing?"" said Landless, patiently.  ""What will
Major Carrington have to say to me upon the day when I speak to him as a
free man with free men behind me?""

""Upon that day,"" said the other, composedly, ""Miles Carrington will
submit to the inevitable with a good grace, having been, as is well
known, a friend to the Commonwealth, and having always, even when there
was danger in so doing, spoken against the cruel and iniquitous
enslavement of men whose only offense was non-conformity, or the having
served under the banners of Cromwell.""

""If he should be offered Cromwell’s position in the new Commonwealth,
what then?""

""Pshaw! no such offer will be made.""

""We must have weight and respectability, must identify ourselves with
that Virginia in which we are strangers, if we are to endure,"" said
Landless, with a smile.  ""A fact that we perfectly recognize—as does
Major Carrington.  He probably knows who is of, and yet head and
shoulders above, that party in the state upon whose support we must
ultimately rely, who alone could lead that party; who alone might
reconcile Royalist and Puritan;—and to whom alone the offer I speak of
will be made.""

Carrington smiled despite himself.  ""Well, then, if the offer is made, I
will accept it.  In short, when your man is out of the bog I will lend
my aid to cleanse him of the stains incurred in the transit.  But he
must pull himself out of the mire.  I am safe upon the bank, I will not
be drawn with him into a bottomless ruin.  Do I make myself plain?""

""Perfectly,"" said Landless, dryly.

The other flushed beneath the tone.  ""You think perhaps that I play but
a craven part in this game. I do not.  God knows I run a tremendous risk
as it is, without madly pledging life and honor to this desperate
enterprise!""

""I fail to see the risk,"" said Landless, coldly.

The other struck his hand against the table.  ""I risk a slave
insurrection!"" he said.

A noise outside the door made them start like guilty things.  The door
opened softly and a charming vision appeared, to wit, Mistress Betty
Carrington, rosy from sleep and hastily clad in a dressing-gown of
sombre silk.  Her little white feet were bare, and her dark hair had
escaped from its prim, white night coif. She started when she saw a
visitor, and her feet drew demurely back under the hem of her gown,
while her hands went up to her disheveled hair: but a second glance
showing her his quality, she recovered her composure and spoke to her
father in her soft, serious voice.

""I heard a noise, my father, and looking into your room, found it empty,
so I came down to see what made you wakeful to-night.""

""’T is but a message from Verney Manor, child,"" said her father.  ""Get
back to bed.""

""From Verney Manor!"" exclaimed Betty.  ""Then I can send back to-night
the song book and book of plays lent me by Sir Charles Carew, and which,
after reading the first page, I e’en restored to their wrappings and
laid aside with a good book a-top to put me in better thoughts if ever I
was tempted to touch them again.  I will get them, good fellow, and you
shall carry them back to their owner with my thanks, if it so be that I
can find words that are both courteous and truthful.""

""Stop, child!"" said her father as she turned to leave the room.  ""The
volumes, which you were very right not to read, may rest awhile beneath
the good book.  This is a secret mission upon which this young man has
come.  It is about a—a matter of state upon which his master and I have
been engaged.  No one here or at Verney Manor must know that he has been
at Rosemead.""

""Very well, my father,"" said Betty, meekly, ""the books can wait some
other opportunity.""

""And,"" with some sternness, ""you will be careful to hold your tongue as
to this man’s presence here to-night.""

""Very well, father.""

""You are not to speak of it to Mistress Patricia or to any one.""

""I will be silent, my father.""

""Very well,"" said the Major.  ""You are not like the majority of women.
I know that your word is as good as an oath.  Now run away to bed,
sweetheart, and forget that you have seen this messenger.""

""I am going now, father,"" said Betty, obediently. ""Is Mistress Patricia
well, good fellow?""

""Quite well, I believe, madam.""

""She spake of crossing to Accomac with Mistress Lettice and Sir Charles
Carew, when the latter should go to visit Colonel Scarborough.  Know you
if she went?""

""I think not, madam.  I think that Sir Charles Carew went alone.""

""Ah!  They have fallen out then,"" said Betty, half to herself, and with
a demure satisfaction in her wild flower face.  ""I am glad of it, for I
like him not. Thanks, good fellow, for your answering my idle
questions.""

Landless bowed gravely.  Betty bent her pretty head, and with a hasty,
""I am going, father!"" in answer to an impatient movement on the part of
the Major, vanished from the room.

Carrington waited until the last light footfall had died away, and then
said, ""Our interview is over. Are you satisfied?""

""At least, I understand your position.""

""Yes,"" said Carrington, thoughtfully, ""it is as well that you should
understand it.  It is simple.  I wish you well.  I am in heart a
Commonwealth’s man.  I love not the Stuarts.  I would fain see this fair
land freed from their rule and returned to the good days of the
Commonwealth.  And I may as well acknowledge, since you have found it
out for yourself,""—a haughty smile,—""that I have my ambitions.  What man
has not?""  He rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind
him, his handsome head bent, his rich robe trailing upon the ground
behind him.

""I could rule this land more acceptably to the people than can William
Berkeley with his parrot phrases, ’divine right,’ and ’passive
obedience.’  I know the people and am popular with them, with Royalist
and Churchman as well as with Nonconformist and Oliverian.  I know the
needs of the colony—home rule, self taxation, free trade, a more liberal
encouragement to emigrants, religious tolerance, a rod of iron, for the
Indians, the establishment of a direct slave trade with Africa and the
Indies.  I could so rule this colony that in a twelvemonth’s time,
Richard Verney or Stephen Ludlow, hot Royalists though they be, would be
forced to acknowledge that never, since the day Smith sailed up the
James, had Virginia enjoyed a tithe of her present prosperity.""

""’’T is a consummation devoutly to be desired,’"" said Landless, dryly.
""In the mean time, like the cat i’ the adage—""

""You are insolent, sirrah!""

""When a stripling I served under one who took the bitter with the sweet,
the danger as well as the reward, who led the soldiers from whom he took
his throne.""

""Cromwell, sirrah,"" said Carrington sternly, ""led soldiers.  You would
require Miles Carrington to lead servants, to place himself, a gentleman
and a master, at the head of a rebellion which, if it failed, would
plunge him into a depth of ignominy and ruin proportionate to the height
from which he fell.  He declines the position.  When you have won your
freedom he will treat with you.  Not before.""

""Then,"" said Landless slowly, ""upon the day on which the flag of the
Commonwealth floats over the Assembly hall at Jamestown, then—""

""Then I will join myself to you as I have said, and I will bring with me
those without whom your revolution would be but short-lived—the Puritan
and Nonconformist element in the colony, gentle and simple.""

""That is sufficiently explicit,"" said Landless, ""and I thank you.""

""I have trusted you fully, young man,"" said the other, stopping before
him, ""not only because you cannot betray me if you would, seeing that
not one scrap of writing exists to inculpate me in this matter, and that
your word would scarce be taken before mine, but because I believe you
to be trustworthy.  I believe also""—graciously—""that Robert Godwyn
(whose death I sincerely mourn) showed his usual wisdom and knowledge of
mankind when he chose you as his confidant and co-worker.  I wish you
well through with a dangerous and delicate piece of work and in
enjoyment of your reward, namely, your freedom, and the esteem of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.  I will myself see to it that any past
offenses which you are supposed to have committed (for myself, I believe
you to have been harshly used), shall not stand in your light.""

""Major Carrington is very good,"" said Landless, calmly.  ""I shall study
to deserve his commendation.""

The other took a restless turn or two through the room, stopping at
length before the younger man.

""You may tell me one thing,"" he said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper, and with his eyes bent watchfully upon the other’s composed
face.  ""Had Godwyn set the day?""

""Yes.""

""And you will adhere to it?""

""Yes.""

""What day?""

""The thirteenth of September.""

""Humph!  Two weeks off!  Well, my tobacco will be largely in, and I
shall send my daughter upon a visit to her Huguenot kindred upon the
Potomac. Good night.""

""Good night,"" answered Landless.




                              *CHAPTER XV*

                       *THE WATERS OF CHESAPEAKE*


Patricia was ennuyée to the last degree.  That morning Sir Charles had
ridden to Green Spring with her father; Mistress Lettice was in the
still room decocting a face wash from rose leaves, dew and honey; young
Shaw on his knees in the master’s room, disconsolately poring over piles
of musty papers in search of a misplaced deed which the colonel had
ordered him to find against his return.  It was a hot and listless
afternoon.  Patricia read a page of ""The Rival Ladies,"" tried her
spinet, had a languid romp with her spaniels, and finally sauntered into
the porch, and leaning her white arms upon the railing, looked towards
the dazzling blue waters of the Chesapeake. Presently an idea came to
her.  She went swiftly into the hall, and called for Darkeih.  When that
handmaiden appeared:—

""Darkeih, go down to the quarters, and tell the first man you meet to
find Woodson, and send him to me.""

Darkeih departed, and in half an hour’s time the overseer appeared at
the foot of the porch steps, red and heated from his rapid walk from the
Three-Mile field.

""What’s wrong, Mistress Patricia?"" he asked quickly.

Patricia opened her lovely eyes.

""Nothing is wrong, Woodson.  What should be?  I sent for you, because I
want to go to Rosemead.""

""To Rosemead!"" exclaimed the overseer.

""Yes, to Rosemead, and I want a couple of men to take me.""

The overseer gave a short, vexed laugh.  ""I can’t spare the men,
Mistress Patricia.  You ought to have known that every man jack on the
plantation is busy cutting.  If I had a known this was all that was
wanted!  Fegs!  I thought something dreadful was the matter.""

""Something dreadful is the matter,"" said the young lady calmly.  ""I am
bored to death.""

""Sorry for ye, missy, but I can’t spare the men.""

""Oh, yes, you can!"" said Patricia with unruffled composure.

The overseer, knowing his lady, began to weaken.

""Anyhow, you would n’t want two men.  You might go on a pillion behind
old Abraham.  I could spare _him_.""

""I shall not go a-horseback.  ’T is too hot and dusty.  I shall go in
one of the sail-boats—the Bluebird, I think.""

""Now, in the name of all that’s contrary, what do you want to do that
for, Mistress Patricia?"" cried the harassed overseer.  ""It’s twice as
far by water.""

""I ’ll reach Rosemead before dark.  The men can bring the boat back
to-night, and Major Carrington will send me home on a pillion
to-morrow.""

""Have you forgotten that to-morrow is Sunday?"" said the overseer
severely, and with a new-born anxiety for the proper observance of the
holy day. ""Will you have the Colonel pay a fine for you?""

""I will go to service with the Carringtons then, and come home on
Monday,"" said the lady serenely.

""There ’s a squall coming up this afternoon.""

""There isn’t a cloud in the sky,"" said his mistress with calm
conviction, looking straight before her at a low, tumbled line of creamy
peaks along the horizon.

""If the Colonel were here—""

""He would say, ’Woodson, do exactly as Mistress Patricia tells you.’""
This with great sweetness.

The overseer gave it up.  ""I reckon he would, missy,"" he said with a
grin.  ""You wind him and all of us around your finger.""

""’T is all for your good, Woodson,"" with a soft, bright laugh.  Then,
coaxingly, ""Am I to have the Bluebird?""

""I reckon so, Mistress Patricia, seeing that you have set your heart
upon it,"" said the still reluctant overseer.

""That’s a good Woodson.  I want Regulus to be one of the boatmen.  You
can send any other you choose.  I shall take Darkeih with me.""

""You can’t have Regulus, Mistress Patricia,"" answered the overseer
positively.  ""He ’s worth any two men in the field.  I can’t let him
go.""

""Let him be at the wharf in half an hour.  I will be ready by then.""

""You can’t have him, Missy.""

Patricia stamped her pretty foot.  ""Am I mistress of this plantation, or
am I not, Woodson?""

""Lord knows you are!"" groaned the overseer.

""Then when I say I want Regulus, I will have Regulus and no other.""

The overseer sighed resignedly.  ""Very well, Mistress Patricia, I ’ll
send for him.""

Patricia danced away, and the overseer strode down the path, viciously
crunching the pebbles and bits of shell beneath his feet.  At the wharf
he found a detachment of the infant population of the quarters busily
crabbing; all of whom, save two little Indians who fished stoically on,
scrambled to their feet, and pulled a forelock.  The overseer touched
one urchin upon the shoulder with the butt end of his whip.

""You, Piccaninny, run as fast as your legs will carry you to the field
by the swamp, and tell Regulus to leave his work, and come to the big
wharf. Mistress Patricia wants to go a pleasuring.""

Piccaninny’s black shanks and pink heels flew up and out, and he was
away like a flash.  The overseer kept on to the end of the wharf, where
were clustered the boats, some tied to the piles, some anchored a little
way out.  ""Haines was to send a man to caulk a seam in the Nancy,"" he
muttered.  ""Whoever he is, he ’ll have to go in the Bluebird.  I ’m not
going to take another man from the tobacco.  What fools women are!  But
they get their way,—the pretty ones at least.""  He leaned over the
railing, and called,—

""You there, in the Nancy!""

Godfrey Landless looked up from his work.  ""What is it?""

The overseer chuckled grimly.  ""It’s that fellow Landless who angered
her once before,"" he said to himself with a malicious grin.  ""Well, ’t
is n’t my business to know which of all the servants on this plantation
she most dislikes to come near her.  She ’ll have to put up with him
to-day.  There is n’t a better boatman on the place anyhow.""

To Landless he said, ""Bring the Bluebird up to the wharf, and see that
she is sweet and clean inside. Mistress Patricia starts for Rosemead in
half an hour, and you and Regulus are to take her.  You ’ll bring the
boat back to-night.  Step lively now!""

Landless brought the Bluebird, a sixteen-foot open boat, up to the
wharf, made the inside, and especially the seat in the stern, spotlessly
clean, put up the sail, and sat down to wait.  Presently Regulus
appeared above him, and swung himself down into the boat with a grin of
delight, for he much preferred sailing with ""’lil missy"" to cutting
tobacco.  He had a great burly form and a broad, ebony face, and he was
the devoted slave of Patricia, and or Patricia’s maid, Darkeih.
Moreover, he enjoyed the distinction of being the first negro born in
the Colony, his parents having been landed from the Dutch privateer
which in 1619 introduced the slave into Virginia.  Viewed through a
vista of nigh three hundred years, he appears a portent, a tremendous
omen, a sign from the Eumenides.  Upon that tranquil summer afternoon in
the Virginia of long ago he was simply a good-humored, docile,
happy-go-lucky, harmless animal.

""’Lil Missy ’s comin’,"" he remarked, with bonhommie, to his fellow
boatman.

Darkeih, laden with cushions, appeared at the edge of the wharf.
Landless, standing in the bow below her, relieved her of her burdens,
and taking her by the hands, swung her down into the boat.  She thanked
him with a smile that showed every tooth in her comely brown
countenance, and tripped aft, where, with the assistance of Regulus, she
proceeded to arrange a cushioned seat for her mistress.

Landless waited for the lady of the manor to come forward.  In the act
of extending her hands to the boatman, she glanced at him, crimsoned,
and drew back.  Landless, interpreting color and action aright, buckled
his armor of studied quiet more closely over a hurt and angry heart.

""I was ordered to attend you, madam,"" he said proudly.  ""But if you so
desire, I will find the overseer and tell him that you wish for some one
else in my place.""

""There is not time,"" was the cold reply.  ""And as well you as any other.
Let us be going.""

Landless held out his arms again.  She measured with her eyes the
distance between her and the boat. ""I do not need any help,"" she said.
""If you will stand aside, I can spring from here to the prow.

""And strike the water instead, madam,"" said Landless, grimly, ""when I
would have to touch more than your hand in order to pull you out.""

She colored angrily, but held out her hands. Landless lifted her down
and steadied her to her seat in the stern.  She thanked him coldly, and
began at once to talk to Regulus with the playful familiarity of a
child.  Regulus grinned delight; he had been ""’lil Missy’s"" slave from
her childhood.  Landless untied the boat from the piles and pushed her
off; Regulus, who was to steer, pulled the tiller towards him, and the
little Bluebird glided from the wharf, made a wide and graceful sweep,
and proceeded leisurely down the inlet towards the waters of the great
bay.

Landless seated himself in the bow, and turned his face away from the
group in the stern.  Patricia leaned back amidst her cushions, and
opened a book; Darkeih, upon the other side of the rudder, held a
whispered flirtation with Regulus, squatting at her feet, the tiller in
his hand.  There was but little wind, but what there was came from the
land, and the Bluebird moved steadily though listlessly down the inlet,
between the velvet marshes.  The water broke against the sides of the
boat with a languid murmur.  It was very hot, and the sky above was of a
steely, unclouded blue that hurt the eyes.  Only in the southwest the
line of cloud hills was erecting itself into an Alpine range.  The glare
of the sun upon the white pages of her book dazzled Patricia’s eyes; the
heat and the lazy swaying motion made her drowsy; With a sigh of
oppression she closed her book, and taking her fan from Darkeih, laid it
across her face, and curled herself among her cushions.

""I will sleep awhile,"" she said to her hand-maiden, and serenely glided
into slumberland.

She was in a balcony with Sir Charles Carew, looking down upon a
fantastic procession that wound endlessly on, with flaunting banners,
and to the sound of kettle-drums and trumpets, when she was aroused by
Landless’ voice.  She opened her eyes and looked up from her nest of
cushions to see him standing above her.

""What is it?"" she asked frigidly.

""I grieve to waken you, madam, but there is a heavy squall coming up.""

She sat up and looked about her.  The Bluebird had left the inlet and
was rising and falling with the long oily swell of the vast sheet of
water that stretched before them to a horizon of vivid blue. North and
east the water met the sky; a mile to the westward was the low wooded
shore which they were skirting.

""The sun is shining,"" said Patricia, bewildered. ""The sky is blue.""

""Look behind you.""

She turned and uttered an exclamation.  The Alpine range had vanished,
and a monstrous pall of gray-black cloud was being slowly drawn upward
and across the smiling heaven.  Even as she looked, it blotted out the
sun.

""We had better make for the shore at once,"" said Landless.  ""We can
reach it before the storm breaks and can find shelter for you until it
is over.""

Patricia exclaimed: ""Why, we cannot be more than three miles from
Rosemead!  Surely we can reach it before that cloud overtakes us!""

""I think not, madam.""

""Regulus!"" cried his mistress imperiously.  ""We can reach Rosemead
before that storm breaks, can we not?""

Among other amiable qualities, Regulus numbered a happy willingness to
please, even at the expense of truth.

""Sho-ly, ’lil Missy,"" he said with emphasis.

""And it will not be much of a squall, besides, will it, Regulus?""

""No, ’lil Missy, not much ob squall,"" answered the obliging Regulus.

""There is much wind in it,"" said Landless.  ""Look at those white clouds
scudding across the black; and these squalls strike with suddenness and
fury.  I may put the boat about, madam?""

""Certainly not.  Regulus, who must know the Chesapeake and its squalls
much better than you possibly can, says there is no danger.  I have no
mind to be set ashore in these woods with night coming on and Indians or
wolves prowling around.""

""I beg that you will be advised by me, madam.""

She looked at him as she had done that day in the master’s room.  ""Is it
that you are _afraid_ of a Virginia squall?  If so, you will have to
conquer your tremor.  Regulus, keep the boat as it is.""

Landless went back to his seat in the bow, with tightened lips.  The
wind freshened, coming in hot little puffs, and the Bluebird slid more
swiftly over the low hills.  The water turned to a livid green and the
air slowly darkened.  Across the black pall, looming higher and higher,
shot a jagged streak of fierce gold, followed by a low rumble of
thunder.  A mass of gray-white, fantastically piled clouds whirled lip
from the eastern horizon to meet the vast blank sullen sheet overhead.
There came a more vivid flash and a louder roll of thunder.

Landless walked aft and took the tiller from Regulus’ hand, motioning
him forward to the place he had himself occupied.  The negro stared, but
went with his accustomed docility.  Patricia sat upright in indignant
surprise.

""What are you doing?""

""I am about to head the boat for the shore,"" suiting the action to the
word.

Her eyes blazed.  ""Did you not hear me say that I wished to proceed to
Rosemead?""

""Yes, madam, I did.""

""I order you, sir—""

""And I choose to disobey.""

""I shall report you to Colonel Verney.""

""As you please, madam.""

From the prow, where he had been taking observations, Regulus cried in a
startled voice: ""De win’s comin’!  De win ’s comin’ mighty quick!""

Landless thrust the tiller into Patricia’s hands. ""Keep it there, just
where it is, for your life!"" he cried authoritatively, and bounded
forward to where Regulus was already struggling with the sail.  They got
it in and lashed to the mast just in time, for, with the shriek of a
thousand demons, the squall whirled itself upon them.  In an instant
they were enveloped in a blinding horror of furious wind and rain, glare
of lightning and incessant, ear-splitting thunder.  A leaden darkness,
illuminated only by the lightning, settled around them, and the air grew
suddenly cold. Beneath the whip of the wind the Chesapeake woke from
slumber, stirred, and rose in fury.  The Bluebird danced dizzily upon
white crests or swooped into black and yawning chasms.  Steadying
himself by the thwarts, Landless went back to Patricia, sitting pale and
with clasped hands, but making no sound.  Darkeih, with a moan of fear,
had thrown herself down at her mistress’ feet, and was hiding her face
in her skirts.  Landless took a scarf from among the pile of cushions,
and wrapped it around Patricia.  ""’T is a poor protection against wet
and cold,"" he said, ""but it is better than nothing.""

""Thank you,"" she said then, with an effort.  ""Do you think this squall
will last long?""

""I cannot tell, madam.  It is rather a hurricane than a squall.  But we
must do the best we can.""

As he spoke there came a fresh access of wind with a glare of
intolerable light.  The mast bent like a reed, snapped off clear to the
foot and fell inward, the loosened beam striking Regulus upon the head,
and bearing him down with it.  The boat careened violently, and half
filled with water.  Darkeih screamed, and Patricia sprang to her feet,
but sat down again at Landless’ stern command, ""Sit still! She will
right in a moment.""

He lifted and flung overboard the mass of splintered wood and flapping
cloth, then fell to bailing with all his might, for the danger of
swamping was imminent. Presently Patricia touched him upon the arm. ""I
will bail if you will see to Regulus,"" she said, in a low, strained
voice.  ""I think he is dead.""

Landless resigned the pail into her hands and lifted the negro’s head
and shoulders from the water in which he was lying, pillowing them upon
the stern seat.  He was unconscious, and bleeding from a cut on the
forehead.

""He is not dead nor like to die,"" Landless said. ""He will revive before
long.""

The girl gave a long, quivering sigh of relief. Landless finished the
bailing and sat down at her feet.

Some time later she asked faintly: ""Do you not think the worst is over
now?""

""I am afraid not,"" he answered gently.  ""There is a lull now, but I am
afraid the storm is but gathering its forces.  But we will hope for the
best—""

Another flash and crash cut him short.  It was followed by rain that
fell, not in drops, but in sheets. The wind, which had been blowing a
heavy gale, rose suddenly into a tornado.  With it rose the sea.  The
masses of water, hissing and smoking under the furious pelting of the
rain, flung themselves upon the hapless Bluebird, laboring heavily in
the trough of the waves, or staggering over their summits.  A constant
glare lit the heaving, tossing world of waters, and the air became one
roar of wind, rain, and thunder.

Darkeih crouched moaning at her mistress’ feet Regulus lay unconscious,
breathing heavily. Suddenly, with a quick intake of his breath, Landless
seized Patricia, pulled her down into the bottom of the boat, and held
her there.

""I see,"" she said in a low, awed voice.  ""It is Death!""

Through the glare a long green wall bore down upon them.  The Bluebird
leaped to meet it.  It lifted her up, up to meet the lightning, then
hurled her into black depths, and passed on, leaving her staggering in
the trough, water-logged and helpless.

Patricia lifted her white face from her hands. ""We rode that dreadful
wave?"" she cried incredulously.

""By God’s mercy, yes,"" said Landless gravely.

""Is there any hope for us?""

Landless hesitated.  ""Tell me the truth,"" she said imperiously.

""We are in desperate case, madam.  The boat is half filled with water.
Another such sea will sink us.""

""Why do you not bail the boat?""

""The bucket is gone; the tiller also.""

She shivered, and Darkeih began to wail aloud. Landless laid a heavy
hand upon the latter’s shoulder. ""Silence!"" he said sternly.  ""Here!  I
shall lay Regulus’ head in your lap, and you are to watch over him and
not to think of yourself.  There ’s a brave wench!""

Darkeih’s lamentations subsided into a low sobbing, and Landless turned
to her mistress.

""Try to keep up your courage, madam,"" he said. ""Our peril is great; but
while there is life there is hope.""

""I am not afraid,"" she said.  ""I—""  The pitching of the boat threw her
against Landless, and he put his arm about her.  ""You must let me hold
you, madam,"" he said quietly.  She shrank away from his touch, saying
breathlessly, ""No, oh no!  See!  I can hold quite well by the gunwale.""
He acquiesced in silence, only lifting her into a more secure position.
""I thank you,"" she said humbly.

The storm continued to rage with unabated fury. Flash and detonation
succeeded flash and detonation; the rain poured in torrents: and the
wind whooped on the angry sea like a demon of destruction.  The Bluebird
pitched and tossed at the mercy of the great waves that combed above
her.  Time passed, and to the darkness of the storm was added the
darkness of the night.  The occupants of the boat, drenched by the rain
and the seas she had shipped, shivered with cold.  Regulus began to stir
and mutter.  ""He is coming to himself,"" Landless cried to Darkeih. ""When
you see that he is conscious, make him lie still.  He must not move
about.""

""Do you know where we are?"" asked Patricia.

""No, madam; but I fear that the wind is driving us out into the bay.""

""Ah!""

She said it with a sob, for a sudden vision of home flashed across the
cold and darkness; and presently Landless could hear that she was
weeping.

The sound went to his heart.  ""I would God could help you, madam,"" he
said gently.  ""Take comfort!  You are in the hands of One who holds the
sea in the hollow of His hand.""

In a little while she was quiet.  There passed another long interval of
silent endurance, broken by Patricia’s saying piteously, ""My hands are
so numbed with cold that I cannot hold to the side of the boat And my
arms are bruised with striking against it.""

Without a word Landless put his arm around her, and held her steady
amidst the tossings of the boat. ""You are shivering with cold!"" he said.
""If I had but something to wrap you in!""

She drooped against him, and the lightning showed him her face, still
and white, with parted lips, and long lashes sweeping her marble cheek.

""Madam, madam!"" he cried roughly.  ""You must not swoon!  You must not!""

With a strong effort she rallied.  ""I will try to be brave,"" she said
plaintively.  ""I am not frightened,—not very much.  But oh!  I am cold
and tired!""

He drew her head down upon his knee.  ""Let it lie there,"" he said,
speaking as to a tired child.  ""I will hold you quite steady.  Now shut
your eyes and try to sleep.  The storm is no worse than it was; and
since the boat has lived this long in this sea, she may live through the
night.  And with morning may come many chances of safety.  Try to rest
in that hope.""

Faint and exhausted from cold and terror, she submitted like a child,
and lay with closed eyes in a sort of stupor within his arms.

There was less lightning now, and the thunder sounded in long booming
peals, instead of short, sharp cannon cracks.  The rain, too, had
ceased; but the wind blew furiously, and the sea ran in tremendous
waves.  Regulus stirred, groaned, and struggled into a sitting posture.
""Lie down again!"" ordered Darkeih. ""We ’s all on de way to Heaben, but
if nigger shake de boat, we ’ll get dere befo’ de Lawd ready for us.
Lie down!""  Regulus, muttering to himself, looked stupidly about him,
then dropped his head back into her lap.  In three minutes he was
snoring. Darkeih’s whimpering died away, and her turbaned head sank
lower and lower, until it rested upon that of Regulus, and she, too,
slept.

Landless sat very still, holding his burden lightly and tenderly, and
staring into the darkness.  Against the steep slope of the sea, a
picture framed itself, melted away, and was followed by others in long
procession.  He saw a ruinous, ivy-grown hall, and an old, grave, formal
garden, where, between long box hedges broken by fantastic yews, there
walked a boy, book in hand.  A man with a stately figure and a stern,
careworn face met the boy, and they leaned upon a broken dial, and the
father reasoned with the son of Right and Truth and Liberty, and
something touched upon the Tyrannicides of old.  The yew trees drooped
their sombre boughs about the figures, and they were gone, and in their
place roared and swelled the Chesapeake....  The sound of the storm
became the sound of a battle-cry.  He saw a clanging fight where sword
clashed upon armor, and artillery belched fire and thunder, and horse
and man went down in the melée, and were trampled under foot amidst
shrieks and oaths and stern prayers.  The boy who had leaned upon the
dial fought coolly, desperately, drunk with the joy of battle, stung to
fierce effort by his father’s eyes.  The great banner, blazoned with the
Cross of Saint George, streamed in crimson and azure between the battle
and the lonely watcher in the storm-tossed boat, and the vision was
gone.... The spires of a great city, where men walked with long faces
and church bells made the only music, rose through the gloom, and he saw
a dingy chamber in a dingy stack of buildings, and within it, bending
over great tomes of law, a man, impoverished and orphaned, but young,
strong, and full of hope,—a man well spoken of and allowed to be on the
road to high preferment.  The chamber wavered into darkness; but the
city spires flashed light, and the slow ringing changed to mad peals
from joy bells.  Some one had been restored—to drop balm upon the
bleeding heart of a nation, to bring light to them that sit in
darkness,—so said the joy bells....  He saw a loathsome prison, and the
man who had sat in the dingy chamber lying therein under accusation of a
crime which he had not committed.  He saw him pining there, week after
week, month after month, untried, forgotten, at the mercy of an enemy to
his house whose day had come with the Restored One....  The prison
vanished, and the waves that tossed around him were the waves of the
Atlantic.  A ship ploughed her way through them.  He saw into her
hold,—a horrible place of stench and filth and darkness,—a place where
hounds would not have kenneled.  Men and women were there who cursed and
fought for the scanty, worm-eaten food that was thrown them.  Some wore
gyves: they were heavy upon the wrists and ankles of the man of his
vision.  He saw a face looking down upon this man, a handsome
supercilious face, with insolent amusement in the languid eyes and in
the curves of the lips.  The hatches were battened down upon the cargo
of misery, and the ship with its brutal captain and its handful of
gold-laced, dicing, swearing passengers vanished....  He saw a sandy,
grass-grown street, and a row of mean houses, and a low, brick building
with barred windows.  There was a crowd before this building, and a man
standing upon the platform of a pillory was selling human flesh and
blood.  He saw the boy who had stood beneath the yews of the old Hull,
who had fought at Worcester beneath his father’s eye; the man who had
lain in prison and in the noisome hold of the ship, put up and sold to
the highest bidder.  He saw him carried away with other merchandise to
the home of his purchaser.  He saw a Virginia plantation lying fair and
serene beneath a Virginia heaven; and a wide porch, and standing therein
an angelic vision, all grace and beauty, vivid youth and splendor.

The picture vanished into the night that raved about him, and with a
long shaken sigh he let his eyes fall from the watery steeps to the face
of the woman who lay within his arms.  He had not looked at her before,
conceiving that she might be awake and feel his glance upon her.  Now he
could tell from her breathing that she slept.  He gazed upon the pure
pale face with the golden hair falling about it, in a passion of pity
and tenderness.  She moaned now and then in her sleep, or turned
uneasily in his arms. Once she spoke a few words, and he bent eagerly to
catch them, thinking that she had awakened and was speaking to him.
They were:—

""Ah, your Excellency! where I reign there shall be only good Churchmen
and loyal Cavaliers—no Roundheads, no rebel or convict servants!"" and
she laughed in her sleep.

Landless shrank as from a mortal blow, then broke into a bitter laugh,
and said to himself, ""Thou art a fool, Godfrey Landless.  It were but
too easy to forget to-night what thou art and what thou must seem to
her.  Thou art answered according to thy folly.""  He sighed impatiently,
and withdrawing his gaze from the sleeping face, fell into a sombre
reverie.

He was roused to active consciousness by a sudden and death-like pause
in the gale.  The lightning showed the pall of cloud hanging low, black,
and unbroken; but the wind had sunk into an ominous calm. He looked
anxiously around him, then softly disengaging himself from Patricia,
leaned across her, and shook Regulus awake.  The negro started up,
stupid from sleep and from his wound.

""What is it, massa?"" he queried.  ""Wake mighty early at Rosemead....
Lawd hab mercy! we ’s still on de Chesapeake!""

""We will be in the Chesapeake in a moment,"" said Landless sternly, ""if
you stagger about in that way. Sit down and pull your wits together.
You are like to need them all directly.""  He touched Darkeih and said,
as her eyes, wide with alarm, opened upon him, ""Listen, my wench!
Whatever happens, you are to trust yourself to Regulus.  He is a strong
swimmer and he will take care of you.  You hear, Regulus!""

""What is it?"" exclaimed Patricia, as he bent over her.  ""Why have you
waked Regulus?  And oh! has not that dreadful wind died away?""

""It has stopped, madam, stopped suddenly and utterly,"" he said gravely.
""But it will come upon us from another quarter, and it will bring the
sea with it.""  He raised her, and held her with his arm. ""Trust yourself
to me when it comes,"" he said gently. ""If I can save you, I will.""

There was no time for more.  Above them broke a new and more terrible
storm.  A ball of fire shot from the cloud into the sea; it was followed
by a crash that seemed to shake the earth.  A cataract of rain
descended.  From the northeast there swooped upon them a wind to which
the gale of an hour before seemed a zephyr.  It drove the boat before it
as if she had been the bird from which she took her name.  It piled wave
on wave until the sea ran in mountains. Athwart the storm came a dull
booming roar, and above the great hills of water appeared a long ridge
crested with white.

""It is coming,"" said Landless.

Patricia looked up at him with great, despairing, courageous eyes.  ""I
have caused your death,"" she said.  ""Forgive me.""

There came a vivid flash, and a loud scream from Darkeih.  ""De lan’! de
bressed, bressed, lan’!""

Landless wheeled.  Silhouetted against the lit sky he saw a fringe of
pines, and below it a low, shelving shore where the waves were breaking
in foam and thunder.  The Bluebird, driven by the wind, was hurrying
towards it in mad bounds.  The great wave overtook her, bore her onward
with it, and sunk her within fifty feet of the shore.

Ten minutes later Landless, breathless and exhausted, staggered from out
the hell of pounding waves and blinding, stinging spray on to the shore.
Unlocking Patricia’s arms from about his neck he laid her gently down
upon the sand and turned to look for the other occupants of the hapless
Bluebird. They were close behind him.  In a few minutes the two men,
battling against wind and rain, had borne the women out of reach of the
waves, and had placed them in the shelter of a low bank of sand.  As
Landless set his burden down he said reverently, ""I thank God, madam.""

""And I thank God,"" she answered, in the same tone.

He tried to shield her from the wind with his body. ""It is frightful,""
he said, ""that you should be exposed to such a night.  I pray God that
you take no harm.""

""Would it not be more sheltered higher up the shore, under those trees?""

""Perhaps, but I fear to risk you there with the lightning so near.
Later, when the storm subsides, we will try it.""

He seated himself so as to screen her as much as possible from wind and
rain, and a silence fell upon the party so suddenly snatched from death.
Regulus stretched himself upon the sand and pulled Darkeih down beside
him.  Within a few minutes they were both asleep.  The white man and
woman sat side by side without speaking, watching the storm.

By degrees it raved itself out.  The rain fell in less and less volume,
the lightning became infrequent, the thunder pealed less loudly, and the
wind died from a hurricane into a breeze.  In two hours’ time from the
swamping of the boat the booming of the sea, and a ragged mass of cloud,
lit by an occasional flash and slowly falling away from a pale and
watery moon, were the only evidences of the tornado which had raged so
lately.

""The storm is over,"" said Patricia, breaking a long silence.

""Yes,"" said Landless.  ""You have nothing to fear now.  Would you not
like to walk a little?  You must be sadly chilled and weary with long
sitting.""

""Yes, I would,"" she answered, with a sigh of relief. ""Let us walk
towards those trees, and see if forest or water be beyond them.""

He helped her to her feet, and they left the slaves sleeping upon the
ground, and moved slowly, for she was numbed with cold, towards the
fringe of pines.

Landless walked beside her without speaking.  A while ago she had been
simply a woman in danger of death—something for him to protect and to
save. He had well nigh forgotten: he knew that she had quite forgotten.
She was safe now, and was become once more the lady of the manor to
whose soil he was fettered, he had remembered, and she was beginning to
remember, for presently she said timidly and sweetly, but with
condescension in her voice;—

""I am not ungrateful for all that you have done for me to-night, for
saving my life.  And, trust me, you will not find your mas—my father,
ungrateful either.  We will find some way to reward—""

""I neither merit nor desire reward, madam,"" said Landless, proudly and
sadly, ""for doing but my duty as a man and as your servant.""

""But—"" she began kindly, when he interrupted her with sudden passion.

""Unless you wish to cut me to the heart, to bitterly humiliate me, you
will not speak of payment for any service I may have done you.  I have
been a gentleman, madam.  For this one night treat me as such.""

""I beg your pardon,"" she said at once.

They reached the belt of trees and entered it. Outside, the broken
clouds had permitted an occasional gleam of watery moonshine; within the
shadow of the trees it was gross darkness.  Above them the wet branches,
moved by the wind which still blew strongly, clashed together with a
harsh and mournful sound, showering them with heavy raindrops.  Their
feet sank deeply in cushions of soaked moss and rotting leaves.

""There is nothing to be done here,"" said Landless. ""It is better beneath
the open sky.""

There came a last, vivid flash of lightning that for a moment lit the
wood, showing long colonnades of glistening tree trunks, with here and
there a blasted and fallen monster.  It showed something more, for
within ten feet of them, from out a tangle of dripping, rain-beaten
vines looked the face of the murderer of Robert Godwyn.




                             *CHAPTER XVII*

                        *LANDLESS AND PATRICIA*


For one moment the parties to this midnight encounter stared at each
other with starting eyeballs; the next, down came the curtain of
darkness between them.

With a cry of terror Patricia seized and clung to Landless’s arm,
trembling violently, and with her breath coming in long, gasping sobs.
Exhausted by the previous terrors of the night, this last experience
completely unnerved her—she seemed upon the point of swooning.  Divining
what would soonest calm her, Landless hurried her out of the wood and
down the shore to the bank, beneath which lay the sleeping slaves.  Here
she sank upon the sand, her frame quivering like an aspen.  ""That
dreadful face!"" she said in a low, shaken voice.  ""It is burned upon my
eyeballs.  How came it there?  Was it—dead?""

""No, no, madam,"" Landless said soothingly. ""’Tis simple enough.  The
murderer is in hiding within these woods, and we stumbled upon his
lair.""

She gazed fearfully around her.  ""I see it everywhere.  And may he not
follow us down here?  Oh, horrible!""

""He is not likely to do that,"" said Landless, with a smile.  ""You may
rest assured that he is far from this by now.""

She drew a long breath of relief.  ""Oh!  I hope he is!"" she cried
fervently.  ""It was dreadful!  No storm could frighten me as did that
face!"" and she shuddered again.

""Try not to think of it,"" he said.  ""It is gone now; try to forget it.""

""I will try,"" she said doubtfully.

Landless did not answer, and the two sat in silence, watching out the
dreary night.  But not for long, for presently Patricia said humbly:—

""Will you talk to me?  I am frightened.  It is so still, and I cannot
see you, nor the slaves, only that horrid, horrid face.  I see it
everywhere.""

Landless came nearer to her, and laid one hand upon the skirt of her wet
robe.  ""I am here, close to you, madam,"" he said; ""there can nothing
harm you.""

He began to speak quietly and naturally of this and that, of what they
should do when the day broke, of Regulus’s wound, of the storm, of the
great sea and its perils.  He told her something of these latter, for he
knew the sea; piteous tales of forlorn wrecks, brave tales of dangers
faced and overcome, of heroic endurance and heroic rescue.  He told her
tales of a wild, rockbound Devonshire coast with its scattered fisher
villages; of a hidden cave, the resort of a band of desperadoes, half
smugglers, half pirates, wholly villains; of how this cave had been long
and vainly searched for by the authorities; of how, one night, a boy
climbed down a great precipice, scaring the sea-fowl from their nests,
and lighted upon this cavern with the smugglers in it, and in their
midst a defenseless prisoner whom they were about to murder.  How he had
shouted and made wailing, outlandish noises, and had sent rocks hurtling
down the cliffs, until the wretches thought that all the goblins of land
and sea were upon them, and rushed from the cavern, leaving their work
undone.  Whereupon, the boy reclimbed the cliff, and hastening to the
nearest village, roused the inhabitants, who hurried to their boats, and
descending upon the long-sought-for cave, surprised the smugglers, cut
them down to a man, and rescued the prisoner.

The man who told these things told them well. The wild tales ran like a
strain of sombre music through the night.  His audience of one forgot
her terror and weariness, and listened with eager interest.

""Well—"" she said, as he paused.

""That is all.  The ruffians were all killed and the prisoner rescued.""

""And the boy?""

""Oh, the boy!  He went back to his books.""

""Did you know him?""

""Yes, I knew him.  See, madam, it has quite cleared.  How the moon
whitens those leaping waves!""

""Yes, it is beautiful.  I am glad the prisoner escaped.  Was he a
fisherman?""

""No; an officer of the Excise—a gallant man, with a wife and many
children.  Yes, I suppose he prized life.""

""And I am glad that the smugglers were all killed.""

Landless smiled.  ""Life to them was sweet, too, perhaps.""

""I do not care.  They were wicked men who deserved to die.  They had
murdered and robbed. They were criminals—""

She stopped short, and her face turned from white to red and then to
white again, and her eyes sought the ground.

""I had forgotten,"" she muttered.

The hot color rose to Landless’s cheek, but he said quietly:—

""You had forgotten what, madam?""

She flashed a look upon him.  ""You know,"" she said icily.

""Yes, I know,"" he answered.  ""I know that the perils of this night had
driven from your mind several things.  For a little while you have
thought of, and treated me, as an equal, have you not?  You could not
have been more gracious to,—let us say, to Sir Charles Carew.  But now
you have remembered what I am, a man degraded and enslaved, a felon,—in
short, the criminal who, as you very justly say, should not be let to
live.""

She made no answer, and he rose to his feet.

""It is almost day, and the moon is shining brightly. You no longer fear
the face in the dark?  I will first waken the slaves, and then will push
along the shore, and strive to discover where we are.""

She looked at him with tears in her eyes.  ""Wait,"" she said, putting out
a trembling hand.  ""I have hurt you.  I am sorry.  Who am I to judge
you?  And whatever you may have done, however wicked you may have been,
to-night you have borne yourself towards a defenseless maiden as truly
and as courteously as could have done the best gentleman in the land.
And she begs you to forget her thoughtless words.""

Landless fell upon his knee before her.  ""Madam!"" he cried, ""I have
thought you the fairest piece of work in God’s creation, but harder than
marble towards suffering such as may you never understand! But now you
are a pitying angel!  If I swear to you by the honor of a gentleman, by
the God above us, that I am no criminal, that I did not do the thing for
which I suffer, will you believe me?""

""You mean that you are an innocent man?"" she said breathlessly.

""As God lives, yes, madam.""

""Then why are you here?""

""I am here, madam,"" he said bitterly, ""because Justice is not blind.
She is only painted so.  Led by the gleam of gold she can see well
enough—in one direction.  I could not prove my innocence.  I shall never
be able to do so.  And any one—Sir William Berkeley, your father, your
kinsman—would tell you that you are now listening to one who differs
from the rest of the Newgate contingent, from the coiners and cheats,
the cut-throats and highway robbers in whose company he is numbered,
only in being hypocrite as well as knave.  And yet I ask you to believe
me.  I am innocent of that wrong.""

The moonlight struck full upon his face as he knelt before her.  She
looked at him long and intently, with large, calm eyes, then said softly
and sweetly:—

""I believe you, and pity you, sir.  You have suffered much.""

He bowed his head, and pressed the hem of her skirt to his lips.

""I thank you,"" he said brokenly.

""Is there nothing?"" she said after a pause, ""nothing that I can do?""

He shook his head.  ""Nothing, madam.  You have given me your belief and
your divine compassion.  It is all that I ask, more than I dared dream
of asking an hour ago.  You cannot help me.  I must dree my weird.  I
would even ask of your goodness that you say nothing of what I have told
you to Colonel Verney or to any one.""

""Yes,"" she said thoughtfully.  ""If I cannot help you, it were wiser not
to speak.  I might but make your hard lot harder.""

""Again I thank you.""  He kissed the hem of her robe once more, and rose
to his feet with a heart that sat lightly on its throne.

The day began to break.  With the first faint flush Landless woke the
slaves, who at length yawned and shivered themselves into consciousness
of their surroundings.  ""What are we to do now?"" demanded Patricia.

""We had best strike through that belt of woods until we come to some
house, whence we may get conveyance for you to Verney Manor.""

""Very well.  But oh! do not let us enter the forest here where we saw
that fearful face.  Let us walk along the shore until the light grows
stronger.  It is still night within the woods.""

Landless acquiesced with a smile, and the four—he and Patricia in front,
the negroes straying in the rear—set out along the shore.  The air was
chill and heavy, but there was no wind, and the unclouded sky gave
promise of a hot day.  In the east the rosy flush spread and deepened,
and a pink path stretched itself across the fast subsiding waters.  The
wet sand dragged at their feet, and made walking difficult, moreover
Patricia was chilled and weary, so their progress was slow.  There were
dark circles beneath her eyes, and her lips had a weary, downward curve;
her golden hair, broken from its fastenings, hung in damp, rich masses
against her white throat and blue-veined temples, and amidst the
enshrouding glory her perfect face looked very small and white and
childlike.  The magnificent eyes carried in their clear, brown depths an
expression new to Landless.  Heretofore he had seen in them scorn and
dislike; now they looked at him with a grave and wondering pity.

As the sun rose, the shipwrecked party left the shore, and entered the
forest.  A purple light filled its vast aisles.  Far overhead bits of
azure gleamed through the rifts in the foliage, but around them was the
constant patter and splash of rain drops, falling slow and heavy from
every leaf and twig.  There was a dank, rich smell of wet mould and
rotting leaves, and rain-bruised fern.  The denizens of the woodland
were all astir.  Birds sang, squirrels chattered, the insect world
whirred around the yellow autumn blooms and the purpling clusters of the
wild grape; from out the distance came the barking of a fox.  The
sunlight began to fall in shafts of pale gold through openings in the
green and leafy world, and to warm the chilled bodies of the wayfarers.

""It is like a bad dream,"" said Patricia gayly, as Landless held back a
great, wet branch of cedar from her path.  ""All the storm and darkness,
and the great hungry waves and the danger of death!  Ah! how happy we
are to have waked!""

Her glance fell upon Landless’s face, and there came to her a sudden
realization that there were those in the world, to whom life was not one
sweet, bright gala day.  She gazed at him with troubled eyes.

""I hope you care to live,"" she said.  ""Death is very dreadful.""

""I do not think so,"" he answered.  ""At least it would be forgetfulness.""

She shuddered.  ""Ah! but to leave the world, the warm, bright, beautiful
world!  To die on your bed, when you are old—that is different.  But to
go young! to go in storm and terror, or in horror and struggling as did
that man who was murdered!  Oh, horrible!""

The thought of the murdered man brought another thought into her mind.

""Do you think,"" she said, ""that we had better tell that we saw the
murderer at the first house to which we come, or had we best wait until
we reach Verney Manor?""

Landless gave a great start.  ""You will tell Colonel Verney that?""

She opened her eyes widely.  ""Why, of course! What else should we do?
Is not the country being scoured for him?  My father is most anxious
that he should be captured.  Justice and the weal of the State demand
that such a wretch should be punished.""  She paused and looked at him
gravely as he walked beside her with a clouded face.  ""You say nothing!
This man is guilty, guilty of a dreadful crime.  Surely you do not wish
to shield him, to let him escape?""

""Not so, madam,"" said Landless in desperation. ""But—but—""

""But what?"" she asked as he stopped in confusion.

He recovered himself.  ""Nothing, madam.  You are right, of course.  But
I would not speak before reaching Verney Manor.""

""Very well.""

Landless walked on, bitterly perplexed and chagrined. The strife and
danger of the night, the intoxicating sweetness of the morning hours
when he knew himself believed in and pitied by the woman beside him, had
driven certain things into oblivion.  He had been dreaming, and now he
had been plucked from a fool’s paradise, and dashed rudely to the
ground. Yesterday and the life and thoughts of yesterday, which had but
now seemed so far away, pressed upon him remorselessly.  And to-morrow!
He did not want Roach to be taken.  Always there would have been danger
to himself and his associates in the capture of the murderer, but now
when the vindictive wretch would assuredly attribute his disaster to the
man to whom the lightning flash had revealed his presence on the shores
of the bay, the danger was trebled.  And it was imminent.  He had little
doubt that another night would see Roach in custody, and he had no doubt
at all that the scoundrel would make a desperate effort to save his neck
by betraying what he knew of the conspiracy—and thanks to Godwyn’s lists
he knew a great deal—to Governor and Council.

Patricia began to speak again.  ""It imports much that men should see
that there is no weakness in the arm the law stretches out to seize and
punish offenders.  My father and the Governor and Colonel Ludlow believe
that there is afoot an Oliverian plot—  What is the matter?""

""Nothing, madam.""

""You stood still and caught your breath.  Are you ill, faint?""

""It is nothing, madam, believe me?  You were saying?""

""Oh! the Oliverians!  Nothing definite has been discovered as yet, but
there is thunder in the air, my father says, and I know that he and the
Governor and the rest of the council are very watchful just now. But
yesterday my father said that those few hundred men form a greater
menace to the Colony than do all the Indians between this and the South
Sea.""

They walked on in silence for a few moments, and then she broke out.
""They are horrible, those grim, frowning men!  They are rebels and
traitors, one and all, and yet they stand by and shake curses on the
heads of true men.  They slew the best man, the most gracious sovereign;
they trampled the Church under foot, they made the blood of the noble
and the good to flow like water, and now when they receive a portion of
their deserts, they call themselves martyrs! They, martyrs!  Roundhead
traitors!""

""Madam,"" interrupted Landless with a curious smile upon his lips, ""did
you not know that I was, that I am, what you call a Roundhead?""

""No,"" she said, ""I did not know,"" and stood perfectly still, looking
straight before her down the long vista of trees.  He saw her face
change and harden into the old expression of aversion.  The slaves came
up to them, and Regulus asked if ’lil Missy wanted anything.  ""No,
nothing at all,"" she answered, and walked quietly onward.

Landless, an angry pain tugging at his heart, kept beside her, for they
were passing through a deep hollow in the wood where the gnarled and
protruding roots of cypress and juniper made walking difficult, and
where a strong hand was needed to push aside the wet and pendent masses
of vine.  Regulus, fifty yards behind them, began to sing a familiar
broadside ballad, torturing the words out of all resemblance to English.
The rich notes rang sweetly through the forest.  Down from the far
summit of a pine flashed a cardinal bird, piercing the gloom of the
hollow like a fire ball thrown into a cavern.  Landless held aside a
curtain of glistening leaves that, mingled with purple clusters of
fruit, hung across their path.  Patricia passed him, then turned
impulsively.  ""You think me hard!"" she said.  ""Many people think me so,
but I am not so, indeed....  And there are good Puritans. Major
Carrington, they say, is Puritan at heart, and he is a good man and a
gentleman....  And you saved my life....  At least you are not like
those men of whom I spoke.  You would not plot against the good peace
which we enjoy!  You would not try to array servant against master?""

It was a direct question asked with large, straight-forward eyes fixed
upon his.  He tried to evade it, but she asked again with insistence,
and with a faint doubt lurking in her eyes, ""If these men are plotting,
which God forbid! you know nothing of it?  You have great wrongs, but
you would take no such dastard way to right them?""

Landless’s soul writhed within him, but he told the inevitable lie that
was none the less a lie that it was also the truth.  He said in a low
voice, ""I trust, madam, that I will do naught that may misbecome a
gentleman.""

She was quite satisfied.  He saw that he had regained the ground lost by
his avowal of a few minutes before, and he cursed himself and cursed his
fate.

Soon afterwards they emerged from the forest upon a tobacco patch, from
the midst of which rose a rude cabin, in whose doorway stood a woman
serving out bowls of loblolly to half a dozen tow-headed children.

Half an hour later, Patricia, rested and refreshed, took her seat behind
the oxen, which the owner of the cabin had harnessed up, with much
protestation of his eagerness to serve the daughter of Colonel Verney,
emptied her purse in the midst of the open-mouthed children, and bade
kindly adieu to the good wife. Darkeih curled herself up in the bottom
of the cart, and Landless and Regulus walked beside it.

In two hours’ time they were at Verney Manor, where they found none but
women to greet them. Rendered uneasy by the storm, Woodson had
despatched a messenger to Rosemead, who had returned with the tidings
that no boat from Verney Manor had reached that plantation.  The
overseer had ill news with which to greet the Colonel and Sir Charles
when at midnight they arrived unexpectedly from Green Spring.  Since
then every able-bodied man had deserted the plantation.  There were no
boats at the wharf, no horses in the stables.  The master and Sir
Charles were gone in the Nancy, the two overseers on horseback.  A
Sabbath stillness brooded over the plantation, until a negro woman
recognized the occupants of the ox-cart lumbering up the road.  Then
there was noise enough of an exclamatory, feminine kind.  The shrill
sounds penetrated to the great room, where, behind drawn curtains,
surrounded by essences, and an odor of burnt feathers, with Chloe to fan
her, and Mr. Frederick Jones to murmur consolation, reclined Mistress
Lettice.  As Patricia stepped upon the porch, Betty Carrington flew down
the stairs and through the hall, and the two met with a little
inarticulate burst of cries and kisses.  Mistress Lettice in the great
room went into hysterics for the fifth time that morning.




                            *CHAPTER XVIII*

                              *A CAPTURE*


At noon the next day returned the search party, dispatched by the
Colonel on receipt of his daughter’s information, and headed by Woodson
and Sir Charles Carew.  In their midst, bound with ropes, and seated
behind one of the mounted men, was Roach.  His clothing hung from him in
tatters, and witnessed, moreover, to the quagmires and mantled pools
through which he had struggled; his arm had been injured, and was tied
with a bloody rag; blood was caked upon his villainous face, scratched
and torn in his breathless bursting through thickets; his red hair fell
over his eyes in matted elf-locks; his lips were drawn back in a snarl
over discolored fangs; he panted like a dog, his thick red tongue
hanging out.  He looked hardly human.  The man behind whom he rode was
Luiz Sebastian.

The party dismounted in the small square, in the midst of the quarters.
It being the noon rest, the entire servant population was on hand, and
leaving its cabins and smoking messes of bacon and succotash, it
hastened to a man to the square, where, beneath the dead tree and its
sinister appendage, stood the master, listening to Woodson’s account of
the capture, and to Sir Charles’s airy interpolations.  Roach, dragged
from the horse by a dozen officious hands, staggered with exhaustion.
Luiz Sebastian caught him by the arm and so held him during the ensuing
interview.

When the unusual bustle, the neighing of the horses, and the excited
voices of the crowd brought the news of the capture to Landless,
sitting, sunk in anxious thought, within his cabin, he rose and began to
pace to and fro in the narrow room.  Past his door hurried men, women
and children on their way to the square.  One or two beckoned him to
follow, but he shook his head.  ""If he betray me,"" he thought, ""my fate
will come to me soon enough.  I will not go to meet it.""

In his restless pacing to and fro, he stopped before a shelf where,
beside some coarse eating utensils and the heap of tobacco pegs, the
cutting of which occupied his spare moments, lay a little worn book.  It
had been Godwyn’s.  He opened it at random, and read a few verses.  With
a heavy sigh he laid his arm along the shelf and rested his burning
forehead upon it.  ""’Let not your heart be troubled,’"" he said beneath
his breath; and again, ""’Let not your heart be troubled.’""  He
recommenced his pacing up and down the room.  ""’Peace I leave with you,
My peace I give unto you.’""  Going to the doorway he leaned against it
and looked out into a world of sunshine, and up to where the topmost
branches of a pine slept against the blue.  ""There may be peace beyond,""
he said.  ""I have not found it here.""

Down the lane came a murmur of voices; then the overseer’s harsh tones;
then a light and mocking laugh.  Seized by an uncontrollable impulse he
left the cabin and directed his steps towards the square. As he passed a
cabin some doors from his own, a gaunt figure arose from the doorstep
and joined itself to him.

""The murderer is here,"" said the sepulchral voice of Master Win-Grace
Porringer.  ""Verily the blood hath been taken out of his mouth, and his
abominations from between his teeth.  Cursed be the shedder of innocent
blood!""

""Amen,"" said Landless, then.  ""This capture is like to be our ruin.
This wretch will not keep silence.""

""But he has no proofs.  Since you destroyed those lists there exists not
a scrap of writing about this affair.  And we have covered our tracks as
carefully as if we were the cursed heathen of the land upon the
war-path.  Let him say what he will.  The Malignants, besotted fools!
will think he lies to save his neck.""

""A week ago they might have thought so,"" said Landless.  ""But not now.
Something has gotten abroad.  Already Governor and Council think they
smell a plot.""

The Muggletonian caught his breath.  ""How do you know this?""

""No matter how: I know it.""

Porringer raised his scarred face to heaven.  ""God,"" he said, ""we are
thy people!  Save us!  Let destruction come upon them unawares; let them
go down a dark and slippery way to death; make them to be as blind and
deaf adders that see not the foot of the destroyer!  Yea, shake thy hand
upon these Malignants and make them a spoil to their servants!""  He
turned his ghastly face and burning eyes upon Landless. ""Curse them with
me!"" he cried.

Landless shook his head.  ""Thou and I look not alike at things, friend,""
he said.

""Thou art a Laodicean!"" cried the other wildly. ""Thou hast not an eye
single to the Lord’s work as had thy father before thee.  Thou wouldst
not smite the Amalekites hip and thigh, root and branch!  One damsel
would thou save alive, and for her sake thy heart is soft towards the
whole accursed brood!  Look to it lest the Lord spew thee out of His
mouth!  Woe, woe, to him that putteth his hand to the plough and looketh
back!""  He laughed wildly and tossed out his arms.

""I think thou hast eaten of the Jamestown weed!"" said Landless fiercely.
""Collect thy senses, man! And speak something less loudly, or Roach’s
betrayal will be superfluous.  As to myself, if I curse not, I act; and
as for my motives for what you call lukewarmness, and I call common
humanity, you will please to let them alone!""

The excitement faded from the fanatic’s face, and he said more quietly,
""You are right, friend.  I was mad for a moment, mad to see that freedom
which is so near us so imperiled.  I meant not to quarrel with you who
have shown in the conduct of this work the discernment of a young
Daniel, yea, who have so borne yourself, that I have grown to care for
you as I never thought to care again for human being.  I have prayed
much that you should be brought from the twilight of Calvinism into the
pure light wherein walk the disciples of the blessed Ludovick.""

They reached the square and mingled with the motly crowd that lined its
sides, leaving the centre occupied only by the murderer, his captors,
and the master.  Followed by the Muggletonian, Landless made his way to
where the yellow locks of young Dick Whittington towered above the
crowd.  The boy saw him coming, and edging past a knot of blacks, met
him in a little open space, whose only occupants were two or three
women, and an Indian squatting upon the ground.  Leaning against a pine,
and fixing his gaze and, to all appearance, his attention upon the
central group where the overseer was just finishing a circumstantial
account of the chase, Landless said quietly:—

""You were of the party that took him?""

""That I was!"" answered the boy gleefully. ""Losh! but it was fun!""  His
blue eyes danced with impish delight; a noiseless laugh showed all his
strong white teeth.  ""We went straight to the spot where you and
Mistress Patricia saw him by the lightning. There the dogs struck his
trail and the fun commenced.  Over streams and fallen trees, and
chinquepin ridges; through bogs and myrtle thickets and miles of grape
vines—swounds! but it was hot work! Just look at the scratches on my
face and hands! Joyce Whitbread would n’t know me!  The Court spark, he
wore a mask and saved his beauty.  He’s a well-plucked one, though, took
the lead and kept it, and when it was over, treated us to usquebaugh at
Luckey Doughty’s store.  Well, we run the fox to earth in a Chickahominy
village.  Lord!  I ’m sorry for the half king of the Chickahominies!
He’ll have to answer to Governor and Council for letting red fox burrow
in his village.  Found him squatted in a sassafras patch.  Snarled and
fought and tried to bite like the beast he is.  Woodson and the Court
spark took him.""

""Do you know what will be done with him now?""

""He ’ll be taken on to the gaol at the court-house.""

""That is five miles from here,"" said Landless.

""Yes, near to the village where we took him.  He ’ll be kept there until
they can try him.  And they’ll make short work of him.  He ’ll be food
for crows directly.""

The throng pressed upon them, forcing them nearer to the group beneath
the dead tree.  The overseer had finished his account, and the master
was clearing his throat to speak.  Landless found himself upon the inner
verge of the mass of spectators, directly opposite the murderer, and
confronted by him with a look so dark, wild and malignant, that he could
not doubt the intention that lay behind those scowling eyes.  Luiz
Sebastian, still with the murderer’s arm in his grasp, gave him a
peculiar look which he could not translate. In the background he saw
Trail’s sinister face peering over the shoulder of an Indian.

""You dog!"" said the planter, addressing himself directly to Roach.
""What have you to say for yourself?""

The murderer made an uncertain sound with his dry lips, and his
bloodshot eyes roamed around the circle from one staring face to
another, until they returned to rest upon the watchful, amber-hued
countenance beside him.

""Speak!"" said his master sternly.

""I ’ll say nothing,"" was the dogged reply, ""until I stands my trial.  I
demands a fair trial.""

""Remember that this is your last chance to speak to me, to speak to any
one in authority before you are tried.  Of course you will hang for
this.  Have you anything to say?  Do you wish to speak to me in
private?""

The murderer raised his head, and shaking the tangled hair from about
his face, cast at Landless, standing ten paces beyond the planter, such
a look of deadly and blasting hatred, that for a moment the blood ran
cold in the young man’s veins.  He set his teeth and braced himself to
meet the blow at plans and hopes and life that should follow such a
look.

To his astonishment the blow did not fall.  Roach changed the basilisk
gaze with which he had regarded him to a vacant stare.

""I ’ve naught to say,"" he whined, ""except that I hopes your honor will
see that I has a fair trial—no d—d Tyburn or Newgate hocus-pocussing.""

The master beckoned to the overseer.  ""Take him away,"" he said.  ""Take
two or three men and carry him on to the gaol.""

He turned on his heel and walked to where Sir Charles Carew leaned
against a tree, idly flicking the mud from his boots with his riding
cane.  Landless standing near and listening with strained ears heard the
master say in answer to the other’s lifted brows:—

""Nothing to be learnt in that quarter.  If there ’s rebellion brewing,
he knows nothing of it.""

Fresh horses were brought from the stables.  ""You, Luiz Sebastian,
Taylor, and Mathew,"" said the overseer, swinging himself into the
saddle.  The men designated mounted, and Roach, bound and scowling, was
hoisted to his former seat behind Luiz Sebastian. The cavalcade started.
As the horse that bore the double load passed Landless, the murderer
twisted himself about in his seat, and, with a venomous look, spat at
him.  Luiz Sebastian smiled evilly.

The shaven head and fleshless face of Win-Grace Porringer protruded
themselves over Landless’s shoulder.

""What does it mean?"" he muttered.

""God knows,"" answered the other.  ""Come to the trysting place to-night.
We must act, and act quickly.""

That night ten men met in the deserted hut on the marsh, having stolen
with the caution of Indians from their respective plantations.  Five
were men who had fought at Edgehill and Naseby and Worcester, or had
followed Cromwell through the breach at Drogheda. Four were victims of
the Act of Uniformity; darker, sterner, more determined if possible,
than the veterans of the New Model.  The tenth man was Landless. When,
late at night, he and Porringer crept stealthily back to the quarters,
it was with the conviction that this was the last time they should so
steal through the darkness.  The date of the rising had been fixed for
the thirteenth of September; this night, by Landless’s advice, it was
brought forward to the tenth—and it was now the sixth.

Groping his way past the slumbering forms of the three other occupants
of his cabin, Landless threw himself down upon his pallet with a heavy
sigh.

""Liberty!"" he said beneath his breath.  ""Goddess, whom I and mine have
sought through long years, whom once we thought we held, and waked to
find thee gone,—once I thought thee fairer than aught beside; thought no
price too great to pay for thee.  But now!""

He hid his face in his hands with a stifled groan, When at length he
fell into a troubled sleep, it was to see again a storm-tossed boat, and
a woman’s face, set like a star against the blackness of the night.




                             *CHAPTER XIX*

                 *THE LIBRARY OF THE SURVEYOR-GENERAL*


At a long, low table stood Mistress Betty Carrington, her slender figure
enveloped in an apron of blue dowlas, her sleeves of fine holland rolled
above her elbows, and her white and rounded arms plunged deep into a
great bowl filled with the purple globes of the wild grape.  A row of
children knelt on the brick floor at her feet, busily stripping the
fruit from the stems, and negresses, hard by, strained with sinewy hands
the crimson juice from the pulpy mass into jars of earthenware.  To this
group suddenly entered a breathless urchin.

""Ohé, mistis! de Gov’nor an’ Massa Peyton comin’ up de road!""

Betty suspended her operations with a little cry. ""The Governor!"" she
exclaimed in dismay.  ""And my father is gone a-processioning;—and my
gown is not seemly;—and he cannot be kept waiting!""  She threw off her
apron, dipped her hands into the water the slaves poured for her, and
was at the hall door in time to courtesy to the Governor, as, followed
by a groom, and attended by Mr. Peyton, he rode up to the house.

With the agility of youth his Excellency sprung from his horse, threw
the reins to the groom, and advanced to greet the lady.  A richly laced
riding-suit became his still slight and elegant figure to a marvel; his
gilt-spurred, Spanish leather boots were of the newest, most approved
cut; his periwig was fresh curled, and framed with distinction a
handsome, if somewhat withered, countenance.  He doffed his Spanish hat
with a bow and flourish: Betty courtesied profoundly.

""Welcome to Rosemead, your Excellency.""

""I greet you well, pretty Mistress Betty,"" said the Governor, and took a
governor’s privilege.  Mr. Peyton looked as though he would have liked
to follow his Excellency’s example, but was fain to content himself with
the lady’s hand, resigned to the respectful pressure of his lips with a
charming blush and a dropping of long-fringed eyelids.

""Where is your father, sweetheart?"" demanded the Governor.

""Ah! your Excellency, he is unfortunate.  The vestry hath appointed this
day for the examination of boundaries in this parish, and as his
Majesty’s Surveyor-General he leads the procession.  But will not your
Excellency await his return?  He will be here anon, and with him Colonel
Verney.""

""Then will I wait, pretty one; for I have weighty matters to discuss
both with him and with Dick Verney.""

Betty ushered them into the great room, cool, dark, and fragrant of
roses.

""If your Excellency will permit me to withdraw, I will order some
refreshment for you after your long ride.""

The Governor sank into an armchair, and smiled graciously.

""Faith! a bit of pasty comes not amiss after a morning canter.  And
prithee see to the sack thyself, Mistress Betty.  And a dish of pippins
and cheese,"" continued the Governor, meditatively, ""and a rasher of
bacon.""

""There was a fine comb taken from the hive this morning.  Will your
Excellency choose a bit?  And there are dates, sent my father by the
captain of the Barbary vessel, and a quince tart—""

""We will taste of it all,"" said his Excellency, graciously, ""and
afterwards a pipe and a saucer of sweet scented, and your company, my
love.  Mr. Peyton, the lady may find the honeycomb too heavy for her
lifting.  We will excuse you to her assistance.""

""I am your Excellency’s most obedient servant,"" quoth Mr. Peyton with
due submission, and hastened after his blushing mistress.

The Governor, left alone, strolled to the window and looked out upon the
Chesapeake, lying blue and unruffled beneath the dazzling sunshine; to
the mantel-piece, and smelt of the roses in the blue china bowl; to the
spinet, and picked out ""Here ’s to Royal Charles"" with one finger;—and
finally brought up before a corner cupboard, found the key in the door,
turned it, and came upon the Surveyor-General’s library.

""H’m, what has he here?"" soliloquized his Excellency.  ""’Purchas; His
Pilgrimes,’ of course; ’General History of Virginia, New England and the
Summer Isles,’ well and good; ’Good News from Virginia,’ humph! that
must have been before my time; ’Public Good without Private Interest,’
humph! What’s this?  ’Areopagitica,’ John Milton!  John Hypocrite and
Parricide!  A pretty author, and a pretty cause he advocates,—I thank
God there are no schools and no printing presses in this colony, nor are
like to be,—and a courageous Surveyor-General to keep by him such
pestilent stuff in the present year of grace.  ’Abuses Stript and
Whipt,’ ’Anglia Rediva,’ ’Diary of Nehemiah Wallington,’ ’Bastwick’s
Litany!’  Miles Carrington, Miles Carrington! I have my eye on thee!
Thou hadst need to walk warily!  ’Zion’s Plea against Prelacy,’
damnation!  ’Speech of Mr. Hampden,’ death and hell! ’Eikonoklastes,’
may the foul fiend fly away with my soul!""

And the Governor closed the cupboard door with a bang, and, with a very
red and frowning face, went back to his seat, and there sank into a
reverie, which lasted until the entrance of Mistress Betty and Mr.
Peyton, followed by two slaves bearing an ample repast.

An hour later came home the Surveyor-General, bringing with him Colonel
Verney, Sir Charles Carew, and Captain Laramore.

The Surveyor-General made stately apologies to his Excellency for his
unavoidable absence: his Excellency, holding himself very erect, heard
him out, and then said coldly, ""Major Carrington may rest at ease. I was
sufficiently amused.""

""Truly the county knows Mr. Peyton’s powers of entertainment,"" said the
Surveyor-General with a bow and smile for that young gentleman.

""Mr. Peyton had other occupation,"" said the Governor dryly.  ""And I fear
that his is too cavalier a wit, and that his sonnets and madrigals savor
too much of loyalty to the Anointed of the Lord and to His Church to
have proved acceptable to the worshipful company with whom I have been
engaged.  I have to congratulate his Majesty’s Surveyor-General on the
possession of such a library as, I dare swear, is to be found in no
other house in this, his Majesty’s _loyal_ dominion of Virginia.""

Carrington glanced towards the cupboard, and bit his lip.

""I am pleased,"" he said stiffly, ""that your Excellency hath found
wherewithal to pass an idle hour.""

""It is, indeed, a choice collection,"" said the Governor, with a smooth
tongue, but with an angry light in his eyes.  ""May I ask by whom it was
chosen; who it was that so carefully culled nightshade and poison oak?""

""_I_ choose my own reading,"" said Carrington haughtily.  ""And I see not
why Sir William Berkeley should concern himself—""

""This passes!"" exclaimed the Governor, giving rein to his fury and
striking his hand against the table.  ""It doth concern me much, Major
Carrington, both as a true man, and as the Governor of this Colony, the
representative of his blessed Majesty, King Charles the Second, may all
whose enemies, private and open, be confounded! that a gentleman who
holds a high office in this Colony should have in his possession—ay! and
read, too, for ’t is a well-thumbed copy—that foul emanation from a
fouler mind, that malicious, outrageous, damnable, proscribed book,
called ’Eikonoklastes!’""

""If Sir William Berkeley doubts my loyalty—"" began Carrington fiercely.

""Major Carrington, you are too popular a man!"" broke in the Governor as
fiercely.  ""When, upon that black day, ten years ago, the usurper’s
frigates entered the Chesapeake, and taking us unprepared, compelled
(God forgive me!) my submission, who but Miles Carrington welcomed and
entertained the four commissioners (commissioners from a Roundhead
Parliament to a King’s Governor!)?  Who but Miles Carrington was hand in
glove with the shopkeeper Bennett and the renegade Matthews? Oh! they
used their power mildly, I deny it not!  They were gracious and
long-suffering; they left to the loyal gentlemen, their sometime
friends, life and lands; they contented themselves with banishing a
loyal Governor to his own manor-house, and not, as they might have done,
to the wilderness, to perish amongst the savages.  O, they were
exemplary despots! What, when a turn of Fortune’s wheel brought them up,
could grateful, loyal gentlemen, could a grateful King’s Governor do,
but follow the example set them and be civil to the officers of the late
Commonwealth, and something more than civil to the gentleman who so
gracefully avowed that he had but bowed to the times, and that the
restored sovereign had no more faithful subject than he?  When his
Majesty was graciously pleased to continue that gentleman (at the
solicitation of his loyal kindred at home) in the office of
Surveyor-General to this colony, sure, we all rejoiced.  It is not with
the past of Major Carrington that I quarrel; it is with the present.  In
his case, that which should speak loudest for his recovered loyalty is
wanting.  Others there are who have that witness.  Let Mr. Digges ride
abroad, and from his cabin-door some prick-eared cur cried out,
’Renegade!’  (Pardon me, the word is not mine.) The Oliverian and
schismatic servants spit at him. Is it so with Major Carrington?  By
G—d, no! These people uncover to him as though he were the arch rebel
himself.  Speak of his Majesty’s Surveyor-General before an Oliverian,
and the fellow pricks up his ears like a charger that scents the battle.
Nay, I am told that in their conventicles the schismatics pray for him,
that he may be brought back into the fold, and may become a second
Moses, and lead them out of Egypt!  Even the Quakers have a good word
for him.  Major Carrington asks me if I question his loyalty.  I answer
that I know not, but I do know that the discontented and mutinous of the
land do look upon him with too favorable a regard.  And his loyalty is
of that tender age that it may well be susceptible to the influence of
the evil eye.""  The Governor, who was now in a white heat of passion,
stopped for breath.

""Sir William Berkeley, you shall answer to me for this!"" said the
Surveyor-General, with white lips.

""With all the pleasure in life,"" said the Governor, clapping his hand to
his rapier.

Carrington folded his arms.  ""Not now,"" he said, with stern courtesy.
""I believe your Excellency sleeps at Verney Manor?  I, too, am invited
thither. There, and it please you, we will adjust our little difference.
For the present, you are my guest.""

The Governor choked down his passion, though with difficulty.  ""Till
to-night then—"" he began, when Colonel Verney interposed.

""Neither to-night, nor at any other time,"" he said sturdily.  ""Gadzooks!
have not his Majesty’s servants enough on hand without employing their
time in pinking one another?  Here are the Chickahominies restive, and
those plaguy Ricahecrians amongst us, and the Nansemond Independents
prophesying the end of the world, and the witches’ trial coming on, and
the Quakers to be routed out, and on top of it all this story that
Ludlow brings of a redemptioner’s assertion that there is afoot an
Oliverian plot.  And his Majesty’s Governor, and his Majesty’s
Surveyor-General with drawn rapiers!  For shame, gentlemen! Major
Carrington, my good friend and neighbor, for whose loyalty to our
present gracious sovereign I would answer for as I would for my own,
forget the hasty words which I am sure Sir William Berkeley already
regrets.  Come, Sir William, acknowledge that you were over-choleric.""

""I ’ll be d—d if I do!"" cried the Governor.

""We meet to-night,"" said the Surveyor-General.

The Colonel turned to Sir Charles Carew, who had been a highly amused
spectator of this little scene.

""Charles,"" he said impressively, ""report hath it that you have figured
in more affairs of honor than any man of your age at court.  You should
be a nice judge of such gear.  Join me in assuring these gentlemen that
they may be reconciled, and their honor receive not the least taint; and
so avert a duel which would be a scandal to the community, and a menace
to the state.""

Sir Charles glanced from the pacific Colonel to the sternly collected
Surveyor-General, and thence to the fiery Governor, whose white, jeweled
fingers twitched with impatience.

""Certainly, sir,"" he said lazily, ""you are welcome to my poor opinion,
which is that, considering the nature of the provocation, and the
standing of the parties, there is one way out of the affair with honor.""

""Exactly!"" said the Colonel eagerly.

Sir Charles locked his hands behind his head. ""There ’s a very pretty
piece of ground behind your orchard, sir,"" he said, dreamily regarding
the ceiling. ""I noticed it the other day, and sink me! if I did not wish
for Harry Bellasses with whom I have fought three times.  ’T is ever a
word and a blow with Harry!  The light just at sunset is excellent,
though your twilight cometh over soon.  May I venture to suggest to your
Excellency that your _riposte_ is more brilliant than safe?  Major
Carrington, your parade is somewhat out of fashion.  I could teach you
the newest French mode in five minutes.

""I am obliged for your offer, sir,"" said the Surveyor-General dryly.
""The other has served my turn, and must do so again.""

""Sir Charles Carew will do me the honor to be my second?"" asked the
Governor of that gentleman, who answered with a low bow, and a ""The
honor is mine.""

""Captain Laramore?"" said the Surveyor-General.

""At your service, Major,"" cried the Captain, a dashing, black-a-vised
personage, with large gold rings in his ears, a plume a yard long in his
castor, and a general Draweansir air.

""Will Captain Laramore fight?"" inquired Sir Charles.  ""I have had the
honor of changing the date for sailing for several gentlemen of his
profession.""

""Even so accomplished a swordsman as Sir Charles Carew is allowed to be,
hath yet a lesson to learn,"" said the doughty captain.

""And that is—""

""Pride shall have a fall—to-night.""

Sir Charles smiled politely.  ""The ship that is anchored off yonder
point is yours, is it not?  Would you not like to take a last look at
her?  Or to leave instructions for your lieutenant and successor?  There
is time for you to gallop to the point and back.""

""Am I to have the honor of crossing swords with you, Colonel Verney?""
asked Mr. Peyton.

""No, sir!"" exclaimed the vexed Colonel.  ""You are not!  I wash my hands
of this foolish fray. William Berkeley, I have never scrupled to tell
thee when I thought thee in the wrong.  I think so now. Charles, thou
art an impudent fellow!  I have it in my mind to wish that the Captain
may give thee the lesson he talks of.""

""Thank you, sir,"" drawled the gentleman addressed. ""Mr. Peyton looks
quite disconsolate.  Sink me! if it’s not a shame to leave him out in
the cold.  If he will wait his turn I will be happy to oblige him when I
have disposed of the Captain.""

""You will do no such thing!"" retorted his kinsman. ""Mr. Peyton, take
your hand off your sword!  At least there shall be two sane men at this
meeting.  I suppose, gentlemen, you agree with me that this affair
cannot be kept too private?  To that end you had best ride with me to
Verney Manor, and there have it out on this plot of ground Charles talks
of.  It is at least retired.""

""’T is a most sweet spot,"" said Sir Charles.

""Good!"" quoth the Governor.  ""And now that this little matter is
settled, I am once more, and for the present, sir, simply your obliged
guest and servant,"" and he bowed to the Surveyor-General.

Carrington returned the bow.  ""We will drink to our better acquaintance
to-night.  Pompey! the sack and the aqua vitae.  And, Pompey! a handful
of mint.""

The company fell to drinking, and then to tobacco. The Governor, whose
fits of passion were as short as they were violent, arrived by rapid
degrees at a pitch of high good humor.  The company listened gravely for
the fiftieth time to stories of the court of the first James; of
Buckingham’s amours, of the beauty of Henrietta Maria, of a visit to
Paris, an interview with Richelieu, a duel with a captain of
Mousquetaires, a kiss imprinted upon the fair hand of Anne of Austria.
The charmed stream of the old courtier’s reminiscences flowed on—he
stopped for breath, and Sir Charles took the word and proceeded to
unfold before their dazzled eyes a gorgeous phantasmagoria. The King,
the Duke, Sedley and Buckingham, Mesdames Castlemaine, Stuart and
Gwynne, Dryden and Waller and Lely, the King’s house, the Queen’s
chapel, the Queen’s duennas, the Tityre Tus, Paul’s Walk, the Russian
Ambassador, astrologers, orange girls, balls, masques, pageants, duels,
the court of Louis le Grand, the King’s hunting parties, Madame
d’Orleans, Olympe di Mancini.

The Governor listened with dilating nostrils and sparkling eyes; Colonel
Verney’s vexed countenance smoothed itself; Captain Laramore, sitting
with outstretched legs, and head hidden in clouds of tobacco smoke,
rumbled from out that obscurity laughter and strange oaths.  Even Mr.
Peyton, after vainly trying to fix his attention upon the construction
of a sonnet to his mistress’s eyebrow, succumbed to the enchantment, and
sat with parted lips, drinking in wonders; but the Surveyor-General,
though he listened courteously, listened with forced smiles and with an
attention which was hard to preserve from wandering.

In the midst of a brilliant account of the nuptials of the Chevalier de
Grammont came an interruption.

""De horses am fed an’ brought roun’, massa.""

The Governor started up.  ""Rat me, if good sack and good stories make
not a man forget all else beside!  Colonel Verney, I wish you, as
lieutenant of this shire, to ride with me to this Chickahominy village
where I have promised an audience to the half king of the tribe.  Plague
on the unreasonable vermin!  Why can they not give way peaceably?  If
the colony needs and takes their lands, it leaves them a plenty
elsewhere.  Let them fall back towards the South Sea.  Sir Charles, I
grieve for the necessity, but we must leave the court and come back to
the wilderness.  Gentlemen, will you ride with Verney and me, or shall
we part now to meet at sunset in his orchard?""

""We had best ride with your Excellency,"" said Carrington gravely.  ""I
like not the temper of the Chickahominies, who ever mean most when they
say least.  And these roving Ricahecrians, their guests, are of a
strange and fierce aspect.  It is as well to go in force.""

""Those vagrants from the Blue Mountains have been here overlong,"" said
the Governor.  ""I shall send them packing!  Well, gentlemen, since we
are to have the pleasure of your company, boot and saddle is the word!""




                              *CHAPTER XX*

                   *WHEREIN THE PEACE PIPE IS SMOKED*


The sun had some time passed the meridian when the party saw through the
widening glades of the forest the gleam of a great river, and upon its
bank an Indian village of perhaps fifty wigwams, set in fields of maize
and tobacco, groves of mulberries, and tangles of wild grape.  The
titanic laughter of Laramore and the drinking catch which Sir Charles
trolled forth at the top of a high, sweet voice had announced their
approach long before they pushed their horses into the open; and the
population of the village was come forth to meet them with song and
dance and in gala attire.  The soft and musical voices of the young
women raised a kind of recitative wherein was lauded to the skies the
virtue, wisdom and power of the white father who had come from the banks
of the Powhatan to those of the Pamunkey to visit his faithful
Chickahominies, bringing (beyond doubt) justice in his hand.  The deeper
tones of the men chimed in, and the mob of naked children, bringing up
the rear of the procession, added their shrill voices to the clamor,
which, upon the booming in of a drum and the furious shaking of the
conjurer’s rattle, became deafening.

The chant came to an end, but the orchestra persevered.  Ten girls left
the throng, formed themselves into line, and advancing one after the
other with a slow and measured motion, laid at the feet of the Governor
(who had dismounted) platters of parched maize, beans and chinquapins,
with thin maize cakes. They were succeeded by two stalwart youths
bearing, slung upon a pole between them, a large buck which they
deposited upon the ground before the white men. There came a tremendous
crash from the drum, and a discordant scream from a long pipe made of a
reed. The crowd opened, and from out their midst stalked a venerable
Indian.

""My fathers are welcome,"" he said gravely.

""Where is the half king?"" demanded the Governor sharply.  ""I have no
time for these fooleries. Make them stop that infernal racket, and lead
us to your chiefs at once.""

The Indian frowned at this cavalier reception of the village civilities,
but he waved his arm for the music to cease, and proceeded to conduct
the visitors through a lane made by two rows of dusky bodies and staring
faces, to a large wigwam in the centre of the village.  Before this hut
stood a mulberry tree of enormous size, and seated upon billets of wood
in the shade of its spreading branches were the half king of the tribe
and the principal men of the village.

Their faces and the upper portions of their bodies were painted red—the
color of peace.  They wore mantles of otter skins, and from their ears
depended strings of pearl and bits of copper.  To the earring of the
half king were attached two small, green snakes that twisted and writhed
about his neck; his body had been oiled and then plastered with small
feathers of a brilliant blue, and upon his head was fastened a stuffed
hawk with extended wings.

To one side of this group stood a band of Indians, two score or more in
number, who differed in appearance and attire from the Chickahominies.
The iron had entered the soul of the latter; they had the bearing of a
subject race.  Not so with the former.  They were men of great size and
strength, with keen, fierce faces; their clothing was of the scantiest
possible description; ornaments they had, but of a peculiar
kind—necklaces and armlets of human bones, belts in which long tufts of
silk grass were interwoven with a more sinister fibre.  They leaned on
great bows, and each sternly motionless figure looked a bronze Murder.

The chief of the Chickahominies raised his eyes from the ground as the
Governor and his party entered the circle.  ""My white fathers are
welcome,"" he said.  ""Let them be seated,"" and looked at the ground
again.  The ""white fathers"" took possession of half a dozen billets, and
waited in silence the next move of the game.  After a while, the half
king lifted from the log beside him a pipe with a stem a yard long and a
bowl in which an orange might have rested.  An Indian, rising, went to
where a fire burned beneath a tripod, and returning with a live coal
between his fingers, calmly and leisurely lighted the pipe.  The half
king, still in dead silence, lifted it to his lips, smoked for five
minutes, and handed it to the Indian, who bore it to the Governor.  The
Governor drew two or three tremendous whiffs and passed it on to Colonel
Verney, who in his turn transferred it to the Surveyor-General.  When
the monster pipe had been smoked by each of the white men, it went the
round of the savages.  An Indian summer haze began to settle around the
company.  Through it the patient gazing throng on the outskirts of the
circle became shadowy, impalpable; the face of the half king, now hidden
in shifting smoke wreaths, now darkly visible, like that of an eastern
idol before whom incense is burned.  There was no sound save the wash of
the waters below them, the sighing of the wind, the drone of the cicadas
in the trees.  The Indians sat like statues, but the white men were more
restive.  The elders managed to restrain their impatience, but Laramore
began to whistle, and when checked by a look from the Governor, turned
to Sir Charles with a comically disconsolate face and a shrug of the
shoulders.  Whereupon the latter drew from his pocket, dice and a
handful of gold pieces.  Laramore’s face brightened, and the two,
screened from observation by the Colonel’s shoulders, which were of the
broadest, fell to playing noiselessly, cursing beneath their breath.
Mr. Peyton leaned his elbow on his knee, and his chin upon his hand, and
allowed the dreamy beauty of the afternoon to overflow a poetic soul.

At length, and when the patience of the whites was well-nigh exhausted,
the pipe came back to where the half king sat with lowered eyes and
impassive face. He laid it down beside him and rose to his feet,
gathering his mantle around him.

""My white fathers are welcome,"" he said in a sonorous voice.  ""Very
welcome to the Chickahominies is the face of the white father, who rules
in the place of the great white father across the sea.  Their corn feast
is not yet, and yet my people rejoice.  Our hearts were glad when my
father sent word that he would this day visit his faithful
Chickahominies. Our ears are open: let my father speak.""

""I thank Harquip and his people for their welcome,"" said the Governor
coldly.  ""I have ever found them full of words.  They profess loyalty to
the great white father beyond the seas, but they forget his good laws
and disobey his officers.  I am weary of their words.""

""Tell me,"" said Harquip, with a sombre face, ""are they good laws which
drive us from our hunting grounds?  Are they good laws which take from
us our maize fields?  Does the great white father love to hear our women
cry for food? or is his heart Indian and longs for the sound of the war
whoop?""

""That is a threat,"" the Governor said sternly.

The Indian waved his hands.  ""Have we not smoked the peace pipe?"" he
said coldly.

""Humph!"" said the Governor then, ""I am not come to listen to idle
complaints.  Your grievances as to the land shall be laid before the
next Assembly, and it will pass judgment upon them—justly and
righteously, of course.""

""Ugh!"" said the Indian.

""I am here,"" continued the Governor, ""to ask certain questions of the
Chickahominies, and to lay certain commands upon them which they will do
well to obey.""

""Let my father speak,"" said the Indian calmly.

""Why did you shelter in your village the man with the red hair?  Word
was sent to all the tribes, to the Nansemonds, the Wyanokes, the
Cheskiacks, the Paspaheghs, the Pamunkeys, the Chickahominies, that he
should be delivered up if they found him among them.  Why did the
Chickahominies hide him?""

""In the night time, the red fox came to the village of the
Chickahominies and burrowed there.  The eyes of my people were closed:
they saw him not.""

""Humph!  Why did you not carry your guns to the Court House when the
tribes were ordered to do so, a fortnight ago, and leave them there,
taking in exchange roanoke and fire-water?""

""My fathers asked much,"" said the half king gloomily.  ""My young men
love their sticks-that-speak. They love to see the deer go down before
them like maize before the hail storm.  My fathers asked much.""

""How many guns has your village?""

""Five,"" was the prompt reply.

""Humph!  To-morrow you will deliver ten guns to the captain of the
trainband at the court-house.  When do these men,"" pointing to the
stranger band, ""return to their tribe?""

""They are our friends.  They wait to dance the corn dance with us.  Then
will they return to the Blue Mountains, and will tell the Ricahecrians
of the great things they have seen, and of the wisdom and power of my
white fathers.""

""When is your corn feast?""

""Seven suns hence.""

""They must be gone to-morrow.""

The face of the half king darkened, and there was a slight, instantly
repressed movement among the circle of braves.

""My father asks very much,"" said the half king with emphasis.

""Not more than I can, and will, enforce,"" said the Governor sternly, and
getting to his feet as he spoke. ""You, Harquip, shall be answerable to
me and to the Council for these men’s departure to-morrow.  If by
sunrise of the next morning their canoes are far up the river, headed
for the Blue Mountains, if by the same hour the guns which you have
retained in defiance of the express decree of the Assembly, be given up
to those at the Court House, then will I overlook your hiding the man
with the red hair, and the Assembly will listen to your complaints as to
your hunting grounds.  Disobey, and my warriors shall come, each with a
stick-that-speaks in his hand.  I have spoken,"" and the Governor
beckoned to the servants who held the horses.

The half king rose also.  ""My white father shall be obeyed,"" he said
with gloomy dignity.  ""He is stronger than we.  Otee has been angry with
the real men for many years.  He is gone over to the palefaces and helps
their god against the real men.  My young men shall take their guns back
to the palefaces to-morrow, and shall bring back fire-water, and we will
drink, and forget that the days of Powhatan are past and that Otee
fights against us.  Also when the Pamunkey is red with to-morrow’s
sunset, my brothers from the Blue Mountains shall turn their faces
homewards.  My father is content?""

""I am content,"" said the Governor.

""There is a thing which my brothers have to say to my white fathers,""
continued the half king.  ""Will they hear the great chief, Black Wolf?""

The Governor pulled out a great watch, glanced at it, and sighed
resignedly.  ""Gentlemen, have patience a moment longer.  Harquip, I will
listen to the Ricahecrian until the shadow of that tree reaches the
fire.  What says he?""

The half king spoke to the strangers in their own tongue—their ranks
broke, and an Indian stalked forward to the centre of the circle.  His
tall, powerful, nearly nude figure was thickly tatooed with
representations of birds and beasts; he wore an armlet of a dull, yellow
metal (""Gold! by the Eternal!"" ejaculated the Governor to Colonel
Verney); over his naked, deeply scarred breast hung three strings of
hideous mementoes of torture stakes; the belt that held tomahawk and
scalping knife was fringed with human hair; beside his streaming
scalplock was stuck the dried hand of an enemy.  The face beneath was
cunning, relentless, formidable.  He spoke in his own language, and the
half king translated.

""Black Wolf is a great chief.  In his village in the Blue Mountains are
fifty wigwams—the largest is his.  There are a hundred braves—he leads
the war parties.  The Monacans run like deer, the hearts of the
Tuscaroras become soft, they hide behind their squaws!  Black Wolf is a
great chief.  Seven moons of cohonks have passed since the Ricahecrians
sharpened their hatchets and came down from the mountains to where the
waters of Powhatan fall over many rocks.  There they met the palefaces.
The One above all was angry with his Ricahecrians.  They saw for the
first time the guns of the palefaces.  They thought they were gods who
spat fire at them and slew them with thunder.  Their hearts became soft,
and they fled before the strange gods.  Some the palefaces slew, and
some they took prisoner.  Black Wolf saw his brother, the great chief
Grey Wolf, fall.  The Ricahecrians went back to the Blue Mountains, and
their women raised the death chant for those whom they left stretched
out on the bank of the great river.... Seven times had the maize
ripened, when Black Wolf led a war party against a tribe that dwelt on
the banks of the Pamunkey where a fallen pine might span it.  The waters
ran red with blood.  When there were no more Monacans to kill, when the
fires had burnt low, Black Wolf looked down the waters of the Pamunkey.
He had heard that it ran into a great water that was salt, whose further
bank a man could not see.  He had heard that the palefaces rode in
canoes that had wings, great and white.  He thought he would like to
know if these things were true, or if they were but tales of the singing
birds.  To find out, Black Wolf and his young men dipped their oars into
the water of the Pamunkey, and rowed towards the moonrise.  In the
morning they met twenty men of the Pamunkeys in three canoes.  The
Pamunkeys lie deep in the slime of the river; the eels eat them; their
scalps shall hang before the wigwams of Black Wolf and his young men.
In the afternoon, they drove their canoes into the reeds and went into
the forest to find meat.  Black Wolf’s arrow brought down a buck and
they feasted.  Afterwards they caught a hunter who saw only the deer he
was chasing.  They tied him to a tree and made merry with him.  When he
was dead, they drew their boats from out the reeds, and rowed on down
the broadening river.  The next day, at the time of the full sun-power,
they came to this village.  Many years before the palefaces came, the
Chickahominies were a great nation, reaching to the foot of the Blue
Mountains, and then were they and the Ricahecrians friends and allies.
When Black Wolf showed them the totem of his tribe upon his breast, they
welcomed him and his young men.  That was ten suns ago.  Black Wolf and
his young men have seen many things.  When they go back to the Blue
Mountains, the Ricahecrians will think they listen to singing birds.
They will tell of the great salt water, of the boats with wings, of the
palefaces, of their fields of maize and tobacco, of the black men who
serve them, of their temples, werowanees and women.  They will tell of
the great white father who rules, of his power, his wisdom, his open
hand—""

""I thought it would come at last,"" quoth the Governor.  ""What does he
want, Harquip?""

""The Ricahecrian starts for his wigwam in the Blue Mountains to-morrow
as my father commands. He says: ’Shall I not return to my people with a
gift from the great white father in my hand?’""

The Governor laughed.  ""Let one of your young men go to the court-house.
I will give him an order for beads, for a piece of red cloth, and yes,
rat me! he shall have a mirror!  I hope he is satisfied!""

The half king’s eyes gleamed covetously.  ""My father gives large gifts.
He has indeed an open hand. But the Ricahecrian desires another thing.
He says: ’Seven years ago, at the falls of the Powhatan, Black Wolf saw
his brother fall before the stick-that-speaks of the palefaces.  Grey
Wolf was a great chief.  The village in the Blue Mountains mourned very
much.  Nicotee, his squaw, went wailing into the land of shadows.  His
son hath seen but seven moons of corn, but he dreams of the day when he
shall sharpen the hatchet against the slayers of his father....  The
Chickahominies have told Black Wolf that his brother was wounded and not
slain by the palefaces.  They brought him captive to their great board
wigwams.  There they tied him not to the torture stake; they knew that a
Ricahecrian laughs at the pine splinters.  They tortured his spirit.
They made him a woman.  The great chief of the Ricahecrians no longer
throws the tomahawk—the guns of the palefaces are about him.  He dances
the corn dance no more—his back is bowed with burdens. His arrow brings
not down the fleeing deer, he tracks not the bear to his den—he toils
like a squaw in the fields of the palefaces.  Black Wolf says to the
white father: ’Give back the Sagamore to the Ricahecrians, to his son,
to the village by the falling stream in the Blue Mountains.  Then will
the Ricahecrians be friends with the palefaces forever.  To-morrow Black
Wolf and his young men row towards the sunset; let the captive chief be
in their midst.  This is the gift which Black Wolf asks of his white
fathers.  He has spoken.’""

In the midst of a dead silence the half king took his seat and studied
the ground.  The Chickahominies, squatted round the circle, stirred not
a finger, and the outer row of spectators, motionless against a
background of interlacing branches patched with vivid blue, seemed a
procession in tapestry.  The Ricahecrians and their formidable chief
maintained a stony gloom. Whatever interest they felt in the fate of
their captive chief was carefully concealed.  The sun, now hanging,
broad and red, low in the heavens might have been the Gorgon’s head and
the whole village staring at it.

The Governor began to laugh.  Sir Charles chimed in musically and
Laramore followed suit.  The Surveyor-General frowned, but the Colonel,
after one or two attempts at sobriety of demeanor, succumbed, and the
trio became a quartette.  The glades of the forest rang to the jovial
sound—it was as though there were enchantment in the golden afternoon,
or in the ring of dark and frowning countenances before them, for they
laughed as though they would never stop. Even the servants at the
horses’ heads were infected, and laughed at they knew not what.

The Surveyor-General lost patience.  ""I think the Jamestown weed groweth
in these woods,"" he said dryly.

The Governor pulled himself together.  ""Faith!  I believe you are
right!"" he said airily.  ""But rat me! if the impudence of the varlets be
not the most amusing thing since the Quaker’s plea for toleration!""

""The amusement seems to be on our side,"" said the Surveyor-General.

The Governor cast a careless glance in the direction indicated by the
other.  ""Pshaw! a fit of the sulks! They will get over it.  Is this
precious captive the giant whom I have seen at Rosemead, Major
Carrington?""

""Not so, your Excellency.  My man is a Susquehannock.""

""I believe I may lay claim to the fellow, Sir William,"" said the
Colonel, wiping his eyes.

""Is he the Indian who was whipt the other day?"" asked Sir Charles,
taking snuff.

""For stealing fire-water—yes.""

The Governor began to laugh again.  ""Of course you will release the
rascal, Colonel?  The Blue Mountains threaten war if you do not.  Fling
yourself into the breach, and so prevent a ’scandal to the community and
a menace to the State,’ to quote your words of this morning.
Consistency is a jewel, Dick the Peacemaker.  Wherefore let the savage
go.""

""I ’ll be d—d if I do!"" cried the Colonel.

The Governor, shaking with laughter, got to his feet.  At a signal his
groom brought up his horse and held the stirrup for him to mount.  His
Excellency swung himself into the saddle and gathered the reins into his
gauntleted hands; the remainder of the company, too, got to horse.  The
Governor’s steed, a fiery, coal black Arabian, danced with impatience.

""Selim scents a fray!"" cried his Excellency. ""Come on, gentlemen!
’Twill be sunset before we reach that sweet piece of earth behind
Verney’s orchard.""

The half king rose from his scat, took three measured strides, and stood
side by side with the Ricahecrian chief.

""My white father will give to the Ricahecrian the gift he asks?""

A gust of passion took the Governor.  ""No!"" he thundered, turning in his
saddle.  ""The Ricahecrian may go to the devil and the Blue Mountains
alone!""  He struck spurs into his horse’s sides.  ""Gentlemen, we waste
time!""

The Arabian dashed down one of the winding glades of the forest; the
remainder of the party spurred their horses into the mad gallop known as
the ""planter’s pace,"" and in an instant the whole cavalcade had whirled
out of sight.  A burst of laughter, made elfin by distance, came back to
the village on the banks of the Pamunkey, then all was quiet again.  The
gold-laced, audacious company had vanished like a troop of powerful
enchanters, leaving behind them a sullen throng of native genii, kept
down by a Solomon’s Seal which is _not_ always unbreakable.

Something stirred in the midst of the great mulberry tree, a tree so
vast and leafy that it, might have hidden many things.  A man swung
himself down with a lithe grace from limb to limb, and finally dropped
into the circle of Indians who stood or sat in a sombre stillness which
might mean much or little. Only on the outskirts the crowd of women,
children and youths, had commenced a low, monotonous, undefined noise
which had in it something sinister, ominous.  It was like the sound,
dull and heavy, of the ground swell that precedes the storm.  The man
who dropped from the tree was Luiz Sebastian, and his appearance seemed
in no degree to surprise the Indians.  There followed a short and
sententious conversation between the mulatto, the half king and the
Ricahecrian chief.  Beside the half king lay the still smoking peace
pipe.  When the colloquy was ended, he raised it.  At a signal an Indian
brought water in a gourd, and into it the half king plunged the glowing
bowl.  The fire went out in a cloud of hissing steam. The sound of the
ground swell became louder and more threatening.




                             *CHAPTER XXI*

                               *THE DUEL*


The trees of the orchard stood out black against a crimson sky.  ""Faith!
it is a color we shall see more of presently,"" said Laramore, divesting
himself of his doublet.

His antagonist, passing a laced handkerchief along a gleaming blade,
smiled politely.  ""A pretty tint. Wine, the lips of women, Captain
Laramore’s blood—Lard! ’t is a color I adore!""

""Gentlemen!"" cried Colonel Verney.  ""Once more I beg of you to forego
this foolish quarrel.  William Berkeley, for the first time in your
life, be reasonable!""

The Governor turned sharply, his chest, beneath his shirt of finest
holland, swelling, each closely cropped hair upon his head, bared for
action, stiff with injured dignity.

""Colonel Richard Verney forgets himself,"" he began angrily; then,
""Confound you, Dick! keep your hands out of this.  I don’t want to fight
you too!  I say not that this gentleman is disloyal, but I do say, and I
will maintain it with the last drop of my blood, that he strives to draw
to himself a party in the State, with what intent he best knows.  If he
choose to pocket that assertion and withdraw, I am content.""

""On guard, sir,"" said Carrington, raising his sword.

The Colonel shrugged his shoulders, and returned to his post beside Mr.
Peyton.

""Very well, gentlemen, since you will not be ruled. Are you ready?""

The rapiers clashed together, and the game began.

The Governor fenced brilliantly, if a trifle wildly; his antagonist with
a cool steadiness of manner and an iron wrist.  Laramore fought with
bull-like ferocity, striving to beat down his opponent’s guard, making
mad lunges, stamping, and keeping up a continuous rumble of oaths.  Sir
Charles, always smiling, and with an air as if his thoughts were
anywhere but at that particular spot, put aside his thrusts with the
ease with which the toreador avoids the bull.

Mr. Peyton was moved to reluctant admiration. ""When I was in London,
sir,"" he said in an excited whisper to the Colonel, ""I did see Mathews
fight with Westwicke, and thought I had seen fencing indeed, but your
cousin—ah!""

Laramore’s sword described a curve in the air, and lodged in the boughs
of an apple-tree, while its owner staggered forward and fell heavily to
the ground.  At the same instant Carrington wounded the Governor in the
wrist.  Colonel Verney struck up the weapons. ""By the Lord, gentlemen!
you shall go no further! Jack Laramore’s down, run through the shoulder!
Major Carrington, you have drawn blood—it is enough.""

""If Sir William Berkeley is content,"" began Carrington, bowing to his
antagonist.

""Rat me!  I ’ve no choice,"" said the Governor ruefully.  ""You’ve
disabled my sword arm, and the gout has the other.""

""I shall be happy to wait until the wound shall have healed,"" said the
Surveyor-General, with another bow.

""No, no,"" said his Excellency, with a laugh.  ""We ’ll cry quits.  And
rat me! if now that we have had it out, I do not love thee better, Miles
Carrington, than ever I did before.  In the morning when thou goest
home, burn thy library, burn Milton and Bastwick, and Withers, and the
rest of the rogues, forswear such rascally company forever, and rat me!
if I will not maintain that thou art the honestest, as well as the
longest-headed, man in the colony.  There ’s my hand on it, and to-night
we ’ll have a rouse such as would make old Noll turn in his grave if he
had one.""

Carrington took the proffered hand courteously, if coldly.  ""I thank
your Excellency for your advice. Your Excellency should have your wound
attended to at once.  You are losing a deal of blood.""

""Tut, a trifle!"" said the Governor, airily, winding a handkerchief about
the bleeding member.

""Is there ever a chirugeon upon the place?"" asked Sir Charles in his
most dulcet tones.  ""If not, I fear that Captain Laramore will very
shortly make his last voyage.""

""Egad! that will never do!"" cried the Colonel, dropping upon his knees
beside the wounded man. ""A bad thrust!  Charles, thou art the very
devil!""

""Shall I ride for the doctor?"" cried Mr. Peyton.

""No.  Anthony Nash is at the house.  Run, lad, and fetch him.  He is
surgeon as well as divine.""

Mr. Peyton disappeared; and presently there stood in the midst of the
group gathered about the unconscious captain, a man clad in a clerical
dress and of a very dignified and scholarly demeanor.

""Ha, gentlemen!"" he said gravely, looking with bright, dark eyes from
one to the other.  ""This is a sorry business.  Shirts, drawn rapiers,
trampled turf, Sir William bleeding, Captain Laramore senseless upon the
ground!  His Excellency the Governor; Major Carrington, the
Surveyor-General; Colonel Verney, the lieutenant of the
shire;—scandalous, gentlemen!""

""And Anthony Nash who would give his chance of a mitre to have been one
of us,"" cried the Governor. ""Ha!  Anthony! dost remember the fight
behind Paul’s, three to one,—and the baggage that brought it about?""

The divine, on his knees beside Laramore, looked up with a twinkle in
his eye from his work of tying laced handkerchiefs into bandages.  ""That
was in the dark ages, your Excellency.  My memory goeth not back so far.
Ha! that is better!  He is coming to himself.  It is not so bad after
all.""

Laramore groaned, opened his eyes, and struggled into a sitting posture.

""Blast me! but I am properly spitted.  Sir Charles Carew, my compliments
to you.  You are a man after my own heart.  Ha, your Excellency!  I find
myself in good company.  Dr. Anthony Nash, I shall have you out!  You
have torn the handkerchief Mistress Lettice Verney gave me.""

The Doctor laughed.  ""You must be got to the house at once, and to bed,
where Mistress Lettice, who is as skillful in healing as in making
wounds, shall help me to properly dress this one.""

Laramore staggered to his feet.  ""Give me an arm, Doctor; and Peyton,
clap my periwig upon my head, will you? and fetch me my sword from where
I see it, adorning yonder bough.  Sir Charles Carew, I am your humble
servant.  Damme! it’s no disgrace to be worsted by the best sword at
Whitehall.""  And the gallant captain, supported by the clergyman and Mr.
Peyton, reeled off the ground; the remainder of the party waiting only
to assume doublets and wigs before following him to the house.

Two hours later Sir Charles Carew rose from the supper-table, and
leaving the gentlemen at wine, passed into the great room, and came
softly up to Patricia, sitting at the spinet.

""My heart was not there,"" he said, answering her smile and lifted brows.
""I am come in search of it.""

She laughed, fingering the keys.  ""Did you leave it on the field of
honor?  Fie, sir, for shame! Doctor Nash says that Captain Laramore will
not use his arm for a fortnight.""

""What—"" said Sir Charles, dropping his voice and leaning over her—""what
if I had been the wounded one?""

""I would have made your gruel with great pleasure, cousin.""

She laughed again, and looked at him half tenderly, half mockingly.
There were silver candlesticks upon the spinet and the light from the
tall wax tapers fell with a white radiance over the slender figure in
brocade and lace, the gleaming shoulders, the beautiful face, and the
shining hair.  Her eyes were brilliant, her mouth all elusive, mocking,
exquisite curves.

He raised a wandering lock of gold to his lips. ""The King hath written,
commanding me home to England,"" he said abruptly.

""Yes, my father told me.  He says the King loves you much.""

Sir Charles left her side, twice walked the length of the room, and came
back to her.  ""Am I to go as I came—alone?"" he asked, standing before
her with folded arms.

""If you so desire, sir?""

""Will you go with me?""

""Yes.""

He caught her in his arms; but she cried out and freed herself.

""No, no, not yet!"" she said breathlessly.  ""Listen to me.""

She moved backwards a step or two, and stood facing him, her hand at her
bosom, a color in her cheek, her eyes like stars.  ""I do not know that I
love you, Sir Charles Carew.  At times I have thought that I did; at
times, not.  There is an unrest here,"" touching her heart, ""which has
come to me lately.  I do not know—it may be the beginning of love.  Last
night my father had much talk with me.  It is his dearest wish that you
and I should wed.  He has been my very good father always.  If you will
take me as I am, not loving you yet, but with a heart free to learn,
why—""  Her voice broke.

Sir Charles flung himself at her feet, and, taking possession of her
hands, covered them with kisses.  A voice passed the window, singing
through the night:—

    ""Martinmas wind, when wilt thou blow,
      And shake the green leaves from the tree;
    O gentle death, when wilt thou come?
      For of my life I am weary.""


""Margery again?"" said Sir Charles, rising.

""Yes,"" said Patricia, with a troubled voice.

The voice began the stanza again:—

    ""Martinmas wind, when wilt thou blow,
      And shake the green leaves from the tree?""


""What is the matter?"" cried Sir Charles in alarm.

Patricia stared at him with wide, unseeing eyes. ""Martinmas wind,"" she
said in a low, clear, even voice.  ""Martinmas wind!  The leaves drift in
clouds, yellow and red, red like blood.  Look at the river flowing in
the sunshine!  And the tall gray crags!  Ah!"" and she put her hands
before her face.

""What is it?"" cried her suitor.  ""What is the matter?  You are ill!""

She dropped her hands.  ""I am well now,"" she said tremulously.  ""I do
not know what it was.  I had a vision—"" she broke into wild laughter.

""I am fey, I think,"" she cried.  ""Let me go to my room; I am better
there.""

He held the door open, and she passed him quickly with lowered eyes.  He
watched her run up the stairs, and then threw himself into a chair and
stared thoughtfully at the floor.




                             *CHAPTER XXII*

                       *THE TOBACCO HOUSE AGAIN*


The master of Verney Manor and his guests slept late, for the carouse of
the night before had been deep and prolonged.  The master’s daughter
rose with the sun, and went down into the garden, and thence through the
wicket into the mulberry grove, where she found Margery sitting on the
ground, tieing goldenrod to her staff.  ""Come and walk with me,
Margery,"" she said.

Margery rose with alacrity.  ""Where shall we go?"" she asked in a
whisper.  ""To the forest?  There were eyes in the forest last night, not
the great, still, solemn eyes that stare at Margery every night, but
eyes that glowed like coals, and moved from bush to bush.  Margery was
afraid, and she left the forest, and sat by the water side all night,
listening to what it had to say.  A star shot, and Margery knew that a
soul was on its way to Paradise, where she would fain go if only she
could find the way....  There are purple flowers growing by the creek
between the cedar wood and the marsh.  Let us go gather them, and trim
Margery’s staff very bravely.""

""I care not where we go,"" said her mistress. ""There as well as
elsewhere.""

""Come, then,"" said Margery, and took the lead.

When they had entered the strip of cedars which lay between the wide
fields and the point of land on which stood the third tobacco house,
Patricia stopped beneath a great tree.  ""We will go no further,
Margery,"" she said.

Margery objected.  ""The purple flowers grow by the water side.""

""Do you go and gather them then,"" said Patricia wearily.  ""I will wait
for you here.""

Margery glided away, and her mistress sat down upon the dark-red earth
at the foot of the tree.  There was a cold and sombre stillness in the
wood.  The air smelt chill and dank, and the light came through the low,
closely woven roof of foliage, as though it were filtered through crape,
but at the end of the vista of trees shone a glory of sea and sky and
gold-green marsh.  Patricia gazed with dreamy eyes.  ""It is all fair,""
she said.  ""What was it that Dr.  Nash read? ’My lines are fallen in
pleasant places.’  Riches and honor, and, they say, beauty, and many to
love me.—O Lord God!  I wish for happiness!""  She laid her cheek against
the cool earth, and the splendor before her wavered into a mist of rose
and azure.  ""Why should I weep,"" she said, ""that my lines are laid in
pleasant places?""

Margery with her arms filled with flowers appeared at her side.  ""Here
are the purple flowers,"" she said. ""Here is farewell-summer for me and a
passion-flower for you.""  She threw the blooms upon the ground, and
sitting down at her mistress’s feet, began to weave them into garlands.
Presently she took up the passion-flower.  ""This grew beside the tobacco
house, close to the wall.  Margery saw it, and ran to pluck it.  The
door of the tobacco house was closed, but above the passion-flower was a
great crack between the logs.""  She began to laugh.  ""Margery heard a
strange thing, while she was plucking the passion-flower. Shall she tell
it to you?""

""If you like, Margery,"" said Patricia indifferently.

Margery leaned forward, and laid a cold, thin hand upon her mistress’
arm.

""There were seven men in the tobacco house.  One said, ’When the
Malignants are put down, what then?’ and another answered, ’Surely we
will possess their lands and their houses, their silver and their gold,
for is it not written, ""The Lord hath given them a spoil unto their
servants.""’  Then the first said, ’Shall we not kill the Malignant,
Verney?’  Margery heard no more.  She came away.""

Patricia rose to her feet, pale, with brilliant eyes.

""You heard no more?""

""No.""

""Margery, show me the place where you listened.""

Margery took up her staff, and led the way to the outskirts of the wood.
""There,"" she said, pointing with her staff.  ""There, where the elder
grows.""

Patricia laid her hand on the mad woman’s shoulder. ""Listen to me,
Margery,"" she said in a low, distinct voice.  ""Listen very carefully.
Go quickly to the great house, and to my father, or to Woodson, or to
Sir Charles Carew give the message I am about to give you.  Do you
understand, Margery?""

Margery nodding emphatically, Patricia gave the message, and watched her
flit away through the gloom of the cedars into the sunlight beyond; then
turned and went swiftly and noiselessly across the strip of field to the
tall, dark, windowless tobacco house.  As she neared it, there came to
her a low and undistinguishable murmur of voices which rose into
distinctness as she entered the clump of alders.

Within the tobacco house were assembled the Muggletonian, the man
branded upon the forehead, the youth with the hectic cheek (who acted as
Secretary to the Surveyor-General), two newly purchased servants of
Colonel Verney, Trail and Godfrey Landless. In the uncertain light which
streamed from above through rents in the roof and crevices between the
upper logs the interior of the tobacco house looked mysterious,
sinister, threatening.  Here and there tobacco still hung from the poles
which crossed from wall to wall, and in the partial light the long,
dusky masses looked wonderfully like other hanging things. The great
casks beneath had the appearance of shadowy scaffolds, and the men,
sitting or standing against them, looked larger than life.  All was
dusk, subdued, save where a stray sunbeam, sifting through a crack in
the opposite wall, lit the ghastly face and shaven crown of the
Muggletonian.

Landless, leaning against a cask, addressed a man of a grave and
resolute bearing—one of the newly acquired servants of Verney Manor.

""Major Havisham, you are a wise and a brave man. I will gladly listen to
any counsel you may have to give anent this matter.""

Havisham shook his head.  ""I have nothing to say. The spirit of the
father lives in the son.  Skillful in planning, bold in action was
Warham Landless!""

""I am but the tool of Robert Godwyn,"" said Landless. ""You approve, then,
of our arrangements?""

""Entirely.  It is a daring enterprise, but if it succeeds—"" he drew a
long breath.

""And if it fails,"" said Landless, ""there is freedom yet.""

The other nodded.  ""Yes, death hath few terrors for us.""

""What is death?"" cried the hectic youth.  ""A short, dim passage from
darkness into light; the antechamber of the white court of God; the
curtain that we lift; the veil that we tear—and SEE!  My soul longeth
for death, yea, even fainteth for the courts of God!  But He will not
call His servants until His work is done.  Wherefore let us haste to
rise up and slay, to work the Lord’s work, and go from hence!""

""Yea!"" cried the Muggletonian.  ""I fear not death!  I fear not the
Throne and the Judgment seat. The Two Witnesses will speak for me!  But
Death is not upon us; he passeth by the weak, and seizeth upon the
strong.  The Malignants shall die, for the word of the Lord has gone out
against them.  ’Thy foot shall be dipped in the blood of thy enemies,
and the tongue of thy dogs into the same!  They shall fall by the sword,
they shall be a portion for foxes; as smoke is drawn away so shall they
vanish, as wax melteth before the fire so shall they perish!  He that
sitteth in the heavens shall have them in derision. And the righteous
shall rejoice in His vengeance!’""

""Amen,"" drawled Trail through his nose.  ""Verily, we will fatten on the
good things of the land, we will spend our days in ease and
pleasantness!  The Malignants shall work for us.  They shall toil in our
tobacco fields, their women shall be our handmaidens, we will drink
their wines, and wear their rich clothing, and our pockets shall be
filled with their gold and silver—""

""Silence!"" cried Landless fiercely.  ""Once more I tell you, mad dreamers
that you are, that there shall be no such devil’s work!  Major Havisham,
there are not among us many of this ilk.  Two thirds of our number are
men of the stamp of Robert Godwyn and yourself.  These men rave.""

""I heed them not,"" said Havisham with a slighting gesture of the hand;
then, ""Let us recapitulate. Upon this appointed day we whom they call
Oliverians, and the great majority of the redemptioners, are to rise
throughout the colony.  We—""

""Are to do no damage to property nor offer any unnecessary violence to
masters and overseers,"" said Landless firmly.

""We are simply to arm ourselves, seize horses or boats, and resort to
this appointed place.""

""Yes.""

""Calling upon the slaves to follow us?""

""Which they will do.  Yes.""

""And when all are assembled, to oppose any force sent against us?""

""Yes.""

""And if we conquer, then—""

""Then the Republic,—Commonwealth,—anything you choose—at any rate,
freedom.""

""It is a desperate plan.""

""We are desperate men.""

""Yes,"" Havisham said thoughtfully: ""it is the best chance for that
escape of which we all dream, and which two of our number, I see, have
attempted in vain.  I had set to-morrow night for my own attempt. This
promises better.""

""Yea,"" said Porringer, ""the stars in their courses fight against the
refugee!  Four times have I tried, to be retaken, and handled, as you
see.  Twice has this man tried and failed.  And the murderer of Robert
Godwyn failed.""

""That remains to be seen,"" said Trail.  ""Roach has broken gaol.""

The Muggletonian exclaimed, and Landless turned upon the forger.  ""How
do you know?"" he asked sternly.

""I heard,"" was the smooth reply.

""I am sorry for it,"" said Landless grimly, and stood with a sternly
thoughtful countenance.

There was a silence in the tobacco house broken by Havisham.

""And now—for time passes and the overseer may come and find us not at
our tasks—tell me the day upon which we are to rise, and the place to
which all are to resort.""

""Both are close at hand,"" said Landless slowly. ""The day is—"" he broke
off and leaned forward, staring through the dusk.

""What is it?"" cried Havisham.

""My eyes met other eyes.  There, behind that great crack between the
logs!""

The Muggletonian rushed to the door, flung it open, and vanished; the
branded man followed.  The remaining occupants of the tobacco house
started to their feet, and Havisham picked from the floor a pole and
broke from it a stout cudgel.  Godfrey Landless strode forward into the
broad shaft of sunshine that entered through the opened door and met the
eavesdropper face to face, as, with either arm in the rude grasp of the
fanatics, she crossed the threshold.

The conspirators, recognizing the lady of the manor, were stricken dumb.
In the three minutes of dead silence which ensued they saw their plans
defeated, their hopes ruined, their cause vanquished, their lives lost.
The graceful figure with white scorn in the beautiful face was death
come upon them.  The shadow fell heavy and cold upon their souls, the
very air seemed to darken and grow chill around them.

The figure of the woman in their midst gathered up the sunshine, became
ethereal, transplendent, a triumphant white and gold Spirit of Evil.

Landless was the first to speak.  ""Unhand her!"" he said in a suppressed
voice.

The men obeyed, but the Muggletonian placed himself between his prisoner
and the door.  She saw the movement and said scornfully, ""You need not
fear; I shall not run away.""  Upon her bare, white arms, where they had
been clasped too rudely, were fast darkening marks.  She glanced from
them to the scarred face of the Muggletonian.  ""_They_ will wear out,""
she said.

""Madam,"" said Landless hoarsely, ""how long were you in that place?""

She flashed upon him a look that was like a blow. ""Liar!  be silent!""
she said, then turned to the row of faces that frowned upon her from out
the shadow. ""To you others I address myself.  Traitors, rebellious
servants, base plotters!  I hold your lives in my hand.""

""And your own?"" said Trail.

""Cursed daughter of the mother of evil!"" cried the Muggletonian, a
baleful light burning in his eyes. ""Scarlet woman, whose vain apparel,
whose uncovered hair and bared bosom, whose light songs and laughter
have long been an offense and a stumbling-block to the righteous—thy cup
of iniquity is full, thy life is forfeit, thy hour is come!""  He drew a
knife from his bosom and with an unearthly cry flourished it above his
head, then rushed upon her, to be met by Landless, who hurled himself
upon the would-be murderer with a force that sent them both staggering
against the wall.  A struggle ensued, which ended in Landless securing
the knife.  With it in his hand he sprang to the side of the girl, who
stood unflinching, a pride that was superb in her still white face and
steadfast eyes.

""Who touches her dies,"" he said between his teeth.

Havisham came to his aid.  ""Men, are you mad? You cannot murder a
defenseless woman!  Moreover such a deed would prove our utter ruin.""

""If her body were found, yes!"" cried the hectic youth.  ""But the water
is near, and who is to know that the devil sent her hither?""

""It is her death or ours,"" cried the branded man.

The Muggletonian tossed his arms into the air.

""The cause! the cause!  Cursed be he that putteth his hand to the plough
and finisheth not the furrow!  Ride on!  Ride on! though it were over
the bodies of a thousand painted Jezebels such as this!""

""Time presses!"" cried the branded man.  ""Woodson may come!""

They closed in upon the three who stood at bay. In their dark faces were
a passion and an exaltation—they saw in the woman fallen into their
hands, a sacrifice bound to the altar.  Trail alone looked uneasy and
held back, muttering between his teeth.

Landless stepped in front of Patricia and faced them with a still and
deadly eye, and with the hand that held the knife drawn back against his
breast, Knowing them, he saw no use in any appeal; also he saw that it
was indeed her life or theirs.  On the one hand, the downfall of all
their hopes, the death or perpetual enslavement of many, and for himself
surely the gibbet and the rope; on the other—

He made a gesture of command.  ""Thou shalt do no murder!"" he cried.

""It is not murder; it is sacrifice.""

""There must be another way!"" cried Havisham.

""Find it!""

Havisham turned to the prisoner.  ""Madam, will you swear to be silent
concerning what you have heard?""

The Muggletonian laughed wildly.  ""Who trusts a woman’s oath!""

""You shall have no need,"" said the lady of the manor calmly.  She paused
and her eyes went to the door in an intent and listening gaze, then came
back to the faces about her with a strange light in their depths.
""Rebel servants,"" she said in a clear, low voice, ""I defy you!  And you,
false slave, stand from before me.  I need not your hateful aid.""  In
the moment of ominous silence that followed, she swayed towards the
door, her hand at her throat, her soul in her eyes.  Suddenly she cried
out, ""My father! Charles!  help!""

From without came an answering cry, followed by a rush of men through
the door, and in an instant the room was filled with struggling forms as
the two parties threw themselves upon each other.  The newcomers were
half a dozen blacks, the two overseers and Sir Charles Carew.  The
overseers had pistols and Sir Charles his sword.  With it he met the
rush of the youth with the hectic cheek, who came towards him in long,
hound-like leaps, brandishing a piece of wood above his head, and drove
the blade deep into the chest of the fanatic.  The wretched man
staggered and fell, then rose to his knees.  Flinging his arms above his
head, he turned his worn face towards the flood of sunshine pouring in
through the door, and cried in a loud voice, ""I see!""  A stream of blood
gushed from his lips, his arms dropped, and without a groan he fell
back, dead.

Landless, wrestling with the slave Regulus, at length succeeded in
hurling the powerful figure to the ground, where it lay stunned, and
turned to find himself confronted by Woodson’s pistol and the point of
Sir Charles’s rapier.  A glance showed him the remaining conspirators,
overpowered, and in the act of being bound with the ropes that had lain,
coiled for use in packing, in the corners of the tobacco house.  The
hectic youth lay, a ghastly spectacle, in a pool of blood across the
doorway.  At his feet was the branded man, a bullet through his brain,
and near him the groaning figure of Havisham’s mortally wounded
companion.  The woman who had brought all this to pass stood unharmed,
white, with tragic, exultant eyes.

Sir Charles, serene and debonair, lowered his point. ""Your hand is
played,"" he said with a fine smile. Landless’s stern, despairing gaze
passed him and went on to the overseer.  ""I surrender to you,"" he said
briefly.

Woodson chuckled grimly and stuck his pistol in his belt.  He was in
high good humor, visions of reward and thanks from the Assembly dancing
before his eyes.  ""I ’ve had my eye on you for some time, young man,"" he
said almost genially.  ""I ’ve suspected that you were up to something,
but Lord!  to think that a woman’s wit should have trapped you at last!
Haines, bring that rope over here.""

Sir Charles went over to Patricia and offered her his arm.  ""Dearest and
bravest of women!"" he said in a caressing whisper.  ""Come with me from
this place, which must be dreadful to you.""

She did not answer him at once, but stood looking past him at the
picture of laughing water and waving forest framed in the doorway.

""I thought I should never see the sunshine again,"" she said dreamily.
""Did Margery give _you_ the message?""

""Yes, she met me under the mulberries.  I would not wait to rouse your
father, but calling the overseers and the blacks from the fields, came
at once.""

""I owe you my life,"" she said.  ""You and—""

Her eyes left the summer outside and came back to the shadowy forms
within the tobacco house.  ""I will go with you directly, cousin,"" she
said quietly, ""but first I wish to speak to that man.""

He shot a swift glance at her face, but drew back with a bow, and she
walked with a steady step up to Landless.  ""Fall back a little,"" she
said with an imperious wave of her hand to the men about him. They
obeyed her.  Landless, left standing before her, his arms bound to his
sides, raised his head and looked her in the face.  She met his eyes.
""You lied to me,"" she said in a low, even voice.

""Once, madam, and to save others,"" he said proudly.

""Not once, but twice.  Do you think that now I believe that tale you
told me that night, that fairy tale of persecuted innocence?  When I
think that I ever believed it I hate myself.""

""Nevertheless, it is true, madam.""

""It is false!  Yesterday I thought of you as a gallant gentleman,
greatly wronged ...  and I pitied you.  To-day I am wiser.""

He held her eyes with his own for a moment, then let them go.  ""Some day
you will know,"" he said.

She turned from him and held out her hands to Sir Charles.  He hurried
to her and she clung to him. ""Take me away,"" she said in a whisper.
""Take me home.""

He put his arm about her.  ""You are faint,"" he said tenderly.  ""Come!
the air will revive you.""

Supporting her on his arm, he guided her from the house.  As they passed
the body stretched across the threshold, the skirt of her robe touched
the blood in which it was lying.  She saw it and shuddered.

""Blood is upon me!"" she said.  ""It is an omen!""

""A good one, then,"" said her companion coolly, ""for it is the blood of a
fanatic traitor.  Think not of it.""  He turned at the threshold and cast
a careless glance back into the tobacco house.  ""Woodson, get rid of
this carrion, and bring these men quietly to the great house, where your
master will deal with them.""




                            *CHAPTER XXIII*

                             *THE QUESTION*


""We know all but two things, but those are the most important of all,""
said the Governor, tapping his jeweled fingers against the table.

""It is much to be regretted,"" said the Surveyor-General, ""that the
presence of the young lady was so soon discovered.  Otherwise—""

""Otherwise we might have had further information on more than one
subject,"" said the Governor dryly.

""We must make the best of what we have,"" continued Carrington calmly.
""After all, it is enough.""

The Governor rose and began to pace the floor, his head thoughtfully
bent, his unwounded hand tugging at the curls of his periwig.  ""It is
not enough,"" he said at length, pausing before the great table around
which the company were seated.  ""Thanks to the gallant daughter of the
gallant Verneys,""—a bow and smile to Patricia, sitting enthroned in the
great chair in their midst,—""we know much, but it is not enough. These
rogues have set a day upon which to rise; they have appointed a place to
which they are to resort. That day may be to-morrow, that place any
point in any one of a dozen counties.""

""I apprehend that the cockatrice was to be hatched near by,"" said Sir
Charles.

""It is the likeliest thing,"" answered the Governor, ""seeing that their
ringleader belongs to this plantation.  But we do not know.  And there
may not be time to reach the planters, to give them warning, to arrest
these d—d traitors, scattered as they are from the James to
Rappahannock, and from Henricus to the Chesapeake.  It might be best to
assemble the trainbands at this cursed spot if it can be found, and to
await their coming in force.  But to know neither time nor place—to
start a hue and cry and have the storm burst before it reaches ten
plantations—to guard one point and see fire rise at another a dozen
leagues away—impossible!  Gentlemen, we must come at the heart of this
matter!""

""It is most advisable,"" said Colonel Verney gravely.  ""Examine the
prisoners again,"" suggested Sir Charles.

""One of them is no wiser than we.  You are certain as to this, Mistress
Patricia?""

""Yes, your Excellency.""

""Humph! one does not know; three are dead, there remain, then, that
shaven and branded runaway and the two convicts.""

""You will learn naught from the runaway, your Excellency!"" called out
the overseer from where he stood at a respectful distance from the
company. ""He ’s one of them crazy fanatics that wild horses could n’t
draw truth from.  No Indian torture stake could make him speak if he did
n’t want to,—nor keep him from it if he did.""

""I know that kind,"" said the Governor, with a short laugh, ""and we will
not waste time upon him, but will try if the convict—he who seems to
have been their leader—be not more amenable.  Bring him in, Woodson.""

When the overseer had gone, a silence fell upon the company gathered in
the master’s room.  The Governor paced to and fro, perplexity in his
face; the Colonel knit his grizzled brows and studied the floor; Dr.
Anthony Nash brought the writing materials displayed upon the table,
closer to him, and held a quill ready poised for dipping into the ink
horn, while the Surveyor-General with a carefully composed countenance
toyed with a pink which he took from the bowl of flowers before him.
Sir Charles leaned back in his seat and looked at Patricia who, seated
between him and her father, stared before her with hard, bright eyes.
Her lips were like a scarlet flower against the absolute pallor of her
face; her hair was a crown of pale gold.  In the great chair, her white
arms resting upon the dark wood, her feet upon a carved footstool, she
looked a queen, and the knot of brilliantly dressed gentlemen her
attendant council.

The door opened and the two overseers appeared with Landless, who
advanced and stood, silent and collected, before the ring of hostile
faces.

""What is your name, sirrah?"" said the Governor, throwing himself into
his chair and frowning heavily.

""Godfrey Landless.""

""I am told that you are son to one Warham Landless, a so-called colonel
in the rebel army and hand in glove with the usurper himself.""

""I am the son of Colonel Warham Landless of the forces of the
Commonwealth, and friend to his Highness the Lord Protector.""

""Humph!  And did you fight in these same forces yourself?""

""At Worcester, yes.""

""Humph! the son of a traitor and rebel—traitor and rebel yourself—and
convict to boot!  A pretty record!  On what day was this rising to
occur?""

No answer.  The Governor repeated the question. ""On what day was this
precious mine to be sprung? And to what place were you to resort?""

Landless remaining silent, the Governor’s face began to flush and the
veins in his forehead to swell. ""Have you lost your tongue?"" he said
fiercely.  ""If so, we will find a way to recover it.""

""I shall not answer those questions,"" said Landless firmly.

""It is your one chance for life,"" said the Governor sternly.  ""Answer me
truly, and you may escape the gallows.  Refuse, and you hang, so surely
as I sit here.""

""I shall not answer them.""

""Sink me if I ever knew a Roundhead so careless of his own interests,""
drawled Sir Charles.  The Governor whispered to the master of the
plantation, then turned again to the prisoner.

""I give you one more chance,"" he said harshly. ""When is this day?  Where
is this place?""

""I shall not tell you.""

""We will see about that,"" said his Excellency with compressed lips.
""Verney, send your daughter from the room.  Woodson, you understand this
gear, having been in the Indies.  This man is to tell us all that he
knows of this business.  Call in a trustworthy slave or two to help
you.""

Patricia uttered a low cry, and the Surveyor-General crushed the flower
between his fingers and turned upon the Governor.  ""Your Excellency!  I
protest! This that you would do is not lawful!  Surely such harsh
measures are not needed.""

The Governor’s fury exploded.  ""Not needful!"" he exclaimed in a high
voice.  ""Not needful, when upon these questions hang the fortunes of the
Colony! when if we fail, to-morrow may usher in a blacker forty-four!
And not lawful!  I am the law in this State, Major Carrington; I am the
King’s representative, and this is my prerogative! and I say that by
fair means or foul this information must be gained. This is no time to
prate of humanity.  We are to show humanity to ourselves; we are to
stamp out this lit fuse.  Or does Major Carrington wish it to burn on?""

""No,"" said Carrington coldly.  ""I spoke hastily. You are right, of
course, and I will interfere no further.""

An hour later Patricia stood before the hall window looking out upon the
dazzling water and the green velvet of the marshes with wide, unseeing
eyes.  Her hands were clenched at her sides and upon each cheek burned a
crimson spot.  Beside her crouched Betty Carrington who, upon the first
rumor of trouble at Verney Manor, had ridden over from Rosemead. Their
strained ears caught no sound from the room opposite other than the
occasional sound of the Governor’s voice, raised in interrogation.
There came no answering voice.  Patricia stood motionless, with eyes
that never wandered from the rich scene without, and with lips pressed
together, but Betty hid her face in the other’s skirts and shivered.
The door of the master’s room opened and both started violently.  The
overseer strode down the hall and had laid his hand upon the latch of
the door leading to the offices, when his mistress called him to her.
""Do they know? Has the man told?"" she asked with an effort.

Woodson shook his head.  ""He ’s as dumb as an oyster.  Might as well try
to get anything from an Indian.  They ’re going to try t’ other—Trail.""

He left the hall, but was back in five minutes’ time with the forger.
They entered the master’s room, and Patricia, seized by a sudden
impulse, followed them, leaving Betty trembling in the window scat.

Unnoted by all but one of the company, she slipt to a seat in the shadow
of her father’s burly shoulders. He was leaning forward, talking to the
Governor, who sat very erect, his features fixed in an expression of
dogged determination.  The Surveyor-General sat well behind the table,
and upon the polished wood before him lay a little heap of torn petals
and broken stems. At the far end of the room and leaning heavily against
the wall was the prisoner whose examination was just finished.

Sir Charles had seen the entrance of the lady of the manor, and he now
rose from his seat and came to her.  ""Not a syllable,"" he whispered in
answer to the question in her eyes.  ""Roundhead obstinacy! But I think
that this fellow will prove more malleable.""

His prediction was verified.  Ten minutes later the Governor rose to his
feet triumphant.  ""So!"" he said, drawing a long breath.  ""We are, I
think, gentlemen, at the very core at last.  The time, day after
to-morrow; the place, Poplar Spring in this county. And now to work!
Those of these d—d Oliverians whom we can reach must be arrested at
once.  Swift messengers must be sent to all plantations far and near.
The trainbands must be called out.  Time presses, gentlemen!""

""And these men?"" said the Colonel.

""Must go to Jamestown gaol, where the one shall hang as surely as my
name is William Berkeley.  For the other—""

""Your Excellency has promised me my life,"" said Trail cringingly, but
with an inscrutable something that was not fear in his sinister green
eyes.

""An escort must be gotten together,"" said the Colonel, ""and the day is
far advanced.  I advise keeping them here until the morning.""

""See that you keep them straitly then,"" said the Governor.

""Trust me for that, your Excellency,"" said the overseer grimly.

""Then to work, gentlemen,"" cried the Governor, ""for there is much to do
and but little time to do it in.  Major Carrington, you with Mr. Peyton
will ride with me to Jamestown.  Colonel Verney, you will know what
measures to take for the safety of your shire.  Woodson, have the horses
brought around at once.""

The Council broke up in haste and confusion, and its members, talking
eagerly, streamed into the hall. Carrington was the last in line, and he
paused before Landless.  The under overseer and the slave Regulus were
at a little distance replacing the cords about Trail’s arms.  The
Surveyor-General cast a quick glance towards the door, saw that the last
retreating figure was that of Mr. Peyton, and approached his lips close
to Landless’s ear.

""You are a brave man,"" he said in a low and troubled voice.  ""From my
soul I honor you!  I would have saved you, would save you now if I
could. But I am cruelly placed.""

""I have no hope for this life—and no fear,"" said Landless calmly.

Carrington paused irresolute, and a flush rose to his face.  ""I would
like to hear you say that you do not blame me,"" he said at last with an
effort.

""I do not blame you,"" said Landless.

Woodson appeared in the doorway.  ""The Governor is waiting, Major
Carrington.""

""If I can do ought to help you, I will,"" said Carrington hastily, and
left the room.  A moment later came the jingling of reins and the sound
of rapid hoofs quickening into the planter’s pace as the Governor and
the Surveyor-General whirled away.




                             *CHAPTER XXIV*

                              *A MESSAGE*


In an unused attic room of the great house lay Godfrey Landless, cords
about his ankles, and his arms bound to his sides by cords and by a
thick rope, one end of which was fastened to a beam on the wall. He was
alone, for the Muggletonian, Havisham and Trail were confined in the
overseer’s house. Opposite him was a small window framing a square of
sky. He had watched light clouds drift across it, and the sun pass
slowly and majestically down it, and the sunset turn the clouds into
floating blood-red plumes. He had been there since noon.  Thick walls
kept from him all sound in the house below—it might have been a house of
the dead.  Through the closed window came the low, incessant hum of the
summer world without, but no unusual noise.  He had heard the sunset
horn, and the song of the slaves coming from the fields, and as dusk
began to fall, the cry of a whip-poor-will.

When the door had closed upon the retreating figures of the men who
brought him there, he had thrown himself upon the floor where he lay,
faint from physical anguish, in a stupor of misery, conscious only of a
sick longing for death.  This mood had passed and he was himself again.

As he lay with his eyes following the fiery, shifting feathers of cloud,
he remembered that the gaol at Jamestown faced the south, and he
thought, ""This is the last sunset I shall ever see.""  He had the strong
abiding faith of his time and party, and he looked beyond the clouds
with an awe and a light in his eyes. Verses learnt at his mother’s knee
came back to him; he said them over to himself, and the tender, solemn,
beneficent words fell like balm upon his troubled heart.  He thought of
his mother who had died young, and then of scenes and occurrences of his
childhood. All earthly hope was past, there could be no more struggling;
in a little while he would be dead. Dying, his mind reverted, not to the
sordid misery from which death would set him free, but to the long past,
to the child at the mother’s knee, to the boy who had climbed down great
cliffs in search of a smuggler’s cave.  The unearthly light that rests
upon that time so far behind us shone strong for him—he saw every twig
in the rooks’ nests in the lofty elms, every ivy leaf about a ruined
oriel, black against a gold sky; the cool, dark smell of the box alleys
filled his nostrils: the sound of the sea came to him; he heard his
mother singing on the terrace.  He bowed his face with a sudden rain of
tender, not sorrowful, tears.

Something crashed in at the window, splintering the coarse glass and
falling upon the floor at a little distance from him.  It was a large
pebble, to which was tied a piece of paper.  He started up and made for
it, to be brought up within two feet of it by the tug of the rope which
bound him to the wall.  He thought a moment, then lay down upon the
floor and found that he could touch the end of the string that tied the
paper to the pebble.  He took it between his teeth and slowly drew it
towards him, then, rising to his knees, he strained with all his might
at the cords that bound his arms.  They were tightly drawn, but when at
length he desisted, panting, he had so loosened them that he could move
one hand a very little way.  With it and with his teeth he disengaged
the paper from the pebble and spread it upon his knee.  There was just
light enough to read the sprawling schoolboy hand with which it was
covered. It ran thus:—

""I don’t know as this will ever reach you.  I am doing all I can.  Luiz
Sebastian has not let me get at arm’s length from him since I overheard
him and the Turk, and a sailor from Captain Laramore’s ship and _Roach_
at the hut on the marsh, two hours ago.  They would have killed me
there, but I ran, and he did not catch me until I was almost to the
quarters.  He will kill me though in a little while, I know; he has a
knife and he is sitting on the door-step, and the Turk is with him, and
I can not pass them.  He held his hand over my mouth and the knife to my
heart when Woodson went the rounds, and I could n’t make no sound—Lord
have mercy upon me!  I write this with my blood, on a leaf from your
Bible, while he sits there whispering to the Turk.  He goes to his own
cabin directly and he will take me with him and kill me there, I know he
will.  He goes to the stables first and I must go with him.  If we pass
close enough, and if I can do it without his seeing me I will throw this
in at the window of the room where I know you are, if not—the Lord help
us all! ... Landless, for God’s sake! before moonrise to-night the
Chickahominies and the Ricahecrians from the Blue Mountains will come
down on the plantation. With them are leagued Luiz Sebastian, the Turk,
Trail, Roach, and most of the slaves....  When all is over, the Indians
will take the scalps and Grey Wolf and will make for the Blue Mountains;
Luiz Sebastian and the others will seize the boats and put off for the
ship at the Point.  Her crew will give her up and they will all turn
pirate together.  The women go with them if they can keep them from the
Indians; the men are all to be killed....  I have told you all I heard.
For God’s sake, save them if you can,—and remember poor Dick
Whittington.""

Dropping the paper, Landless strained with all his might, first at the
cords which bound his arms, and then at the rope which fastened him to
the wall. Again and again he put forth the strength of despair—his
muscles cracked, great beads stood upon his forehead—but the ropes held.
As well as he could with his shackled feet he stamped upon the floor; he
called aloud, but there came no answering voice or sound from below.  He
was at the end of the house over unused chambers, and the walls and
flooring were very thick.  He clenched his teeth and began again the
battle with the cords which held him.  All in vain.  He shouted until he
was hoarse—it was crying aloud in a desert.  With a groan he leaned
against the wall, gathering strength for another effort. It was dark now
and the moon rose at eleven.... There was a piece of glass upon the
floor, one of the splinters from the shattered window.  He remembered
noticing it—a long narrow piece like the blade of a knife.  Sinking to
his knees he felt for it, and after a long time found it.  He now had a
knife, but he could not move the hand that held it six inches from his
side.  Stooping, he took the splinter between his teeth, and making the
rope taut, drew the sharp edge of the glass across it.  Again and again
he drew it across, and at length he perceived that a strand was severed.
With a thrill of joy he settled to the slow, laborious and painful task.
Time passed, a long, long time, and yet the rope was but half severed.
As he worked he counted the moments with feverish dread, his heart
throbbed one passionate prayer: ""Lord, let me save her!""  Now and then
he glanced at the blackness of the night outside with a terrible
fear—though he knew it could not be yet—that he should see it waver into
moonlight.  Another interval of toil, and he stood erect, gathered his
forces, made one supreme effort—and was free!  There was not time for
the cords about his arms, but he must get rid of those which fettered
his ankles.  An endless task it seemed, but hand and friendly splinter
accomplished it at last: and he sprang to the door.  It was locked.  He
dashed himself against it, once, twice, thrice, and it crashed outwards,
precipitating him into a large, bare room.  He crossed this, managed to
open its unlocked door with his free hand, descended a winding stair and
came into the upper hall.  It was in darkness, but up the wide staircase
streamed the perfumed light of many myrtle candles, and with it
laughter, and the sound of a man’s voice singing to a lute.




                             *CHAPTER XXV*

                         *THE ROAD TO PARADISE*


The family and guests of Verney Manor were assembled in the great room.
The day had been one of confusion, haste and anxiety; but it was past,
and the stillness and forced inaction of the night was upon them.  With
the readiness of those to whom danger is no novelty they seized the hour
and made the most of it.  Sufficient unto the morrow was the evil
thereof.

The Colonel, weary from hard riding, but well satisfied with his
afternoon’s work, had sunk into a great chair and challenged Dr. Anthony
Nash to a game of chess.  ""Everything is in train,"" he told them, ""and
all quiet upon the plantations in this shire at least.  I believe the
danger past.  God be thanked!""  Upon a settle piled with cushions lay
Captain Laramore, with a bandaged shoulder, a long pipe between his
teeth, and at his elbow a tankard of sack and an elderly Hebe in the
person of Mistress Lettice Verney. Patricia, sumptuously clad and
beautiful as a dream, sat in the great window with Betty and Sir
Charles. Her eyes shone with a feverish brilliancy, her white hands were
never still, she laughed and jested with her lover, touching this or
that with light wit.  Once or twice she broke into song, rich,
passionate, throbbing through the night.  The gentle Betty looked at her
in wonder, but Sir Charles was enchanted.

Steps sounded on the stairs and in the hall.  ""Who is that?"" cried the
master, taking his hand from his rook.

""The overseer, probably,"" said Dr. Nash.  ""Check to your king.""

A loud scream from Mistress Lettice.  The master leaped to his feet,
knocking over the chess-table and sending the pieces rattling into
corners.  Sir Charles, drawing his rapier, sprang to his side, the
wounded Captain started up from amidst his pillows and the divine
snatched a brass andiron from the fireplace.

Framed in the doorway, looking larger than life against the blackness of
the space behind him, stood the arch plotter, the Roundhead, the
convict, the rebellious servant whom the Governor had sworn to hang.
Blood dropped from his face, cut by the glass with which he had severed
the rope, to meet the blood upon his arms and chest, lacerated by his
savage straining at his bonds.  For a moment he stood, blinded by the
light, then advanced into the room. His master seized him.  ""Still
bound!"" he cried with an oath.  ""He is alone then!  How did you get
here?  What are you doing here’?  Speak, scoundrel!""

""I bring you this paper, sir,"" said Landless hoarsely.  ""Will you take
it from me.  I cannot raise my hands.""

The Colonel snatched the paper, glanced at it, read it with a face from
which all the ruddy color had fled, and held it out to Sir Charles with
a shaking hand. ""Read it,"" he gasped.  ""Read it aloud,"" and sank into
his chair breathing heavily.

Sir Charles read.  ""Damnation!"" he cried, crushing the paper in his
hand.  Laramore started up with a roar of ""My ship!"" and then broke into
a torrent of oaths.  Mistress Lettice’s screams filled the room until
her brother roughly silenced her by clapping his hand over her mouth.
""By the Lord Harry, Lettice, I will throw you out to them if you do not
hush!  Gentlemen, in God’s name, what are we to do?""

""Barricade door and window and hold the house against them,"" said the
baronet.

""Send for help to Rosemead and to Fitzhugh and Ludwell!"" cried the
divine.

""Five men and three women to hold this house against a hundred Indians
and negroes!  And no help could come for hours and it is now nearly ten!
Moreover, the messenger would have to pass through the savages lying in
the woods,—he would never reach Rosemead with his scalp on!""

""I will be your messenger,"" said Nash rising, ""and as every moment is
more precious than rubies, I had best start at once.""

""You, Anthony!  God forbid!"" cried the Colonel. ""You would go to certain
death.""

""I would stay to certain death, would I not?"" retorted the other.  ""But
my mare, Pixie, and I can shew clean heels to the red villains, were
they as thick as chinquepins.  Give me the stable-key, Verney.  I know
the way to the jade’s stall, and she will follow her master through fire
and water without a whinny. I don’t want a light.  Not a soul on the
place must know that I have left Verney Manor.""

""Anthony, Anthony, I am loth to see you go, old friend!"" cried the
Colonel.

""Tut, tut, as well leave my scalp in the woods as in Dick Verney’s
parlor! but I shall do neither. Hold the house as long as you can, and
look for Carrington, and Fitzhugh, and Ludwell, and myself with a
hundred men at our heels before the dawn.  Until then _vale_.""

He was gone.  ""And now the doors and windows,"" said Sir Charles.

""The windows, save those in this room, are secured as they always are at
night.  The shutters are heavy and strongly barred, and we have but to
draw the chains across the doors.  They will find it hard work to fire
the house, for the logs are wet from this morning’s shower.  There is
ammunition enough, and the shutters are loopholed.  If we were in force,
we might hold out, but, my God! what can we do?  Even with the overseers
whom we must manage to call to us, if we can do so without arousing
suspicion, we are not enough to defend one face of the house.’

""Are there no honest servants?""

""How can I tell the true men from the knaves? To rouse the quarters
would be to show that we know, and to ourselves spring the mine which is
to destroy us.  And if we brought men into the house, who are leagued
with the fiends outside, then would their work be done for them.  There
are a very few whom I know to be faithful, but how to secure them
without giving the alarm—my God! how helpless we are!""

""Perhaps I can help you, Colonel Verney,"" said Landless.

In the midst of a dead silence the eyes of each occupant of the
room,—the master, the courtier, the wounded captain, the women,
trembling in each other’s arms,—were turned upon the speaker who stood
before them, haggard, torn and bleeding, but with a quiet power in his
dark face and steadfast eyes.

""You?"" said the master sternly.  ""What can you do?""

""I will tell you,"" said Landless, ""but I must be freed from these bonds
first.""

Another pause, and then Sir Charles, responding to a nod from his
kinsman, walked over to Landless, and with his rapier cut the ropes
which bound him.

""Now speak!"" said the Colonel.


The quarters lay, to all appearance, wrapt in the profoundest slumber—no
movement in the low-browed cabins, or in the lane or square; no sound
other than the croak of the frogs in the marshes, the wail of the
whip-poor-wills, and the sighing of the night wind in the pines.  All
was dark save in the east, where the low stars were beginning to pale.
Below them glowed a dull red spark, shining dimly across a long expanse
of black marsh and water, and coming from Captain Laramore’s ship,
anchored off the Point.

One moment it seemed the only light in the wide landscape of darkness;
the next the flame of a torch, streaming sidewise in the wind, cast an
orange glare upon the dead tree in the centre of the square and upon the
windowless fronts of the cabins surrounding it.  The torch was in the
hand of the overseer, who went the rounds, striking upon each door, and
summoning the inmates of the cabin to the square.  ""The master wants a
word with you,"" was all the answer he vouchsafed to startled, sullen, or
suspicious inquiries.  In five minutes the square was thronged. White
and black, servant and slave, rustic, convict, Jew, Turk, Indian,
mulatto, quadroon, coal black, untamed African—the motley crowd pressed
and jostled towards that end of the square at which stood the master,
his kinsman, the overseer, and Godfrey Landless.  Behind them on the
steps of the overseer’s house were the Muggletonian, Havisham, and
Trail. They had been unbound.  In the Muggletonian’s scarred face was
stolid indifference, but Trail looked furtively about until he spied
Luiz Sebastian, when he signaled ""What is it?"" with his eyes.  The
mulatto shook his head, and continued to shoulder his way through the
press until he stood in the front row, face to face with the party from
the great house.  On one side of him was the Turk, on the other an
Indian.

The master stepped a pace or two in front of his companions, and held up
his hand for silence.  When the excited muttering had sunk into a
breathless hush, he beckoned to Landless, and the young man stepped to
his side.  There were many streaming lights by now, and men saw each
other, now clearly, now darkly, as the fitful glare rose and fell.

""Now, my man,"" said the master in a loud, slow voice, ""you will point
out to me, as you have agreed to do, every man concerned in the plot
discovered this morning.  And you whom he designates, I command you, in
the name of the King, to surrender peaceably. Your hope of pardon
depends upon your doing so. Now, Landless!""

""John Havisham,"" said Landless.

""Taken redhanded,"" quoth the master.  ""Place him here, Woodson, in front
of us.  When all are in line, I shall have a word to say to them.""

Havisham advanced with quiet dignity, passing Landless as if unaware of
his presence.  ""I surrender,"" he said, raising his voice, ""because I
have no choice.  And I advise those of our number here present to do the
same.  Our plans known, our friends taken, betrayed and deserted by the
man in whom we trusted most, whom we called our leader, we have, indeed,
no choice.""

""Win-Grace Porringer,"" said Landless.

The Muggletonian threw up his arms.  ""Iscariot!"" he cried wildly.  ""Woe,
woe to him by whom offenses come!  Well for thee, son of Warham
Landless, hadst thou never been born!  By the power given to the Two
Witnesses and to their followers I curse thee! Thou shalt be anathema
maranatha!  Famine, thirst, and a violent death be thy portion in this
life, and in the world to come mayest thou burn forever, howling!  Amen
and amen!""  With a wild laugh he stalked to the side of Havisham,
leaving Trail standing alone upon the doorstep.  The eyes of the forger
met the eyes of Luiz Sebastian in another puzzled inquiry, but the
latter shook his head with a frown. Not doubting that his name would be
the next called, Trail had already taken a step forward, but Landless’s
eyes passed him over, and rested upon the face of a man standing near
Luiz Sebastian.

""John Robert!"" he cried.

The man, a Baptist preacher suffering under the Act of Uniformity,
turned a gentle, reproachful face upon him, and stepping from the crowd,
joined himself to Havisham and the Muggletonian.

""James Holt!"" said Landless.

A rustic, standing behind Luiz Sebastian, uttered a dreadful
imprecation.  ""You may hang me and welcome, your Honor,"" he cried as he
took his place, ""if you ’ll just let me see this d—d Judas hung first!""

Luiz Sebastian fixed his great eyes upon Landless. ""If he calls my
name,"" said the wicked brain behind the blandly smiling face, ""shall I,
or shall I not—? It is many minutes to moonrise yet.""

But Landless did not call him.  He passed him by as he had passed Trail,
and named another rustic at some little distance from the mulatto, then
a Fifth Monarchy man, then a veteran of Cromwell’s, then the plantation
miller and the carpenter, then two more Oliverians, then more peasants.
Each man, as his name was called, stepped forward into the lengthening
line that faced the master and his party, standing with pistols leveled
and cocked; and each man bestowed upon Godfrey Landless a curse, or a
look that was bitterer than a curse.

""Humfrey Elder!"" called Landless.

The old butler shot from out the crowd, as though impelled from a
catapult.  ""Your Honor!"" he screamed, ""the man as says _I_ plot against
a Verney, lies!  I that fought with your Honor at Naseby!  I that you
brought from home with you when Mistress Patricia was a baby, and that
has poured your wine from that day to this!  I plot with these
rapscallions and Roundheads!  Your Honor, he lies in his throat!""

""Fall into line, Humfrey,"" said his master quietly; ""I will hear you out
later, but now, obey me.""

The watchful eyes of Luiz Sebastian were growing very watchful indeed.

""Regulus!"" cried Landless.

Under cover of a burst of protestation from Regulus, the Turk whispered
to the mulatto, ""By Allah! this is the slave you would not approach!
You said he would die for his master.""

""He is not of them,"" returned the other.  ""St. Jago! if I understand it!
But what can it matter? The moon will rise in less than an hour.""

""Dick Whittington!"" cried Landless.

There was a moment’s silence, broken by the mulatto, who had stepped out
of line, and now stood facing the party from the great house.  ""I grieve
to say, señors,"" he said in his silkiest tone, ""that the poor Dick was
but now taken with the fever, and lies in a stupor within his cabin.
To-morrow, perhaps, he will be better, and will answer when you call.""

""That is your cabin, just beyond you there, is it not?"" demanded
Landless.

""Assuredly,"" with a quick glance.  ""And what then?""

Landless raised his voice to a shout.  ""Dick Whittington!""

""Mother of God! what do you mean?"" exclaimed the mulatto.  ""Your voice
cannot reach him, deaf and dumb from the fever, lying in his cabin at
the far end of the lane.""

""Dick Whittington!"" again loudly called Landless.

A cry arose from the crowd behind the mulatto and between him and his
cabin.  The next instant there broke through them the figure, bound and
gagged, of young Dick Whittington.  As he rushed past the mulatto, the
latter, with a snarl of fury, grappled with him, but animated with, the
strength of despair, the boy, bound as he was, broke from him and rushed
to Landless, at whose feet he dropped in a dead faint. Upon the crowd
fell a silence so intense that nature herself seemed to have ceased to
breathe.  Luiz Sebastian, darting glances here, there, and everywhere,
from eyes in which doubt was fast growing into certainty, came upon
something which told its own tale. The women’s cabins were at some
distance from the square, and nearer to the great house, and from the
one to the other was passing a hurried line of women and children with
the under overseer at their head.

With the sight vanished the last remnant of doubt from the mind of the
mulatto....  Landless saw that he saw; saw the intention with which he
slipped out of range of the pistols; saw the wicked light in his face;
saw him beckon to the Indian and point to the forest; saw the glistening
and rolling eyeballs and the working lips of the throng of slaves who
had by imperceptible degrees separated from the whites, and were now
massing together at one side of the square; saw the Turk with a knife in
his hand; saw Trail edging away from the group before the overseer’s
cabin—and sprang forward, his powerful figure instinct with
determination, the set calm of the face with which he had met Havisham’s
quiet disdain and the imprecations of the other conspirators, broken up
into fire and passion, high and resolved.  Blood was upon it still, and
upon his arms and half naked breast; his eyes burned; and as he threw up
his arm in a gesture of command, he looked the very genius of war, and
he seized and held every eye and ear.

""Men!"" he cried, addressing himself to the line he had called into
being.  ""Havisham, Arnold, Allen, Braxton! we fought in the same cause
once, fought for God and the Commonwealth!  To-night we will fight
again, and together; fight for our lives and for the honor of women!
Comrades, I am no traitor!  I have not sold you!  You have cursed me
without cause.  Listen!  Colonel Verney, will you repeat the oath you
swore to me an hour ago?""

The master stepped to his side.  ""I swear,"" he cried, in his loud, manly
voice, ""by the faith of a Christian, by the honor of a gentleman, that
not one of you whose names have been given by this man, shall in any way
suffer by having been privy to this plot. I will so work with the
Governor and Council that your bodies shall not be touched, nor your
time of service increased.  Bygones shall be bygones between us.  This
applies to all save this man, the head and front of the conspiracy.  Him
I cannot save.  He must pay the penalty, but he shall be the scapegoat
for the rest of you.  You have my promise, the promise of a man who
never breaks his word for good or evil.""

""In the woods yonder are Indians,"" cried Landless. ""They wait but for
moonrise, for the appointed hour, to fall upon the plantation.  You
called me traitor! It is Luiz Sebastian and Trail who are the traitors,
the betrayers!  They are leagued with the Indians and with the slaves.
Look at them, and see that I speak truth!""

The look was sufficient.  The dusky mass of slaves had swayed forward
with one low, deep, bestial growl. Crouched for the spring, they were
yet held in leash by the menace of the pistols, leveled upon them and
gleaming in the torchlight, and by the restraining gesture and voice of
Luiz Sebastian.  In the crowd of servants, now quite separated from the
slaves, was noise and confusion, and behind the Turk, standing midway
between the parties, was forming a phalanx of villainous white faces—the
dissolute, the convict, the refuse of the plantation,—and at his side,
suddenly as though sprung from the earth, appeared the evil face and red
hair of the murderer of Robert Godwyn.

The silence of the Oliverians, stricken dumb by this new turn of
affairs, was broken by Havisham’s crying to Landless,—

""What are we to do, friend?""

""Make for the house and defend it and our lives,"" answered Landless,
""but first I call upon all true men among you yonder to leave those
murderers and join yourselves to us.""

""In the name of the King!"" cried the Colonel.

""In the name of God!"" said Landless.

Some seven or eight broke from the opposite throng and with lowered
heads ran to them across the open space.  Landless stooped, and lifting
the senseless figure at his feet swung it over his shoulder.

""We are ready, Colonel Verney.  Steady, men! Follow me!""  He turned to
the great house, rising vast and dark, two hundred yards away.

A gigantic, coal black Ashantee chief broke from the throng opposite
and, uttering his war cry, bounded across the space between them.
Another instant and he would have been upon them, and close after him a
yelling pack of hell hounds—the overseer’s pistol cracked, and the black
giant fell dead.  A yell arose from the crowd, but they stood
irresolute.  For firearms, so strictly kept from servants and slaves, so
pre-eminently pertaining to the dominant class, they had a superstitious
dread.  Four pistols meant four lives picked from the foremost to
advance.

""Let them go,"" cried the mulatto, with a taunting laugh.  ""Let them go!
Let them go cage themselves in wooden walls where we will take them all
together—rats in a trap.  We will wait for the Chickahominies who have
guns, señors, and for the Ricahecrians whose scalping knives are very
bright.  Until moonrise, señors from the great house, and you others who
go with them!  Mother of God! look well upon it, for it is the last you
will ever see!""

Fifteen minutes later saw the house of Verney Manor garrisoned by some
thirty desperate men. They had entered to find a scene of confusion—the
hall and lower rooms filled with frightened women and crying children.
Patricia with white cheeks and brilliant eyes had come forward to meet
her father, carrying a three days’ child in her arms.  Beyond her was
Betty, bending her sweet, pale face over the mother, caught up from her
pallet and carried to the house in the arms of the under overseer.
Mistress Lettice was alternately wailing that they were all undone and
murdered, and wringing her hands over the obstinacy of Captain Laramore
who, rapier in left hand, would stand guard at the door, instead of
keeping quiet as the Doctor had said he must.  The master’s stern
command for silence reduced the clamor of women and children to an
undertone of lamentation. ""We must to work at once,"" he said, ""and
apportion our forces.  There are about thirty men, are there not,
Woodson?  I shall take the front with ten: Charles, thou shalt have one
side, Woodson the other, and Haines the back.  Laramore, thou must let
us fight for thee, man, though I know thou findest it a bitter pill.  Do
you marshal the men, Woodson, and divide them into four parties, one for
each face, and tell the women to leave off their whimpering and prepare
to load the muskets.  Haines, have the arms taken down from the racks
and distribute them.  Men and women, one and all, you are to remember
that you are fighting for your lives and for more than your lives.  You
know what you have to expect if you are taken.""

Sir Charles, followed by Landless, the Muggletonian and some three or
four others, entered the great room, which, with the master’s room,
occupied that side of the house allotted to the baronet.  The wax
candles still burned upon the spinet, and upon the high mantel, and in
the middle of the floor lay the overturned chess table.  Three of the
four windows were closely shuttered, but the fourth was open, and before
it stood a graceful figure, looking out into the darkness.

Sir Charles strode hurriedly over to it.  ""Cousin! this is madness!  You
know not to what danger you may be exposing yourself.  Come away!""

""I am watching for the moonrise,"" she said dreamily.  ""It is very near
now.  Look at the white glow above the water, and how pale the stars
are! How beautiful it is, and how cool the wind upon your forehead!
Listen! that was the cry of a jay, surely! and yet why should we hear it
at night?""

""It is the cry of a jay, sure enough,"" said the overseer, pausing in his
hurried passage through the room, ""but it was made by Indian lips.""

""Come away, for God’s sake!"" cried the baronet.

""Look! there is the moon!"" she answered.

Above the level of marsh and water appeared a thin line of silver.  It
thickened, rounded, became a glorious orb.  The marshes blanched from
black to gray, and across the water, from the dim land to the great
silver globe, stretched a long, bright, shimmering path.

A knot of women appeared in the doorway, laden with powder-flasks and
platters filled with bullets. One, with only a stick wound with faded
flowers in her hand, left them and glided to the open window.

""Margery!"" said Patricia softly.

The mad woman, pressing in front of her mistress, looked out into the
night and saw the white shining road cutting through the darkness and
stretching endlessly away.  She threw up her arms with a cry of rapture.

""The road to Paradise! the road to Paradise!""

An arrow whistled through the window and struck into her bosom—into her
heart—the staff dropped from her hand, and she swayed forward and fell
at her mistress’s feet.

The night, so placid, still and beautiful, was rent and in an instant
made hideous by a sound so long, loud, and dreadful, that it might have
been the shriek of a legion of exultant fiends.  It rose to the stars,
sunk to the earth and rose again, unearthly, menacing, curdling the
blood and turning the heart to stone.

""The war-whoop,"" said Woodson.  ""Close the window, quick.""




                             *CHAPTER XXVI*

                                *NIGHT*


That terrible cadence preluded pandemonium, the hush of horror that
followed it being broken by one deep and awful roar of voices as the
insurgents, red, white, and black, joined forces and swept down upon the
devoted house.

""They will try the front first,"" quoth the master from his loophole.
""Steady, men, until I give the word!  Now, let them have it with a
wannion!""

The muskets cracked and a louder yell arose from without.

""Two,"" said the master composedly, receiving a fresh musket from his
daughter’s hand.

""They will try to dash in the door, your Honor!"" cried the overseer from
his post of observation. ""They have the trunk of a pine with them.""

""Let them come,"" said his master grimly.  ""They will find a warm
welcome.""

A double line of savages raised the great trunk from the ground and
advanced with it at a run, yelling as they came.  They had reached the
steps leading up into the porch when from the loopholed door and window
within there poured a deadly fire.  Three fell, but the battering-ram
came on and struck against the door with tremendous force.  The door
held, and but twelve of the twenty who had entered the porch returned to
their fellows.

""They won’t try that again,"" said the master with a short laugh.

""They are dividing,"" cried the overseer.  ""They will surround the house.
Every man to his post!""

Around the corner of the house to the moonlit sward beneath the great
room windows swept a tide of Indians and negroes with Luiz Sebastian and
the two Ricahecrian brothers at their head.  A few of the Indians had
guns; the slaves were armed with axes, scythes, knives—the plunder of
the tool house—or with jagged pieces of old iron, or with oars taken
from the boats and broken into dreadful clubs.  They came on with a din
that was terrific, the savages from the eastern hemisphere howling like
the beasts within their native forests, those from the western uttering
at intervals their sterner, more appalling cry.

Within the great room Sir Charles, languidly graceful as ever, stood
beside the small square opening in the door that led down into the
garden, and fired again and again into the mob without.  He fought with
an air as became the fine gentleman of the period, but underneath the
elaborate carelessness of demeanor was a cool precision of action.  The
hand that so nonchalantly brushed away the grains of powder from his
white ruffles, was steady enough at the trigger; the eye that turned
from the red death without to cast languishing glances at his mistress
where she stood directing the women, was quick to note the minutest
change in savage tactics.  He jested as he fought—once he drew a
tremulous wail of laughter from Mistress Lettice’s lips.

A bullet sung through the aperture and grazed his arm.  ""The first
blood,"" he said, with a laugh.

""There’s a man killed in the master’s room and two in the hall!"" cried
young Whittington, from his post at the far window.

""And Margery,"" said Patricia, coming forward with the kerchief from her
neck in her hand.  ""Let me bind up your wound, cousin.""

He held out his arm with a smile and a few low, caressing words, and she
wound the lawn that was not whiter than her face about it; then moved
back to where the women worked, loading and passing the muskets to the
men who kept up an incessant fire upon the assailants.

The whole house filled with smoke through which the figures of the
besieged loomed large and indistinct, and the noise—the crack of the
muskets, the loud commands and oaths, the scream of a frightened woman
or child, the groans of the wounded, of whom there were now many—became
deafening.  The attack was now general, and the men on each face had
their hands full.  Without was horrible clamor, oaths, shots, yells,
crashing blows against door and window; within was noise and confusion,
and fear, stern and controlled, but blanching the lip of the men and
showing in the agony of the women’s eyes.

Sir Charles, turning for a fresh musket, after a highly successful shot
as the yell outside had testified, found Patricia at his elbow.  ""There
are very few bullets left, cousin, and this is all the powder.""

The baronet drew in his breath.  ""Peste! we are unfortunate!  One of you
men go beg, borrow, or steal from the others.""

Landless left his loophole in charge of the Muggletonian and went
swiftly into the hall, where he found the master, his wig off, his shirt
torn, his face and hands blackened with powder, now firing with his own
hand, now shouting encouragement to the panting men.

""Powder and shot!"" he cried.  ""God help us! are you out?  Not a grain or
a bullet can we spare, for if we keep them not from the great door we
are dead men!""

Landless went to the overseer.  ""Two more rounds and _we_ are out,"" said
Woodson coolly, firing as he spoke.

""There is no sign that they have had enough,"" said Landless, as the
clamor outside redoubled, and a man fell heavily back from his loophole
with a bullet through his brain.

""Enough!  Damn them, no!"" said the overseer. ""When they’ve had our lives
they will have had enough—not before!  They’re paying dearly for their
fun though.""

Landless went back to the great room with empty hands.

""They are all in like case,"" he said, in answer to Sir Charles’s lifted
eyebrows.

The other shrugged his shoulders.  ""What will be, will be.  If we could
have saved our fire—but we had to keep them from the door!  Get to your
post, and we will hold them back as long as may be.  Then a short
passage to eternal nothingness!

""A short passage!"" muttered the Muggletonian at Landless’s ear.  ""Well
for those who find that at the hands of the uncircumcised heathen.
Eternal nothingness! The fool hath said in his heart There is no God—and
he is being dashed headlong upon the judgment bar of the God who saith,
I will repay.  Cursed be the Atheist!  May he find the passage, fiery
though it be, as nothing to the flames of the avenging God; may he go to
his appointed place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not
quenched; may—""

The trunk of a tree was dashed against the door with a force that shook
the room.  ""Dey ’re comin’!"" shouted Regulus, who stood behind Sir
Charles, and raised the axe with which he was armed above his head.
Another crash and the wood splintered. Through the ragged opening was
thrust a red hand—the axe, wielded by Regulus’s powerful arms, flashed
downwards, and the hand, severed at the wrist, fell with a dull thud
upon the floor.  A yell from without, and another blow, widening the
opening.  Landless fired his last bullet into the crowd, and clubbing
his musket sprang to the door, in front of which were now massed all the
defenders of that side of the house. Sir Charles threw down his useless
musket, and drew his sword.  ""Cousin,"" he said over his shoulder to
Patricia, standing white and erect in the midst of the cowering women,
""you had best betake yourselves to the hall, and that quickly.  This
will be no ladies’ bower presently.""

""Come,"" said Patricia to the women, and led the way towards the door
leading into the hall.  As she passed Sir Charles she put out her hand,
and he caught it, sunk to his knee, and pressed his lips upon it.

""I am going to my father,"" she said steadily, ""and I shall pray him as
he loves me to pass his sword through my heart when they break into the
hall.  So it is farewell, cousin.""

She drew her hand away and moved towards the door, passing Landless so
closely that her rich skirts brushed him, but without a change in the
white calm of her face.  The terrified women had pressed before her into
the hall, only Betty Carrington keeping by her side.  Her foot was upon
the threshold, when with loud screams they surged back into the great
room. A thundering crash in the hall was followed by a babel of oaths,
screams, triumphant yells.  The voice of the master made itself heard
above all the hubbub, ""Charles, Woodson, Haines, they are upon us!
Defend the women to the last, as you are men, all of you!""

The splintered plank between them in the great room and the murderers
without was dashed inwards. An Indian, naked, horribly painted,
brandishing a tomahawk, sprang through the opening, and Sir Charles ran
him through with his sword.  A second followed, and Landless dashed his
brains out with the butt of his musket.  A third, and the Muggletonian
struck at him through the wildly flaring light and the drifting smoke
wreaths, and missed his aim.  The knife of the savage gleamed high in
air, then, descending, stuck quivering in the breast of the fanatic.  He
sunk to his knees, flung up his skeleton arms, and raised his scarred
face, into which a light that was not of earth had come, then cried in a
loud voice, ""Turn ye, turn ye to the Stronghold, ye prisoners of Hope!""
His eyes closed and he fell forward upon his face, his blood making the
ground slippery about the feet of the others.

Landless closed with the Indian, finally slew him, and turned to behold
a stream, impetuous, not to be withstood, of Indians and negroes pouring
through the doorway.  From the hall came the clash of weapons and a most
terrific din, and presently there burst into the great room the Colonel,
Laramore, Woodson, and Haines, followed by some fifteen men—making, with
the five in the great room, all that were left of the defenders of
Verney Manor.




                            *CHAPTER XXVII*

                               *MORNING*


The women crouched in a far corner of the room behind a barricade of
chairs and tables; the men stood between them and the thirsters for
blood, and fought coolly, desperately, with such effect that, fearful as
were the odds, a glimmering of hope came to them.  The ammunition on
both sides was exhausted, and it had become a hand to hand struggle in
which the advantage of position and weapons was with the assailed.

""Damme, but we will beat them yet!"" cried Laramore, panting, and leaning
heavily upon his rapier. ""They ’re drawing off; we ’ve tired them out!""

""They ’ll never tire while that hellhound of an Indian whoops them on,
and that yellow devil, Luiz Sebastian, backs him up,"" said the overseer.

""They are gathering for a rush,"" said Landless.

The assailants had fallen back to the opposite wall, leaving a space,
cumbered with the dead and slippery with blood, between them and the
defenders of the house.  In this space now appeared the lithe figure,
and the watchful, large-eyed, amber countenance of Luiz Sebastian.

""Ohè!"" he cried, ""slaves, all of you!  Ashantees, Popoes, Angolans,
Fidas, Malimbe, Ambrice! you who are all black! think of the jungle and
the village; think of the wives and the children! think of the slaver
and the slave ship!  You from the Indies, you who are like me, Luiz
Sebastian, think of the blood which is the white man’s blood and yet the
blood of a slave—and hate the white man as I, Luiz Sebastian, hate him!
Kill them and take the women!""

The swollen figure and dreadful face of Roach appeared at his side.
""Ay!"" cried the murderer, with a tremendous oath.  ""Kill them!  Smash
them, batter them, hear them scream!  In the old man’s pocket is the key
of his money chest.  It is filled with bright yellow gold.  Kill him and
get the money, and away to turn pirate and get more!""

""It grows late!"" cried Trail.  ""We must up sail, and away before the
dawn!""

The gigantic, horribly painted form of the Ricahecrian chief stalked
into the open space and commenced a harangue in his own tongue.  It was
short, but effective.

""God!"" said the Colonel, under his breath, and grasped his blood-stained
sword more closely.

With one shrill and horrible cry Indians, negroes, mulattoes, and
villainous whites were upon them, breaking their line, forcing them
apart into knots of two and three away from the frail barrier, behind
which cowered the screaming women, striking with knife and tomahawk, axe
and club.  Two of the Colonel’s men fell, one under the knife of the
seven-year-captive Ricahecrian, the other beaten down by the jagged and
knotted club with which Roach, foaming at the mouth, and swearing
horribly, struck madly to left and right.  The Ricahecrian, drawing the
knife from the heart of his victim, rushed on to where Landless and Sir
Charles still maintained, by dint of desperate fighting, their position
before the women, but Luiz Sebastian with Roach and half a dozen negroes
swept between him and his prey.  He swerved aside, and, bounding into
the midst of the women, seized the one who chanced to be in his path,—a
young and beautiful girl, newly come over from Plymouth, and a favorite
with the ladies of Verney Manor.  The despairing scream which the poor
child uttered rang out above all the tumult.  Landless turned, saw, and
darted to her aid—but too late.  With one hand the savage gathered up
the loosened hair, with the other he passed the scalping knife around
the young head—when Landless reached them, she who so short time before
had been so fair to see, lay a shocking spectacle, writhing in her death
agony.  With white lips and burning eyes Landless swung his gun above
his head, and brought it down upon the shaven crown of Grey Wolf.  It
cracked like an egg shell, and the Indian dropped across the body of his
victim.

Landless, springing back to the post he had quitted, found Sir Charles
in desperate case, but as coolly composed as ever, and with the air of
the Court still about him despite his bared head and torn and
blood-stained clothing, treating those who came against him to an
exhibition of swordsmanship such as the New World had probably rarely
witnessed.  Landless, striking down a cutpurse from Tyburn, saw him run
the Turk through, and saw behind him the nightmare visage and the raised
club of Roach.  He uttered a warning cry, but the club descended, and
the handsome, careless face fell backwards, and the slender debonair
figure swayed and fell.  Landless caught him, saw that he was but
stunned, and letting him drop to the floor at his feet, wrenched the
sword from his hand, and stood over him, facing Roach with a stern
smile.

The murderer raised his club again.

""We’ve met at last!"" he cried with a taunting laugh.  ""Do you remember
the tobacco house, and what I said?  I says: ’Every dog has its day, and
I ’ll have mine.’  It ’s my day now!

""And I said,"" rejoined Landless, ""’I let you go now, but one day I will
kill you.’  And _that_ day has come.

With an oath Roach brought down the club.  Landless swerved, and the
blow fell harmlessly; before the arm could be again raised, he caught
it, held it with a grasp of steel, and shortened his sword.  The
miscreant saw his death, and screamed for mercy. ""Remember Robert
Godwyn!"" said Landless, and drove the blade home.

The sword was a more effective weapon than the gun, and with it he kept
the enemy at bay, while he glanced despairingly around.  There were as
many dead as living within the room by this.  The floor was piled with
the slain; they made traps for the living who in the wild surging to and
fro stumbled over them, and fell, and were slain before they could rise.
Three fourths of the dead belonged to the insurgents, but the attacked
had suffered severely.  Of the thirty men with whom the defense had
commenced there now remained but twelve, and of that number several were
wounded.  The Colonel was bleeding from a cut on the head, the under
overseer had a ball through his arm, Sir Charles still lay without
movement at Landless’s feet.

Forced, together with almost all of his party, by the mad rush of the
assailants to the farther end of the room, the master had seen with
agony the women left well-nigh defenseless.  Followed by Woodson,
Havisham, Regulus, and young Whittington, he had all but cut his way
back to them, when a fresh influx from the hall of slaves and whites who
had been engaged in plundering the house, drove them apart again.

The newcomers came fresh to the work, maddened, moreover, by the
master’s wines.  They advanced upon the Colonel and his party with
drunken shouts, some brandishing rude weapons, others silver salvers and
tankards, the spoil of the plate chest.  The voice of Luiz Sebastian
rang through the room.  ""Quick work of them, friends; I smell the
morning!""  With a laugh and a scrap of Spanish song upon his lips he
came at Landless with a knife, but a turn of the white man’s wrist sent
the weapon hurling through the air.

""Curse you!"" cried the mulatto, springing out of reach of the deadly
point, and holding his arm from which the blood was flowing.  ""Mother of
God! but I will have you yet!"" and bounded towards his weapon. Landless,
steadily watchful, and pointing that fatal sword this way or that
against all comers, cleared for himself and the still senseless man at
his feet a circle into which few cared to intrude, for the fame of that
blade had gone through the room.  ""Leave him until we have dealt with
the others,"" said the mulatto between his teeth.  ""Then will we give him
reason to wish that he had never been born.""

A touch upon his arm, and Landless turned to find Patricia standing
beside him.  ""Go back,"" he cried. ""Go back!""

""They are murdering them all over there,"" she said steadily.  ""My father
is dead.  I saw him fall.""

""Not so, madam.  He did but stumble over the dead.  See, Woodson fights
them back from him. For God’s sake, get back behind the barricade!""

She shook her head.  ""He is dead.  They will all be dead directly, my
cousin and all.  My father cannot help me, and he who lies here cannot
help me.  I will not be taken alive by these devils, and I have no
knife.  Will you kill me?""

""My God!""

""Quick!"" she said in the same low, steady tones. ""They are coming; they
will beat us down in a moment.  Kill me!""

For answer Landless raised his voice until it rang high above the
uproar, and arrested the attention of the combatants on both sides.
""Fight with a will, men,"" he cried, ""for help is at hand!  Do you not
bear the hoofs of the horses?""

""By God! you are right!"" cried the Colonel, suddenly struggling to his
feet.  ""Hold out, men! Anthony Nash reached Rosemead, and has brought us
aid!""

""The dog priest!"" the mulatto cried fiercely to Trail.  ""Was he here?
Then they have sent for help, and Mother of God! it is here!""

""And coming at the planter’s pace,"" answered Trail.  ""They will be upon
us before we reach the boats.""

The mulatto glanced at the friend with whom he had fled the Indies with
a sinister smile.  ""Ay,"" he muttered to himself.  ""They will be upon us
indeed, before we reach the boats, wherefore Luiz Sebastian goes not to
turn pirate this time.  He throws in his lot with the Ricahecrians whose
canoes are close at hand in the inlet that winds into the Pamunkey. They
are very swift, and in the Blue Mountains there is safety.  But one
thing first.""

He gave a shrill and peculiar whistle which brought to him half a dozen
Indians.  He pointed to the body of Grey Wolf and then to Landless.  A
yell burst from the lips of the savages, and they rushed upon the
latter.  He met them, ran his sword through the heart of the first, of
the second: Sir Charles moaned, stirred, and struggled to his knees.  A
third raised his knife; it would have descended, but Landless darted
between the savage and the half-dazed, utterly helpless man at whom the
blow was aimed, struck up the arm, and plunged his sword into the dark
breast. A broken oar, snatched from the floor by the mulatto, descended
upon his head, and with a woman’s scream sounding in his ear, he fell
heavily to the floor, and lay as one dead.

When he came to himself, it was to find the great room still crowded
with men, and filled with noise and confusion, but the thronging figures
and the excited voices were those of friends—of servants from the
neighboring plantations, of small planters and tenants of Colonels
Ludwell and Fitzhugh, the Surveyor-General, and Dr. Anthony Nash.  He
saw the master, panting, bleeding, but exultant, seize Dr. Nash’s hands
in his own.  He saw Sir Charles smile and extend his box of richly
scented snuff to Colonel Ludwell, and the women leaving their corner of
refuge with hysterical laughter and tears; saw Betty Carrington in her
father’s arms, and Mistress Lettice being helped across a heap of dead
by Captain Laramore.  Indians, negroes, mulatto, scoundrel whites, were
gone.

""They got off clear—the d—d villains,"" said Dick Whittington, appearing
beside him, ""just before the horses came up.  But Woodson has gone after
the slaves and the convicts with a party of Carrington’s men.  He ’ll
catch them, I ’m thinking, and they ’ll come to a pirate’s end—that ’s
all the pirating they ’ll get.  The Indians will get clean away; they
’re most to the Pamunkey by now, I reckon.""

Landless staggered to his feet, and put his hand to his head, which was
bleeding.  ""The women are all safe?"" he demanded.

""All but poor Annis,"" said the boy.  ""When I saw the poor maid fall, I
thanked the Lord that Joyce Whitbread was safe in her mother’s cottage
at Banbury.  But none of the others were hurt.  There is Mistress
Lettice and Mistress Betty Carrington—I do not see Mistress Patricia.""

The master of Verney Manor, pouring forth a rapid account of the late
affair to the gentlemen who crowded around him, was brought to a dead
stop by the appearance of a man who had burst through the throng, and
now stood before him, half naked, bleeding, with white, drawn face and
wild eyes.

""What is it?  Speak!"" cried the master, terror of he knew not what
growing in his eyes.

""Your daughter, Colonel Verney!"" cried Landless. ""She is not here.  The
Ricahecrians have carried her off.""

With a sound between a groan and a scream the Colonel staggered, and
would have fallen had not Carrington caught him.  ""Gone!  Impossible!""
cried Sir Charles vehemently, all his studied insouciance thrown to the
winds.  ""She was with the women behind the barrier that we made.  She is
here.""

He began to call her by name, loudly, appealingly, but there came no
answering voice.

""She will not answer,"" said Landless hoarsely. ""She is not here.  She
was with the women until just before the last.  She saw her father fall,
and thought him dead, and you dead, too, Sir Charles Carew, and she came
to me, and prayed me to kill her.  Then we heard the sound of the
horses, and six Indians—Ricahecrians—with Luiz Sebastian, came against
me.  She stood at my side while I killed three.  Then I was struck down,
and I heard her scream as I fell.""

The master freed himself from Carrington’s supporting arm, and raised
from his hands a face that had suddenly become that of an old man.  But
the voice was steady with which he said quietly,—

""Let them search the room thoroughly, for the child may be laying in a
faint beneath these dead, though my soul doth tell me that it is as this
man says, and that she is gone.  But we will after them at once, and,
please God, we will have her back, safe and sound.  They have but an
hour’s start.""

""Ay,"" muttered young Whittington to Havisham. ""Only an hour.  But the
Chickahominies build the swiftest canoes in this corner of the world,
and I have heard that the canoes of the Ricahecrians are to the canoes
of the Chickahominies as swallows are to cranes.""




                            *CHAPTER XXVIII*

                      *BREAD CAST UPON THE WATERS*


Great trees, drooping from the banks of the Pamunkey, shadowed into inky
blackness the water below them; but between the lines of darkness slept
a charmed sheet, glassy, fiery red from the sunken sun.  Three boats
moved silently and swiftly up the crimson stream, until, rounding a low
point, they came upon an Indian village, nestling amidst vines and
mulberries, and girt with a green ribbon of late maize, when they swung
round from the middle stream and made for the bank.  They were rowed by
stalwart servants, and in the foremost sat the master of Verney Manor
and Sir Charles Carew.  In the second boat was the Surveyor-General and
Dr. Anthony Nash, and in the third the overseer, and among the rowers of
this last was Godfrey Landless.

As they neared the bank their occupants saw that the usual sleepy
evening stillness was not upon the village above them.  A shrill sound
of wailing from women and children rose and fell through the gathering
dusk, and in the open space round which the bark wigwams were built,
dark figures moved to and fro in a kind of measured dance, slow and
solemn, and marked at intervals by dismal cries.  As the boats touched
the shore and the white men sprang out, a boy, stationed as scarecrow
upon the usual scaffold in the midst of the maize fields, raised a
shrill whoop of warning which brought the lamentation of the women and
the dance of the men to a dead stop.  The latter rushed down to the
river side, brandishing their weapons, and yelling; but there seemed
little strength in the arms that flourished the tomahawk; the voices
sounded cracked and shrill, and the weak fury and noise died away when a
nearer approach showed the newcomers to be white.  A very aged man, with
a face all wrinkles and a chest all scars, stepped from out the throng
which was now augmented by the women and children.

""My white fathers are far from the salt water. Seldom do the Pamunkeys
see their faces coming up the narrowing stream or through the forest.
They are welcome.  Let my fathers tarry and my women shall bring them
chinquepin cakes and tuckahoe, pohickory and succotash, and my young
men—""

He paused, and a low wailing murmur like the sound of the wind in the
forest rose from the women.

""Where are your young men, your braves?"" demanded the Surveyor-General.
""Here are only the very old and the very young—they who have not seen a
Huskanawing.""

The Indian pointed to the crimson flood below. ""There are my young men;
there are my braves. Among them were a werowance and a sagamore. They
two have strings of pearl thicker than the stem of the grape vine; they
are painted with puccoon, and the feathers of the bluebird and the
redbird are upon them.  They have hills of hatchets and of arrow heads,
sharp and clean, and very much tobacco, and they sing and dance in the
great wigwam of Okee, in the home of Kiwassa, in the land beyond the
setting sun.  But the rest—they lie deep in the slime of the river; it
is red with their blood: their wives wail for them; their village is
left desolate.... When the time of the full sun power was past the
smoking of three pipes, came up the Pamunkey, swift as the swallow that
skims its waters, the Ricahecrian dogs who, passing down towards the
salt water twelve suns ago, slew the young men of a village that lieth
below us.  My young men went out against them, but a cloud came up and
Kiwassa hid his face behind it.  They came not back, their boats were
sunk, the Ricahecrians laughed and went their way, swift as swallows.""’

""Ask him,"" said the Colonel huskily.

""Had they a captive with them—a woman, a paleface woman?"" demanded
Carrington.

""With hair like the sunshine and a white robe. And a man, the color of
the falling sycamore leaf, one of those who work in the fields of the
white fathers.  The arms of the woman were bound, but his were not—he
fought with the Ricahecrian dogs.""

""Luiz Sebastian!"" said the overseer with a muttered oath.  ""I thought as
much when we found that he was not with the drunken scoundrels whom we
took before they reached the Point.  And we had better have killed him
than all the rest put together, for he is the devil incarnate.""

""Let us get on!"" Sir Charles cried impatiently. ""We waste time when
every moment is precious.""

The Colonel, who had been speaking to the Surveyor-General, came over to
him.  All the jovial life and fire was gone from his face, his eyes were
haggard and bloodshot, he stooped like an old man, but the voice with
which he spoke was steady and authoritative as ever.

""Ay,"" he said.  ""We must on at once, but not all of us.  Richard Verney
must not forget the danger of the state, in the danger of his child, nor
let his private quarrel take precedence.  I had hoped when we left the
Manor at dawn to have been up with the villains ere now, but it was not
to be.  This will be a long chase and a stern one, and how it will end
God only knows.  We go into a wilderness from which we may never return.
Behind us in the settlement is turmoil and danger, a conspiracy to be
put down, the Chickahominies to be subdued, the strong hand needed
everywhere.  Every man should be at his post, and Richard Verney,
Lieutenant of his shire, and Colonel of the trainbands, is many leagues
from the danger which threatens the colony, and with his face to the
west.  He must on, but Major Carrington must go back to do his duty to
the King, and Anthony Nash must not desert his flock.  And you, Woodson,
I send back to the Manor to do what you can to repair the havoc there,
and to protect Mistress Lattice.  My kinsman will go on with me; is it
not so, Charles?""

""Assuredly, sir,"" said the baronet quietly.

""I ’d a sight rather go with your Honor,"" growled the overseer, ""but I
’ll do my best both by the plantation and by Mistress Lettice, and I
look for your Honor and Mistress Patricia back in no time at all. We are
to take the small boat, I reckon?""

""Yes, with four men to row you.  We will press a boat and a crew from
the next Pamunkey village. Pick out your men, and let us be gone.""

""Humph!  There ’s one that I reckon had best go back with us.  Does your
Honor know that you’ve got with you the head of all this d—d Oliverian
business, the man that Trail swore was their general—that they all
obeyed as though he were Oliver himself?""

""No!  How came he here?"" cried the master, staring at Landless, who
stood at some distance from them with folded arms and compressed lips,
gazing steadily up the glowing reaches of the river.

""Found him in the boat when I stepped into it myself.  I did n’t say
anything then, for we were in a mortal hurry and he ’s a good rower.
But I reckon your Honor will send him back with me?  He ’ll give you the
slip the first chance he gets.""

""Of course he must go back,"" the master said peremptorily.  ""He should
never have been brought thus far.  A dozen or so of these Oliverians
must swing as an example to the rest, and he, their leader, and a felon
to boot, at their head.  The service he did us last night can not help
him—be fought for his own life.  The Governor has sworn to hang him, and
I am accountable for his safe delivery at Jamestown.  Bind him and take
him back with you, and send him at once to Jamestown under a strong
escort.""  He turned from the overseer to the two gentlemen who were to
go down the river.  ""Carrington, Anthony Nash, old friends, farewell—it
may be forever.  Anthony, pray that I may find my child safe and
spotless.""

They embraced, and he wrung their hands, and, stepping hastily into the
boat, sank down and covered his face with his cloak.  The
Surveyor-General stood with a pale and troubled face, and Dr. Anthony
Nash prayed aloud.  The rowers took their places and the boat shot out
into the middle stream.

Landless, seeing the second boat filling, and supposing that the third
would receive its load in a moment, stepped towards it.  As he passed
the overseer, standing a little to one side with two servants belonging
to Colonel Fitzhugh, a tenant of Colonel Verney, and an Indian from
Rosemead, Woodson put forth an arm and stopped him.

""No, no, my man,"" he said with a grim smile but with a watchful eye, and
nodding to the men to close in around them.  ""Your way’s down, not up.""

""What do you mean?"" cried Landless, recoiling.

""I mean that the Doctor and the Major and I and these men go back to the
settlements to look after things there, and that you are going to renew
your acquaintance with Jamestown gaol.""

For a moment Landless stood, turned to stone, within the other’s grasp,
then with a cry he broke from him and rushed to the water’s edge.  The
boat containing the master had turned her head up stream and was beyond
call; in the second boat the men held the oars poised while Sir Charles,
with one foot upon the gunwale, gave a gravely courteous farewell to the
Surveyor-General and the divine.

""Sir Charles Carew!"" cried Landless.  ""I pray you to take me with you!""

Without moving, Sir Charles looked at him coldly, a peculiar smile just
curling his lip.

""I remember a day,"" he said, ""when you said that I might wait until
doomsday and not hear favor asked of me by you.""

""You are not generous,"" Landless said slowly, ""but I ask the favor.  I
ask it on my knees.  Let me go with you.""

Sir Charles stepped into the boat and took the seat reserved for him.
""I regret,"" he said politely, ""that it comports not with my duty as a
gentleman and an officer of the King to assist you in your very natural
endeavors to escape the gibbet.  Push off, men.""

The boat shot from the shore and up the darkening stream, hastening to
overtake its consort.  Sir Charles raised his Spanish hat and fluttered
a lace handkerchief.  ""To a happier meeting, gentlemen!""  The
Surveyor-General and the divine returned the salute, and stood in
silence watching the canoe with its brawny rowers and the slender,
elegant figure in the stern.  It caught up with the Colonel’s boat and
the two grow smaller and smaller, until they become mere black dots and
the dusk swallowed them up.

Landless watched them too with a face set like a stone.  The overseer,
backed by two of the servants, approached him with caution, but there
was no need,—he submitted to be bound without a word, or struggle, or
change in the expression of his face.  He turned mechanically towards
the boat, but the overseer plucked him back.  ""Not yet,"" he said.  ""We
are all dead beat, and we have not the need to hurry that have those who
are gone on.  The Major ’s commander now, and he says sleep here a few
hours.  I ’ll fasten you so that you can’t get away, I promise ye! Fegs!
it’s a pity that a man who can fight as you fought last night should
have to die a dog’s death after all!  But you ’ve only yourself to thank
for it.""

The red glow died from the river like the scarlet from cooling iron, and
it lay dark and silent, dimly reflecting a myriad of stars.  The sloping
bank, the maize fields, tobacco patch and mulberry grove, the plateau
upon which were ranged the wigwams of the Indians, the dark and endless
forest—all the wide, sombre earth—had their stars also—myriads on
myriads of fire-flies, restlessly sparkling lanterns swung by legions of
fairies.  There was no wind; the cataracts of wild grape descending from
the tops of the tallest trees stirred not a leaf: the pines were
soundless.  But the whip-poor-wills wailed on, and once a catamount
screamed, and the deer, coming to a lick close by, made a trampling over
the fern.

Landless, tightly bound to a great bay tree with thongs of deerskin,
watched the night grow old with hard, despairing eyes.  The stars paled
and the moon rose softly above the tree-tops, silvering the world
beneath.  By her light he saw the little glade of which the tree to
which he was bound marked the centre, and the recumbent forms of those
who were to return to the settlements stretched on Indian mats laid upon
the short grass.  Worn out with the toil of the day and the storm and
stress of the night before, they slumbered heavily.  The watcher in
their midst thought, ""If I could sleep!"" and resolutely closed his eyes,
but the vision of a flying canoe and a brightness of golden hair, which
had vexed him, passing up the reaches of the river over and over and
over again, was with him still, and he opened them and raised them to
the stars, thinking, ""She may be above them now.""

How still it was! no air, no breath, no sound—the thongs, that, wound
many times around his body, bound him to the tree, fell at his feet, a
figure slipped from behind the trunk, laid a hand, in which was a knife
that gleamed in the mooonlight, upon his arm, and whispering, ""Follow,""
glided over the grass, past the sleepers and into the forest.

Swiftly but cautiously Landless went after it.  The overseer lay within
ten feet of him; he passed him, passed the unconscious servants, crossed
a strip of moonlight, entered the shadow of a locust, and all but
stumbled over a man lying asleep beneath it.  He recoiled, and a twig
snapped beneath his foot.  The sleeper stirred, turned upon his side,
and opened his eyes.  The moon, now high in the heavens, shone so
brightly that there was soft light even beneath the heavy branches of
the trees, and by this light his Majesty’s Surveyor-General and his
Majesty’s rebellious, convicted, and condemned servant recognized each
other.  For one long minute they stared each at the other, then, without
a word or sign to denote that he was aware that aught stood between him
and the moonlight, Carrington lay down again, pillowed his head upon his
arm and closed his eyes. Landless was passing on with a light and steady
step and the ghost of a smile upon his lips when the apparently
slumbering figure put forth an arm and laid something long and dark
across his pathway.  He glanced quickly around, but the Surveyor-General
lay motionless, with closed eyes.  Stooping, he took up the object,
which proved to be a richly inlaid musket with flask and pouch.  He
paused again, but no sign coming from the quietly breathing form on the
grass he lightly and silently left it and the tiny encampment and
entered the forest, where he found a dark figure leaning against a tree,
waiting for him.  Without a word it moved forward into the dense shadow
of the forest, and in the same silence he followed it.  They were now in
thick woods, moving beneath interlocking branches and a vast canopy of
wild grape that, stretching from the summit of one lofty tree to that of
another, formed a green and undulating roof upon which beat the
moonbeams that could not penetrate the close darkness of the world
below.  They came to a small and sluggish stream, flowing without noise
between the towering trees, and stepping into the water, walked up it
for a long while with giant blacknesses on either hand and above them
the moon.

All this time the figure had stalked along before Landless without
speaking or turning its head, but now, the trees thinning, and they
coming upon a field of wild flax that lay fair and white beneath the
moon, it quitted the lazy stream, and turning upon Landless as he too
stepped upon the bank, showed him the bronze countenance and the
gigantic form of the Susquehannock to whom he had once done a kindness,
and with whom he had fought on such a night as this, in such a moonlight
space.

""Monakatocka, I thought it had been you,"" said Landless quietly.

With the never failing ""Ugh!"" the Indian took Landless’s hand and with
it touched his own dark shoulder.

""I too am grateful, and with far more reason,"" said Landless smiling.
""I will be yet more so if you will bring me out upon the bank of the
river at some distance above yonder encampment.""

""What will my brother do then?""

""I will go up the river.""

""After the canoes in which sit the palefaces from whom my brother
flees?""

""After the canoe which those canoes pursue.""

""If my brother wishes to take the warpath against the Algonquin dogs,""
said the Indian quietly, ""he must not follow the Pamunkey, but the
Powhatan.""

""They passed this village yesterday, going up the Pamunkey!"" cried
Landless.

""A false trail.  Let my brother come a little further and I will show
him.""

He stepped in front of the white man, and moving rapidly across the
field of flax, dived into the forest again.  Following the stream in its
windings they came to where it debouched into a wide and muddy creek,
which, in its turn, flowed into an expanse of water that lay like molten
silver beyond the fringe of trees.

""The Pamunkey!"" exclaimed Landless.

The Indian nodded and led the way to a thicket of dwarf willow and alder
that grew upon the very brink of the creek.

""While the palefaces slept, Monakatocka was busy.  Look!"" he said,
parting the bushes and pointing.

Within the thicket, drawn up upon the sloping mud, were two large
canoes, quite empty save for a débris of broken oars.

Landless gasped.  ""How do you know them to be the same?""

The Indian stooped and pointed to dark stains. ""Blood.  They had wounded
among them.  And this.""  He put something into the other’s hand.
Landless looked at it, then thrust it into his bosom. ""You are right.
It is a ribbon which the lady wore. But why have they left their boats,
and where are they?""

The Indian pointed to the side of the larger canoe.  ""The hatchets of
the Pamunkeys were sharp. They fought like real men.  This canoe could
go no further.  See, it is wet within—they had to ply the gourd very
fast to keep afloat so far.  One canoe would not hold them all, so they
hid both here.  They knew the palefaces would follow up the river, so
they cared not to stay upon its banks; the Pamunkeys, too, are their
enemies.  They have gone through the forest towards the Powhatan.  My
brother cannot see their trail, for the eyes of the palefaces are
clouded, but Monakatocka sees it.""

Landless turned upon him.  ""Will Monakatocka go with me against the
Ricahecrians?""

""Monakatocka has dreamt of the village on the pleasant river where he
was born.  The arm of the white men cannot reach him here, in these
woods, far from their wigwams and warriors and guns; it cannot pluck him
back to be beaten.  He toils no more in their fields.  He is a real man
again, a warrior of the long house, a chief of the Conestogas.  Let my
white brother go with him, across the great rivers, through the forest,
until they come to the Susquehanna and the village of the Conestogas.
There will the maidens and the young men welcome Monakatocka with song
and dance, and my brother shall be welcome also and shall become a great
chief and shall take the warpath against the Algonquin and against the
paleface at the side of Monakatocka.  In the Blue Mountains is Death.
Let us go to the pleasant river, to the hunting grounds of the
Conestogas.""

Landless shook his head.  ""My thanks and good wishes go with you,
friend, but my path lies towards the Blue Mountains.  Farewell.""

He put out his hand, but the Indian did not touch it.  Instead, he
stooped and examined the ground about him with attention, then,
beckoning the other to follow, he moved rapidly and silently along the
border of the creek.  Landless overtook him and laid his hand upon his
arm, ""This is my path, but yours lies across the river, to the north.""

""If my brother will not go with me, I will go with my brother,"" said the
Conestoga.




                             *CHAPTER XXIX*

                          *THE BRIDGE OF ROCK*


For twenty days they had followed the Ricahecrians. At times the trail
lay before them so plain that even Landless’s unaccustomed eyes could
read it; at times he saw nothing but untrodden ways—no sign to show that
man had been in that wilderness since the beginning of the world—but the
Susquehannock saw and went steadily onward; at times they lost it
altogether, to find it hours, days afterwards.... It had led them
westward, then south to the banks of the Powhatan, then westward again.
At first they had to avoid an occasional clearing with the cabin of a
pioneer rising from it, or some frontier post, or the village of one of
the Powhatan tribes, but that time had long past.  The world of the
white man was far behind them, so far that it might have been another
planet for all it threatened them; the Indian villages were few and far
between and inhabited by tribes whose tongue the Susquehannock did not
know.  For the most part they gave these villages a wide berth, but
sometimes in the quiet of the evening they entered one, and were met by
the eldest man and conducted to the stranger’s lodging where slim brown
maidens came to them with platters of maize cakes and nuts and broiled
fish, and the warriors and old men gathered around, marveling at the
color of the one and conversing with the other in stately gesture.
Sometimes, crouched in a tangle of vines or behind the giant bole of
some fallen tree they watched a war party file past, noiseless, like
shadows, disappearing in the blue haze that filled the distant aisles of
the forest.  Once a band of five attacked them, coming upon them in
their sleep.  Three they killed and the others fled.  They dipped into
the next stream that crossed their path and swam up it a long distance,
then emerged and went their way, tolerably confident that they had
covered their trail. Sometimes they struggled for hours through coverts
of wild grape, thick with fruit: sometimes they walked for miles down
endless colonnades of pine trees, where the needle-strewn ground was
like ice for slipperiness, and the blue sky gleamed faintly through the
far away tree tops.  The wind in the pines rose and fell in long,
measured cadences.  It made the only sound there, for the birds forgot
to sing and the insect world kept silence in those vast and sombre
cathedrals.

On the afternoon of the twentieth day they came to a halt upon the bank
of a small stream that fell purling over a long, smooth slide of
limestone into the river.  Mountains had loomed into existence in the
last few days.  In the distance they made a vast blue rampart which
seemed to prop the western skies. When the sun sank behind them it was
as though a mighty warrior had entered his fortress.  Nearer at hand
they fell into lofty hills, over which the forest undulated in unbroken
green.  In front the river made a sudden turn and was lost to sight,
disappearing through a frowning gateway of gray cliffs as completely as
though it had plunged into the bowels of the earth....  Landless sat
down on the bank of the stream above the fall and, chin in hand, gazed
at the mountain-piled horizon.  The Indian, leaning against a great
sycamore whose branches trailed in the water, watched him attentively.

""My brother is tired,"" he said at last.

Landless shook his head.  The Susquehannock paused, still with his eyes
upon the other’s face, and then went on, ""We have searched and have
found nothing.  There have been five suns since the great rains blotted
out the trail.  My brother has done very much.  Let him say so and we
will go back to the falls of the far west and thence to the northward,
to the pleasant river, to Monakatocka’s people, to the graves of his
fathers.  And my brother will be welcome to the Conestogas, and he shall
be made one of them, and become a great warrior, and both he and
Monakatocka will forget the evil days when they were slaves—until they
meet a paleface from the great water.  My brother has but to speak.""

""If these hills in front of us,"" said Landless with gloomy emphasis,
""were higher than the Alps, I would climb them.  If behind them there
were another range, and then another, and another, if we looked upon the
nearest wave of an ocean of mountains, I would climb them all.  If they
are before us, sooner or later I shall find them.  But not to know that
they are before us!  To know that they may be to the north of us, may be
to the south of us! that we may even have passed them! it is maddening!""

""We have not passed them,"" said his companion slowly, ""for—"" he stopped
abruptly, broke off a bough from a sumach bush beside him, and falling
on his knees, leaned far out over the stream.  There were many tiny
cascades in the brook with little eddies below them where sticks and
leaves circled gaily around before they were drawn on to the next
miniature fall, and into one of these eddies the Indian plunged the
bough.  The next moment he drew it carefully towards him, something
white clinging to one of its twigs.  It proved to be a fragment of
lace—not more than an inch or two—and it might have been torn from a
woman’s kerchief.  Landless’s hand closed over it convulsively.

""It came down the stream!"" he cried.

The other nodded.  ""Monakatocka saw it slip over that fall.  It has not
been in the water long.""

""Then—my God!—they are close at hand!  They are up this stream!""

The Indian nodded again with a look of satisfaction upon his bronze
features.  Landless raised his eyes to the cloudless blue, and his lips
moved.  Then, without a word he turned his face up the mountain stream,
and the Indian followed him.

For an hour they crept warily onward, following the stream in its
capricious wanderings.  A broken trailer of grapevine, a pine cone that
had been crushed under foot, the print of a moccasin on a bit of muddy
ground told them that they had indeed recovered the long lost trail.
They moved silently, sometimes creeping on hands and knees through the
long grass where the bank was barren of bushes, sometimes gliding
swiftly through a friendly covert of alder or sumach. The hills closed
in upon them, and became more precipitous.  The stream made another
bend, and they were in a ravine where the water flowed over a rocky bed
between banks too steep to afford them secure foothold.  The
Susquehannock swung himself down into the shallow water, and motioned to
his companion to do likewise.  ""Monakatocka smells fire,"" he whispered.

A moment later they rounded an overhanging, fern-clad rock, and came
full upon that at which Landless stared with a sharp intake of his
breath, and which even his impassive guide greeted with a long-drawn
""Ugh!"" of amazement.

Towards them brawled the impetuous stream through a wonderful gorge.
The precipitous hillsides, clothed with a stately growth of oak and
chestnut, changed suddenly into a sheer and awful mass of rock.  On
either side of the stream towered up the mighty walls until, two hundred
feet above the water, they swept together, spanning the chasm with a
majestic arch.  Great trees crowned it; trailers of grape and clematis
made the span one emerald; below, through the vast opening, shone the
evening sky with little, rosy clouds floating across it.  A bird,
flashing downwards from the far-off trees, showed black against the
carnation of the heavens.

The Indian uttered another ""Ugh!"" then stole forward a pace or two,
stood still, and waited for the other to come up.  ""My brother sees,"" he
said simply.

From a covert of arbor-vitæ they looked directly up the creek and
through the archway.  Beneath it, and for a few yards on the hither
side, the water flowed in a narrower channel, leaving a little strip of
boulder-strewn shore.  With a leap of his heart Landless saw, rising
from this shore, the blue smoke of a newly kindled fire, and squatting
about it, or flitting from place to place, a dozen or more dark figures.
At a little distance from the fire, close against the wall of rock, had
been hastily constructed a rude shed or arbor.  As he gazed at this
frail shelter, he saw the flutter of a white gown pass the opening which
served as door.

""Night soon,"" said Monakatocka at his ear.  ""Then will my brother see
one Iroquois cheat all these Algonquin dogs.""

They drew further back into the dense shade of the overhanging boughs.
A large flat boulder afforded them a secure resting-place, and drawing
their feet from the stream, the two curled themselves up side by side
upon its friendly surface.  The Indian took some slices of venison from
his wallet, and they made a slender meal, then set themselves patiently
to await the night and the time for action.  The tiny encampment was
hidden from them by the thick boughs, but through the screen of
delicate, aromatic leaves they could see the bridge of rock.  Around
them was the stir and murmur of the summer afternoon—the wind in the
trees, the whir of insects, the song of birds, the babble of the
water—but far above, where the great arch cut the sky, the world seemed
asleep.  The trees dreamed, resting against the crimson and gold of the
heavens.  The Indian’s appreciation of the wonders of nature was
limited—with a grunted, ""All safe: wake before moonrise,"" he turned upon
his side, and was asleep.

His Anglo-Saxon neighbor watched the pensive beauty of the evening with
a softened heart.  The glory behind the tremendous rock faded, giving
place to tender tints of pearl and amethyst.  Above the distant tree
tops swam the evening star.  In the half light the shadowy forest on
either hand blended with the great bridge carved by some mysterious
force from the everlasting hills.  Together they made a mountain of
darkness pierced by a titanic gateway through which one looked into
heavenly spaces.  The chant of the wind swelled louder.  It was like the
moan of distant breakers.  The night fell, and the stars came out one by
one until the blue vault was thickly studded. Up and down the sides of
the ravine flickered millions of fireflies.  Their restless glimmer
wearied the eyes. Landless raised his to the one star, large, calm and
beautiful, and prayed, then thought of all that star shone upon that
night—most of the white town of his boyhood, lying fair and still like a
dream town, above a measureless, slumberous sea.  A great calm was upon
him.  Toil and danger were past; passionate hope and settled despair
were past.  That he would do what he had come this journey to do, he now
had no doubt,—would not have doubted had there been encamped between him
and the frail shed built against the rock all the Indians this side of
the South Sea.

The stars that shone through the great archway slowly paled, the stream
became dull silver, and down the towering darkness on either hand fell a
soft and tremulous light like a veil of white gauze.  Landless put out
his hand to waken the sleeping Indian, and touched bare rock.  A moment
later the branches before him parted.  He had heard no sound, but there,
within three feet of him, were the high features and the bold eyes of
the Susquehannock.

""Monakatocka has been to the great rock,"" he said in a guttural whisper.
""The Algonquin dogs sleep sound, for they do not know that a Conestoga
is on their trail.  They have camped beneath the rock three days, and
they will move on the morrow.  They have built a shed for the maiden
against the rock.  About it lie the Ricahecrians, the moccasins of one
touching the scalp lock of another.  They keep no watch, hut they have
scattered dried twigs over all the ground. Tread on them, and the god of
the Algonquins will make them speak very loud.  But a Conestoga is
cunning.  Monakatocka has found a way.""

""Then let us go,"" said Landless, rising.

As they crept from out their leafy covert, the moon appeared over the
tree-tops far above them, flooding the glen with light, and making a
restless shimmer of diamonds of the rushing brook.  The two men moved
warily up the stream, setting their feet with care upon the slippery
stones.  Once Landless stumbled, but caught at a huge boulder, and saved
himself from falling, sending, however, a stone splashing down into the
water.  They drew themselves up within the shadow of the rock, and
listened with straining ears, but there came no answering sound save the
cry of a whip-poor-will, and they went on their way.  When they were
within a hundred feet of the encampment, the Indian left the stream,
crossed the strip of earth between it and the cliff, and pointed to a
broken and uneven line that ran at a height of some five feet from the
ground along the face of the cliff.  Landless looked and saw a very
narrow ledge, a mere projection here and there of jagged and broken
rock, a pathway perilous and difficult as might well be imagined. So
narrow and insignificant it looked, such a mere seam along the vast
wall, that a white man passing through the ravine might never have
noticed it.

""It is our path,"" said the Susquehannock.  ""It leads above the heads of
these dogs and their crackling twigs, straight to where lies the
maiden.""

Without a word Landless caught at the stem of a cedar projecting from a
fissure in the rock, and swung himself up to the cleft.  The Indian
followed, and with silence and caution they commenced their dangerous
journey.  Landless was no novice at such work. When a boy, he had often
rounded the face of frowning white cliffs with the sea breaking in
thunder a hundred feet below.  Then a bird’s nest had been the prize of
high daring, death the penalty of dizziness or a misstep.  Now, although
not two yards below him was the solid earth, a misstep would send him
crashing down to a more fearful doom—but the prize! A light was in his
eyes as he crept nearer and nearer to the shed built against the rock.

They passed the smouldering embers of a large fire, and came full upon
the circle of sleeping Indians. They lay in the moonlight like fallen
statues, their bronze limbs motionless, their high, stern features
impassive as death.  From their belts came the glint of tomahawk and
scalping knife, and beside each warrior lay his bow and quiver of
arrows.  Only one man had a gun.  It lay in the hollow of his arm, its
barrel making a gleaming line against his dark skin.  The skin was not
so dark as was that of the other recumbent figures, and the face, flung
back and pillowed on the arm, was not the face of an Indian.  It was
Luiz Sebastian.  He lay somewhat nearer to the shed than did the
Ricahecrians, and directly in front of the doorway; as Landless paused
above him, he turned and laughed in his sleep.

Slowly and cautiously Landless swung himself down from the ledge, his
moccasined feet touching ground that was clear of pebbles and beyond the
line of twigs. He glanced back to see the gigantic figure of the
Susquehannock, standing upright against the rock, knife in hand, and
watchful eyes roving from one to the other of the sleeping warriors,
then stepped lightly across the body of the mulatto, and entered the
hut.

Within it the darkness was gross.  Pausing a moment to accustom his eyes
to the blackness, there came to him from without the hoot of an owl.  It
was the signal agreed upon between him and his companion, and he wheeled
to face the danger it announced.

The lithe, yellow figure that had lain in front of the doorway had
waked.  As Landless gazed, it rose to its knees, then with a quick,
cat-like grace to its feet, stretched itself, cast a listening look
around the sleeping circle, and laid its gun softly down, then with a
noiseless step and a smile upon its evil face, it, too entered the hut.

Landless waited until the mulatto was well across the threshold, and
then sprang upon him, dragging him to the ground, where he held him with
his knee against his chest.  He writhed and struggled, but the white man
was the stronger, and held him down: he tried to cry out, but the
other’s hands were at his throat choking the life from him.  Putting all
his strength into one hand, Landless felt with the other for his knife.
The movement brought his face forward into the shaft of moonlight that
trembled through the opening.  ""You!"" said the eyes of the mulatto, and
his clutching hands tore at the hand about his throat.  The hand pressed
closer, and with the other Landless struck the knife into the yellow
bosom. When the writhing form was quite still, he rose from his knees,
and looked down upon the evil face flung back to meet the moonlight.
The struggle had lasted but a minute, and had been without sound—not a
sleeping savage had stirred.  But he now heard frightened breathing
within the hut.  By this his eyes were accustomed to the darkness, and
he made out something white niched into the corner opposite.  As he
advanced towards it, it started away, and would have brushed past him,
but he seized it.  ""Madam!"" he whispered.  ""Do not scream.  It is I,
Godfrey Landless.""

In the darkness he felt the rigor of terror leave the form which he
held.  It swayed against him, and the head fell back across his arm.  He
raised the fainting figure, and stepping across the body of the mulatto
issued from the shed, to find Monakatocka standing beside the entrance,
knife in hand, and watchfully regardful of the sleeping Ricahecrians.




                             *CHAPTER XXX*

                          *THE BACKWARD TRACK*


Landless turned to the pathway by which they had come, but the Indian
shook his head, and pointing to the stream which, making a sudden turn,
brawled along at their very feet, stepped noiselessly down into the
water, first, however, possessing himself of Luiz Sebastian’s gun, which
lay upon the ground beside the hut.  Landless, following him in silence,
would have turned his face towards the river, but again the
Susquehannock shook his head and began to make his way slowly and warily
up stream.

The other knew how to obey.  Holding with one arm the unconscious form
of the woman he had come so many leagues to seek, and with the other
steadying himself by boulder and projecting cliff, he followed his
companion past the sleeping Ricahecrians, out of the shadow of the great
arch, into the splendor of the moonlight beyond.  It was not until they
had gone a long distance, past vast, scarred cliffs, through close,
dark, scented tunnels formed by the overarching boughs of great
arbor-vitæs, up smooth slides where the water came down upon them in
long, unbroken, glassy green slopes, that Landless said, in a low voice:
""Why do we go up this stream instead of back to the river?  It is their
road we are traveling.""

The faint, reluctant smile of the Indian crossed the Susquehannock’s
face.  ""The white man is very wise except when he is in the woods.  Then
he is as if every brook ran fire-water and he had drunk of them all.  A
pappoose could trick him.  When these Algonquin dogs wake and find the
fawn fled and the yellow slave killed, they will cast about for our
trail, and they will find that we came up from the river. Then, when
they find no backward track, but only that we entered the water there,
before the maiden’s hut, they will think that we have gone down the
stream, back to the river.  They will go down to the river themselves,
but when they have reached it they will not know what to do.  They will
think, ’They who come after the Ricahecrians into the Blue Mountains
must be many, with great hearts and with guns.’  They will think, ’They
came in boats, and one of their braves and one Iroquois, stealing up
this stream, came upon the Ricahecrians when Kiwassa had closed their
eyes and their ears, and stole away the fawn that the Ricahecrians had
taken, and killed the man who fled with them from the palefaces.’  And
it will take a long time for them to find that there were no boats and
that but two real men have followed them into the Blue Mountains, for I
covered our trail where this stream runs into the river very carefully.
After a while they will find it, and after another while they will find
that the chief of the Conestogas and his white brother and the maiden
have gone up the stream, and they will come after us.  But that will not
be until after the full sun power, and by then we must be far from
here.""

""It is good,"" said Landless briefly.  ""Monakatocka has the wisdom of the
woods.""

""Monakatocka is a great chief,"" was the sententious reply.

""Do you think they will follow us when they find how greatly we have the
start of them?""

""They will be upon our track, sun after sun, keen-eyed as the hawk,
tireless as the wild horses, hungry as the wolf, until we reach the
tribes that are friendly to the palefaces.  And that will be many suns
from now.  I told my brother that we followed Death into the Blue
Mountains.  Now Death is upon our trail.""

They came to a rivulet that emptied itself into the larger stream, and
the Susquehannock led the way up its bed.  Presently they reached a
gently sloping mass of bare stone, a low hill running some distance back
from the margin of the stream.

""Good,"" grunted the Susquehannock.  ""The moccasin will make no mark here
that the sun will not wipe out.""

They clambered out upon the rock and stood looking down the ravine
through which they had come. ""My brother is tired,"" said the Indian.
""Monakatocka will carry the maiden.""

""I am not tired,"" Landless answered.

The Indian looked at the face, thrown back upon the other’s shoulder.
""She is fair, and whiter than the flowers the maidens pluck from the
bosom of the pleasant river.""

""She is coming to herself,"" said Landless, and laid her gently down upon
the rock.

Presently she opened her eyes quietly upon him as he knelt beside her.
""You came,"" she said dreamily. ""I dreamt that you would.  Where are my
father and my cousin?""

""Seeking you still, madam, I doubt not, though I have not seen them
since the day after you were taken.  They went up the Pamunkey and so
missed you.  Thanks to this Susquehannock, I am more fortunate.""

She lay and looked at him calmly, no surprise, but only a great peace in
her face.  ""The mulatto,"" she said, ""I feared him more than all the
rest.  When I saw him enter the hut I prayed for death.  Did you kill
him?""

""I trust so,"" said Landless, ""but I am not certain, I was in too great
haste to make sure.""

""I do not care,"" she said.  ""You will not let him hurt me—if he
lives—nor let the Indians take me again?""

""No, madam,"" Landless said.

She smiled like a child and closed her eyes.  In the moonlight which
blanched her streaming robe and her loosened hair that, falling to her
knees, wrapped her in a mantle of spun gold, she looked a wraith, a
creature woven of the mist of the stream below, a Lorelei sleeping upon
her rock.  Landless, still upon his knee beside her, watched her with a
beating heart, while the Susquehannock, leaning upon his gun, bent his
darkly impassive looks upon them both.  At length the latter said, ""We
must be far from here before the dogs behind us awake, and the Gold Hair
cannot travel swiftly.  Let us be going.""

""Madam,"" said Landless.

She opened her eyes and he helped her to her feet. ""We must hasten on,""
he said gently.  ""They will follow us and we must put as many leagues as
possible between us before they find our trail.""

""I did not think of that!"" she said, with dilating eyes.  ""I thought it
was all past—the terror—the horror!  Let us go, let us hasten!  I am
quite strong; I have learned how to walk through the woods.  Come!""

The Indian glided before them and led the way over the friendly rocks.
They left them and found themselves upon a carpet of pine needles, and
then in a dell where the fern grew rankly and the rich black earth gave
like a sponge beneath their feet.  Here the Indian made Landless carry
Patricia, and himself came last, walking backwards in the footprints of
the other, and pausing after each step to do all that Indian cunning
could suggest to cover their trail. They came to more rocky ledges and
walked along them for a long distance, then found and went up a wide and
shallow stream.  Slowly the pale light of dawn diffused itself through
the forest.  In the branches overhead myriads of birds began to flutter
and chirp, the squirrels commenced their ceaseless chattering, and
through the white mist, at bends of the stream, they saw deer coming
from the fern of the forest to drink.  A great hill rose before them,
bare of trees, covered only with a coarse growth of grass and short blue
thistles in which already buzzed a world of bees; they climbed it and
from the summit watched a ball of fire rise into the cloudless blue. The
morning wind, blowing over that illimitable forest, fanned their brows,
and a tide of woodland sound and incense swept up to them from the world
below.  Around them were the Blue Mountains—gigantic masses, cloudy
peaks, vast ramparts rising from a sea of mist—mysterious fastnesses,
scarcely believed in and never seen by the settlers of the level land—a
magic country in which they placed much gold and the wandering colonists
of Roanoke, the South Sea, and long-gowned Eastern peoples.

""Oh, the mountains!"" said Patricia.  ""The dreadful, frowning mountains!
When will we be quit of them?  When, will we reach the level land and
the blue water?""

""Before many days, I trust,"" said Landless.  ""See, our faces are set to
the east—-towards home.""

She stood in silence for a moment, her face lifted, the color slowly
coming back to her cheeks and the light to her eyes, then said
suddenly:—

""Did my father send you after me?""

""No, madam.""

""Then how are you here?""

He looked at her with a smile.  ""I broke gaol—and came.""

A shadow crossed her face, but it was gone in a moment.  ""I am very
grateful,"" she said.  ""You have saved me from worse than death.""

""It is I that am thankful,"" he answered.

They descended the hill in silence and found the Susquehannock, who had
preceded them, squatted before a fire which he had kindled upon a flat
rock beside one of the innumerable streamlets that wound here and there
over the land.

""The dogs yonder will need Iroquois eyes to spy out this trail,"" he said
with grim satisfaction, as they came up to him.  ""Let my brother and the
Gold Hair rest by the fire, and Monakatocka will go into the forest and
get them something to eat.""

He was gone, his gigantic figure looking larger than life as he moved
through the mist which still filled the hollow between the hills, and
Landless and Patricia sat themselves down beside the fire.  Landless
piled upon it the dead wood with which the ground was strewn, and the
flames leaped and crackled, sending up thin blue smoke against the
hillside and reddening the bosom of the placid stream.  When he had
finished his task and taken his seat, there fell a silence and
constraint upon the man and woman, brought through so many strange and
wayward paths, through lives so widely differing, to this companionship
in the heart of a waste and savage world.  They sat opposite each other
in the ruddy light of the fire, and each, looking into the dark or
glowing hollows, saw there the same thing—the tobacco house and what had
there passed.

""I wish to believe in you,"" said Patricia at last, lifting appealing
eyes to the opposite face.  ""But how can I?  You lied to me!""

Landless raised his head proudly.  ""Madam, will you listen to me—to my
defense if you will?  You are a Royalist: I am a Commonwealth man.  Can
you not see, that as ten years ago, in the estimation of you and yours,
it was all that was just and heroic for a Cavalier to plot the downfall
of the Government which then was, both here and at home, so they of the
Commonwealth saw no disgrace in laboring for their cause, a cause as
real and as high and as holy to them, madam, as was that of the Stuart
and the Church to the Cavalier....  And will not the slave fight for his
liberty?  Is it of choice, do you think, that men lie rotting in prison,
in the noisome holds of ships, are bought and sold like oxen, are
chained to the oar, to the tobacco field, are herded with the refuse of
the earth, are obedient to the finger, to the whip? We—they who are
known as Oliverians, and they who are felons, and I who am, if you
choose, of both parties, were haled here with ropes.  What allegiance
did we owe to them who had cast us out, or to them who bought us as they
buy dumb beasts?  As God lives, none!  We were no longer regarded as
men, we were chattels, animals, slaves, caged, and chained. And as the
caged beast will break his bars if he can, so we strove to break ours.
You have been a captive, madam.  Is not freedom sweet to you?  We also
longed for it.  We staked our lives upon the throw—and lost.  That dream
is over,—let it go! ... There is honor among rebels, madam, as among
thieves.  That morning after the storm, I had the choice of lying to you
or of becoming a traitor indeed.... But as to what I had before asked
you to believe, that was the truth, is the truth.  I know that in your
eyes I am still the rebel to the King, well deserving the doom which
awaits me, but if, after what I say to you, by the faith of a gentleman,
before the God who is above the stillness of these hills, you still
believe me criminal in aught else, you wrong me much, you wrong
yourself!""

He ceased abruptly, and rising, began to heap more wood upon the fire.
The figure of the Indian, with something dark upon its shoulder, emerged
from the spectral forest, and came towards them through the mist.

""Monakatocka has found our breakfast,"" said Landless, forcing himself to
speak with indifference, and without looking at his companion.  ""I am
glad of it, for you must be faint from hunger.""

""I am very thirsty,"" she said in a low voice.

""If you will come to the water’s edge, that at least can be quickly
remedied.""

She rose from the rock upon which she had been seated and followed him
down to the brink of the little stream.  ""I would I had a cup of gold,""
he said, ""and here is not even a great leaf.  Will you drink from my
hands, madam?""

""Yes,"" she said; then deliberately, after a pause, ""for I well believe
them to be clean hands.""

Her own hand touched his as she spoke, and he put it to his lips in
silence.  Kneeling upon the turf by the stream, he raised the water in
his hands and she stooped and drank from them, and then they went back
to the fire and sat beside it without speaking until the arrival of
Monakatocka, laden with a wild turkey.  An hour later the Susquehannock
carefully extinguished the fire, raked all the embers and ashes into the
stream, hid beneath great rocks the débris of their morning meal,
obliterated all moccasin prints, and having made the little hollow
between the hills to all appearance precisely as it was a few hours
before, when the foot of man had probably never entered it, stepped into
the stream and announced that they were ready to pursue their journey.
Before midday, the stream winding to the south, they left it, and
plunging into the dark heart of the forest pushed rapidly on with their
faces to the east.




                             *CHAPTER XXXI*

                       *THE HUT IN THE CLEARING*


Five days later saw the wayfarers some thirty leagues to the eastward of
the hollow in the hills. They had traveled swiftly, sleeping but a few
hours of each night and in the daytime pausing for rest only when
Landless, quietly watchful, saw the weariness growing in the eyes of the
woman beside him, or noted her lagging footsteps.  They had left the
higher mountains behind them, but still moved through what seemed an
uninhabited territory.  No Indian village crowned the hills above the
streams; they encountered no roving bauds; no solitary hunter met them;
nowhere was there sign of human life.  If their enemies were upon their
track, they knew it not—perfect peace, perfect solitude seemed to
encompass them.  Still the Indian was vigilant; covering their trail
with unimaginable ingenuity, taking advantage of every running stream,
every stony hillside, building a fire only in some hidden hollow or fold
of the hills, using his bow and arrow to bring down the deer or wild
fowl which furnished them food—he stalked behind them, or sat bolt
upright against the tree or rock beneath which they had made their
resting place, tireless, watchful, the breathing image of caution.  If
he slept, it was a sleep from which the sound of a falling acorn, the
sleepy stir of a partridge in the fern was sufficient to awaken him.
Sometimes they rested by fires, for they heard the wolves through the
darkness; upon the nights when this was necessary the Susquehannock sat
with his gun across his knees, piercing the darkness in every direction
with keen and restless eyes.  Nothing worse than the wolves—cowardly as
yet, for though drawing swiftly nearer, winter and famine were still
distant—threatened them; no sound other than the forest sounds disturbed
them; through the scant undergrowth or over the moss and partridge berry
brushed nothing more appalling than bear or badger.  But the Indian
watched on.

Day after day Landless and Patricia walked side by side through the
reddening forest.  His hands steadied her over crags or down ravines, or
broke a way for her through vast beds of sassafras or mile-long tangles
of wild grape, and when their way lay along the bed of streams he
carried her.  She had no need to complain of fatigue, for he saw when
she was weary, and called a halt.  At their rustic meals he waited upon
her with grave courtesy, and when they halted for the night he made her
couch of fallen leaves and wove for it a screen of branches.  They spoke
but little and only of the needs of the hour.  She bore herself towards
him kindly and gently, thanking him with voice and smile for all that he
did for her, and there was no mistrust in her eyes; but he saw, or
fancied he saw, a shadow in their depths, and thinking, ""She does not
forget, and neither must I,"" he set a watch upon himself, and bounds,
across which he was not to step.

Upon the afternoon of the sixth day they were passing through a deep and
narrow ravine—a mere crack between two precipitous, heavily wooded
mountains—when the Indian stopped short in his tracks and uttered a
warning ""Ugh!"" then bent forward in a listening attitude.

""What is it?"" asked Landless in a low voice.  ""I hear nothing.""

""It is a sound,"" said the other in the same tone. ""I do not know what
yet, for it is far off.  But it is in front of us.""

""Shall we go on?"" demanded Landless, and the Indian nodded.

It was late afternoon, and the hills which closed in behind them as the
gorge writhed to left and right hid the sun.  Great trees, too, pine and
chestnut, walnut and oak, leaned towards each other from the opposing
banks, and together with the overhanging rocks, mantled with fern, made
a twilight of the pass beneath.  Here and there the silver stem of a
birch stood up tall and straight, and looked a ghostly sentinel.  ""Do
you hear it still?"" demanded Landless when they had gone some distance
in dead silence.

""Yes.""

""And still in front of us?""

""Yes.""

""Ah, what can it be?"" cried Patricia, turning her white face upon
Landless.

A cold wind, blowing from open spaces beyond, rushed up the ravine.  ""I
hear a very faint sound,"" said Landless, ""like the tapping of a
woodpecker in the heart of the forest.""

""It is the sound of the axe of the white man,"" said the Indian.  ""Some
one is cutting down a tree.""

""There can be no ranger or pioneer within many leagues of us!"" exclaimed
Landless.  ""No white man hath ever come so far.  It must be an Indian!""

The Susquehannock shook his head.  ""Why should an Indian cut down a
tree?  We kill them and let them stand until they are bare and white
like the bones of a man when the wolves have finished with him, and they
fall of themselves.""

""If my father still searches for me,"" said Patricia in a low voice, ""may
it not be his party that we hear? There may be a stream there.  They may
make canoes.""

""With all my heart I pray that it be so, madam,"" said Landless.  ""But we
will soon know.  See, Monakatocka has gone on ahead.""

She did not answer, and they walked on through the gloom of the defile.
Presently their path became rough and broken, blocked with large stones
and heavily shadowed by cedars projecting from the rocks above and
draped with vines.  He held out his hands and she took them, and he
helped her across the rough places.  He felt her hands tremble in his,
and he thought it was with the ecstasy of the hope which inspired her.

""If it is indeed so,"" she said once in a voice so low that he had to
bend to catch the words, ""if it is indeed my father, then this is the
last time you will help me thus.""

""Yes,"" he answered steadily.  ""The last time.""

They passed the rocks and came to where the ravine widened.  The sound
that had perplexed them was now plainly audible; there was no mistaking
the quick, ringing strokes of the axe.  They rounded a jutting cliff and
abruptly emerged from the chill darkness of the gorge upon a noble
landscape of hill and valley, autumn woods and flowing water, all bathed
in the golden light of the sinking sun and inestimably bright and
precious of aspect after the gloom through which they had been
traveling.  But it was not the beauty of the scene which drew an
exclamation from them both.  At a little distance rose a knoll, covered
with short grass and fading golden-rod, and with its base laved by a
crystal stream of some width, and upon the knoll, shaded by a couple of
magnificent maples, and covered with the pale and feathery bloom of the
wild clematis, stood a small, rude hut.  Smoke rose from its crazy
chimney, and upon the strip of greensward before the door rolled a
little, half-naked child—a white child.  As the travelers stared in
amazement, a woman’s voice rang out, freshly and sweetly, in an English
ballad.  The trees had been cleared away from around the knoll, and in
their place rose the yellowing stalks of Indian corn.  The little mound,
feathered with the gold of the golden-rod and girt with the gold of the
maize, rose like a fairy isle from the limitless sea of forest, and the
apparition of a troop of veritable elves would have astonished the
wanderers less than did the tiny cabin, the romping child, and the clear
song of the woman.

The Indian glided to their side from behind the trunk of an oak.  ""Ugh,""
he said with emphasis. ""He is mad and so he has his scalp still.""  As he
spoke he pointed to where, at a little distance, a man, with his back
turned to the forest, was busily felling a tree.

""He dares much,"" said Landless.  ""We did not think to see the face of a
white man—pioneer, ranger, trapper or trader—for many a league yet.  He
has built his house in the jaws of the wolf.""

Patricia gazed at the hut with wistful eyes.  ""There is a woman there,""
she said, and Landless heard her voice tremble for the first time in
their long, toilsome and painful journey.  ""There is no need to pass
them by, is there?  It looks very fair and peaceful.  May we not rest
here for this one night?""

""Yes,"" said Landless gently, reading, as he read all her fancies and
desires, her longing for the companionship of a woman, though for so
short a time.  The Indian, too, nodded assent.  ""Good! but Monakatocka
will watch to-night.""

They moved through the checkered light and shade towards the man who
worked at the foot of the knoll. They were quite near him when the
woman, whose voice they had heard, came to the door of the cabin, shaded
her eyes with her hand, looked towards the ravine, and saw the three
figures emerging from it. With a loud cry she snatched up the child at
her feet and rushed down the knoll towards the man, who at the sound of
her voice dropped his axe, caught up a musket which leaned against a
stump beside him, and wheeling, presented the gun at the newcomers.

""Give me your kerchief, madam,"" said Landless, and advanced with the
white lawn in his hand.

""Halt!"" cried the man with the gun.

""We are friends,"" called Landless.  ""This lady and I are from the
Settlements.  This Indian is not Algonquin, but Iroquois—a
Susquehannock, as you may tell by his size.  You need have no fear.  We
are quite alone.""

The man slowly lowered his gun.  ""What, in the name of all the fiends,
do you here?"" he said, wiping away with the back of his hand the cold
sweat that had sprung to his forehead.  He was a tall man with a sinewy
frame and a dare-devil face, tanned to well-nigh the hue of the Indian.

""I might ask the same question of you,"" said Landless, coming up to him
with a smile.  ""This lady was captured and carried off by a band of
roving Ricahecrians who bore her into the Blue Mountains. We ask your
hospitality for to-night.  The lady is very weary, and she has not seen
the face of a woman for many weeks.  Your good wife will entreat her
kindly, I know.""

The woman, who now stood beside the man, smiled, but doubtfully; the
man’s face too was clouded, and there was an uneasy light in his eyes.
Landless, looking steadily at him, saw upon his forehead a mark which
served to explain his evident perturbation.

""You need not fear me,"" he said quietly.  ""’T is none of our business
how you come to be here in this wilderness, so far from what has been
counted the furthest outpost.""

The man, feeling his gaze upon him, raised his hand with an involuntary
motion to his forehead, then dropped it, awkwardly enough.

""I see,"" said Landless.  ""I understand.  I have been—I am—a servant.  A
runaway, too, if you like. I have been in trouble.  I would not betray
you if I could: that I cannot, goes without saying.  Now, will you
shelter us for this night?""

""Yes,"" said the man, his face clearing.  ""As you say, you could n’t do
us harm if you would, seeing that masters, and d—d overseers, and
bloodhounds are at the world’s end for us.  We are beyond their reach.
Bring up the lady.  Joan, here, will see to her.""

An hour later the woman and Patricia sat side by side upon the doorstep
in the long mountain twilight. At their feet the little child crowed and
clapped its hands, and plucked at the golden-rod growing about the door.
Below them, beside the placid stream, the owner of the hut and Godfrey
Landless paced slowly up and down, now disappearing into the shadow of
the trees, now dimly seen in the open spaces, while the Indian lay at
full length beneath the maples, with his eye upon the blackness of the
ravine down which they had come.

""It is fair to look upon, and peaceful,"" Patricia said dreamily, ""but
Danger lives in these dreadful mountains.  Why did you come here?""

""We came because we loved,"" the woman said simply.

""But why into the very land of the savages, so far from safety, so far
from the Settlements?""

The woman turned her eyes upon the beautiful face beside her and studied
it in silence.

""I will tell you,"" she said at last, ""for I believe you are as good as
you are beautiful, and you are as beautiful as an angel.  And, though I
can see that you are a lady, yet you are woman too, as I am, and you
have suffered much, as I have, and have loved too, I think, as I have
loved.""

""I have never loved,"" said Patricia.

The woman smiled, and shook her head.  ""There is a look in the eyes that
only comes with that.  I know it.""  She gathered the child to her, and
beating its little hand against her bosom, began her story:—

""It is four years since I signed to come to the Plantations, to become
the servant of an up-river planter—and to better myself.  It was a hard
life, my lady, a hard life—you cannot guess how hard.... One day a
neighboring planter sent a message to my master, and I (for I served in
the house) took it from the messenger.  The messenger was one that I had
known in the village at home, in England.  He had left home to make his
fortune, and I had not heard of him for a long time.  They used to call
me his sweetheart.  When I saw him I cried out, and he caught my hands
in his....  After that we met whenever we could, on Sundays, on
Instruction days, whenever chance offered.  He had tried to run away
twice before we met, but he never tried afterwards. His master was a
hard man—mine was worse ... After a while we began to meet in secret—at
night ... You are a lady—that is different—you cannot understand; but I
loved him, loved him as well as any lady in the land could love; better,
maybe ... There came a night when I was followed, and taken, and he with
me.""  She broke off to smell at the scentless spear of golden-rod which
the child held up, and to say, ""Yes, my darling, pretty, pretty,
pretty,"" then went on with her eyes following the figures walking up and
down beside the stream.  ""The next night found us in the sheriff’s
hands, in the gaol at the courthouse.  Oh that blank, dreadful, heavy
night! I felt the lash already—I did not mind that—but I saw the
platform and the post, and the gaping crowd beneath.  I thought of him,
and my heart was sick; I thought of my mother, and my tears fell like
rain.... There was a noise at the window, and I stood upon my stool to
see what it was.  It was he!  He had a knife and he worked and wrenched
at the bars until he had wrenched them away, then dragged me through the
window and we stood together beneath the stars—free!  Another moment and
we were down at the water side and into a boat which was fastened there.
We loosed it and rowed with all our speed up the river.  He had killed
the gaoler and gotten away, bringing with him a musket and an axe.  All
that night we rowed, and when morning broke we were well-nigh past the
settlements, for we had been far up river to begin with.  That day we
hid in the reeds, but when night came we sped up the stream.  We came to
the falls of the far west and left our boat there.  For many days we
walked through the woods, hurrying on, day after day, for when we lay
down at night, I saw in my dreams the flash of the torches and heard the
baying of the hounds.  After a long while we came to an Indian village
not many leagues from here, and there we found the mercies of the savage
kinder than the mercies of the white man.  They may have thought us
mad—I do not know—but they did not harm us.  There we dwelt for a time,
in the stranger’s wigwam, and there the child was born.""  She pressed
the little hand which she held, and which she had never ceased to beat
against her bosom, to her lips.  ""He would have stayed in the village,
but in sleep I still heard the bloodhounds, and we left the friendly
Indians and pressed on.  We came upon this knoll on just such an evening
as this—the light in the west, and the stream very still, with a large
white star shining down upon it.  We lay down beside it, and that night
I slept without a dream....  We have been here ever since, and here we
shall stay until we die.""

""It is fair now,"" said Patricia, ""but in a little while it will be
winter and very cold.""

""Bitterly cold,"" said the woman.  ""The snow lies long in these hills,
and the wind howls down the ravine.""

""And the wolves are bold in winter.""

""Very bold.  This scar upon my arm is from the teeth of one which I
fought here, on the very threshold.""

""The Indians threaten always, summer or winter.""

""Ay, sooner or later they will come against us. We shall die that way at
last.  But what does it matter—so that we die together?""

The lady of the manor turned her pure, pale face upon the other with
wonder, and yet with comprehension, written upon it.

""You are happy!"" she said, almost in a whisper.

""Yes, I am happy,"" the woman answered, a light that was not from the
faintly crimson west upon her face.




                            *CHAPTER XXXII*

                                *ATTACK*


About midnight, Landless, lying upon the dirt floor of the lean-to
attached to the one room of the cabin, felt a hand upon his shoulder and
opened his eyes upon a shadowy figure, blocking up the starlight that
came faintly in at the open door.

""Hist!"" said the figure.  ""Ricahecrians!""

Landless sprang to his feet.  ""My God!  You are sure?""

""They are coming out of the ravine.  You will hear the whoop directly.""

The owner of the hut, stirred by the Susquehannock’s foot, started up.
Such an alarm being about the least surprising thing that could happen,
he kept his wits, and after the first intake of the breath and
exclamation of, ""Indians!"" he went about his preparations coolly enough.
Rushing into the cabin where Landless had already waked the women, he
groped for his tinder box, and with a steady hand struck a light and
fired a pine knot which he stuck into a block of wood pierced to receive
it; then jerked from the wall his musket and powder horn.

""You both have guns,"" he said coolly.  ""Good! We ’ll die fighting.""  The
woman had flown to the door, had seen that the heavy wooden bars were
drawn across it, and now stood beside him with a resolute face, and an
axe in her hands.

A moment of silence, and then the quiet night was cleft by the war
whoop—dreadful sound, forerunner of death and torture, concentrating in
its savage cadence all ideas of terror!  A moment more, and there came
the sound of many moccasined feet and the hurling of many bodies against
the door.  The door held, and the man put the muzzle of his gun in one
of the cracks between the logs and fired. The explosion was followed by
a yell.  Shot and cry preluded pandemonium.  Without were demoniacal
cries, quick crashing blows against the door, stealthy feet, clambering
forms; within were smoke and the noise of the muskets, the crying of the
child, and a red and flickering light which now brought out each detail
of the rude interior, now plunged all into shadow.

""We are making it hot for them,"" cried the owner of the hut, reloading
his musket.  ""There ’s some shall go to hell before we do.  Joan, my
girl—""

An arrow, whistling through a crack, pierced his brain and he fell to
the ground with a crash.  The shriek that the woman set up was answered
from without by a triumphant yell, and then one voice was heard
speaking.

""It is the mulatto!"" cried Patricia, clasping her hands.

""Yes,"" answered Landless grimly.  ""I thought I had done for that devil,
but it seems not.  May I have better luck this time!""

""Ugh!"" said the Indian, and pointed to the roof, which was low and
thatched with dried grass and moss.

""I see,"" said Landless.  ""The cabin is on fire. We must leave it in five
minutes, come what may.""

""We will never leave it alive,"" the Indian said calmly.  ""The dogs have
us fast.  The Chief of the Conestogas will die in a strange land; his
bones will be a plaything for the wolves of the mountains; his scalp
will hang before the wigwam of an Algonquin dog.  He will never see the
village and the pleasant river, never will he smoke the peace pipe, he
and his braves, with the Wyandots and the Lenni Lenape, sitting beneath
the mulberries in front of the lodge. He will never see the cornfeast.
He will never dance the war dance again, nor will he lead the war party.
The sagamore dies, and who will tell his tribe?  He falls like a leaf in
the forest, like a pebble that is cast into the water.  The leaf is not
seen: the stream closes above the pebble—it is gone!""  His voice rose
into a chant, stern and mournful, and his vast form appeared to expand,
to become taller.  He threw down his gun and drew his long, bright
knife.

""They are upon us!"" cried Landless, and thrust Patricia behind him.

The rude door, constructed of the trunks of saplings, bound together
with withes, crashed inwards, coming to the floor with a tremendous
noise, and a dozen savages precipitated themselves into the cabin.
Landless fired, bringing one to his knee; then clubbed his musket and
swung it over his shoulder.  Between him and the Susquehannock, standing
beside him with bent body and knife drawn back against his breast, and
the invaders, was a space some few feet in width, and in this space
something dreadful now happened.

On one side lay the body of the man with the woman crouched above it, on
the other a pile of skins upon which lay the little child.  It had
sobbed itself into exhaustion and quiet, but terrified afresh by the
savage forms pouring through the doorway, the increased and awful
clamor, the flames which had now seized upon the walls, and the choking
smoke which filled the hut, it now scrambled from the pallet, and with a
weak cry started across the space towards its mother.  It crossed the
path of the Ricahecrian chief—he glanced downwards, saw the tiny
tottering figure with its outstretched arms, caught it up, and holding
it by its feet, dashed its head against the ground.  The cry which the
child uttered as he raised it reached the until then deaf ears of the
mother.  She started up with a shriek that rang high above the yelling
of the savages, and darted forward, only to receive at her very feet the
mangled form of the baby she had sung to sleep but a few hours before.
She caught it to her breast and with another dreadful cry rushed upon
the savage.  He met her, seized her free arm, raised it, and plunged his
knife into her bosom.  Still clasping the child to her bosom, she fell
without a groan, while the Indian bounded on towards the three who yet
remained alive.

The Susquehannock met him.  ""A chief for a chief,"" he said with a cold
smile, and the two locked together in a deadly embrace.  When the
Ricahecrian was dead, the Susquehannock turned to find Landless—one
Indian dead before him, another writhing away like a wounded
snake—confronting across the body at his feet the graceful figure and
the amber-hued, evil, smiling face of Luiz Sebastian.  So strong were
the flames by now, and so dense and stifling the smoke, that of the
score or more who had broken into the cabin but few remained within its
walls, which were fast becoming those of a furnace, the majority
retreating to the fresh air outside, whence they whooped on to their
devil’s work the bolder spirits within.

These now bore down _en masse_ upon the devoted three.  One threw his
tomahawk; it whistled within half an inch of Landless’s head, and stuck
into the wall behind him.  Another struck at him with his knife, but he
beat him down with his musket, and turned again to the mulatto, who,
knife in hand, watched his chance to run in upon him.

""Look to the yellow slave, my brother,"" cried the Susquehannock, ""I will
care for these dogs,"" and hurled his gigantic form upon them.  One went
down before his knife; he broke the back of another, bending him like a
reed across his knee; a third fell, cleft to the brain by his
tomahawk—there was a fresh influx from without, and he was borne down
and knives thrust into him.  Struggling to his feet, with one last
superhuman exertion of his vast strength, he shook them off as a stag
shakes off the dogs, and stretching out his arm, cried to Landless,
dimly seen through the ever thickening smoke;—

""My brother, farewell!  I said we should find Death in the Blue
Mountains....  The Iroquois laughs at the Algonquin dogs, laughs at
Death—dies laughing.""

He broke into wild, unearthly, choking laughter, his figure swaying to
and fro like a pine in a storm.  The laughter, an indescribable and most
dreadful sound, became low, choked, a mere rattle in the throat, died
into silence, and the laugher crashed to the ground like a pine for
which the storm has been too much.

Landless drew a breath that was like a moan, but kept his eyes upon the
yellow menace before him.

""The Ricahecrians are my good friends,"" said Luiz Sebastian.  ""They
promise me a wigwam in their village in the Blue Mountains.  I shall
lead to it a bride, and she shall be no Indian girl.""

Landless struck at him over the dead body between them, but the mulatto,
springing back, avoided the blow.

""It is my hour,"" he said, still with a smile.

A portion of the roof fell in, making a barrier of flame between them.
A volume of smoke arose, and through it Landless and Patricia dimly saw
Indians and mulatto making for the doorway, driven forth by the
intolerable heat and the imminent danger of the burning walls and the
remainder of the roof caving in upon them.  Beyond Landless was the
square opening leading into the tiny shed in which he had been sleeping
when this midnight visitation came upon them. Raising Patricia in his
arms, he made for it, and they presently found themselves in temporary
security.  It was but for a moment, he knew, for the flames were already
taking hold upon the shed, but as he set his burden down he whispered
encouraging words.

""I know,"" she answered.  ""We are in God’s hands. I would rather die than
to come into that man’s power. But the door to the shed is open and the
way seems clear.  Could we not escape even now?""

""Alas! madam, the flames make it as light as day around the cabin.  They
would certainly see us.  And yet if we stay, we burn.  When the fire
reaches this straw above our heads we will try it.

""I would rather stay here,"" said Patricia.

Behind them the flames roared and crackled, the cabin burning like a
torch, and with the flames rose and fell the triumphant cries of the
savages, who, unaware of the existence of the tiny shed, so covered with
the vines that draped the cabin that it seemed one with it, congregated
in front of the gap in the wall where had been the door, and waited for
their still living victims to emerge from it.

""Look!"" breathed Patricia, grasping Landless’s arm.

They stood facing the open door of the shed, and gazing through it down
the lit slope of the knoll. Into the light, out of the darkness at the
foot of the hill, now glided a man, naked save for the loin cloth, and
painted with horrible devices; in the figure, noiseless and bent
forward, savage cunning; in the eyes, the lust for blood.  In his
footsteps came his double, then a third, in all points exactly similar,
then a fourth, a fifth—a long line, creeping as silently as shadows—a
nightmare procession—up through the lurid light.

Landless drew Patricia further into the shadow.

""Wait,"" he said.  ""They may prove our deliverance.""

The stealthy line reached the summit of the knoll, then broadened into a
disc, and swept past the frail shelter in which stood the fugitives.  A
moment, and the war whoop rang out, to be answered by a burst of yells
from the Ricahecrians, and then by prolonged and awful clamor.

""Now is our time,"" said Landless.

Hand in hand they ran from the shed that was now in a light flame, and
down the slope up which had come the band of unconscious Samaritans.

""The stream!"" said Landless.  ""There is a small raft upon it if they
have not destroyed it.""

They made for the water, found the raft hidden in a clump of reeds and
uninjured, and stepped upon it. In ten minutes’ time from the appearance
of the new factor in the sum they were moving steadily, if slowly, down
a stream so wide that in Europe it would have been called a river.  The
glare from the burning cabin faded, the flaming mass itself shrunk until
it looked a burning bush, then dwindled to a star.  The noise of the
struggle upon the mount was with them longer, but at length it, too,
died away.

""Which will conquer?"" said Patricia at last, from where she crouched at
the feet of Landless, who stood erect, poling.

""The Ricahecrians were the stronger,"" he answered. ""But they may be so
handled that they will not come at us again.  That must be our hope.""

There followed a long silence, broken by Patricia.

""The baby,"" she said in a quivering voice, ""the poor, pretty, innocent
little thing!""

""It is well with it,"" said Landless.  ""It is spared all toil and
suffering.  It is better as it is.""

""The man and woman went together,"" said Patricia, still with the sob in
her voice.  ""They would have chosen it so, I think.  But the poor
Indian—""

""He was my friend,"" said Landless slowly, ""and I brought him death.""

""It is I that brought him death!"" cried Patricia, tossing up her arms.
""I that shall bring you death!""

Her voice rose into a cry that echoed drearily from the hills about
them, and she beat her hands against the raft with a sudden passion.

""You would bring me no unwelcome gift,"" said Landless steadily,
""provided only that the time when I could serve you with my life were
past.""

She did not answer, and they floated on in silence down the little
river, between banks lined with dwarf willows and sighing reeds.  With
the dawn they came to rapids through which they could not pilot their
frail craft.  Leaving the water, they turned their faces towards the
rising sun, and pursued their journey through the forest that seemed to
stretch to the end of the world.




                            *CHAPTER XXXIII*

                         *THE FALL OF THE LEAF*


Days passed, and the forest put on a beauty, austere, yet fantastic,
bizarre.  Above it hung a pale blue sky; within it, a perpetual, pale
blue haze, through which blazed the scarlet and gold of the trees—great
bonfires which did not warm, flaming pyres which were never consumed.
Morning and evening a shroud of chill, white mist fell upon them, or
they would have mocked the sunrise and the sunset.  Along the summit of
low hills ran a comb of fire—the scarlet of the sumach, leaf and berry;
underfoot were crimson vines like trails and splashes of blood; into the
streams from which the wanderers stooped to drink, fell the gold of the
sycamore.  From the hills they looked down upon a red and yellow world,
a gorgeous bourgeoning and blossoming that put the spring to shame, a
sea of splendor with here and there a dark-green isle of cedar or of
pine.  Day after day saw the same calm blue sky, the same blue haze, the
same slow drifting of crimson and gold to earth.  The winds did not
blow, and the murmur of the forest was hushed.  All sound seemed muffled
and remote.  The deer passed noiseless down the long aisles, the beaver
and the otter slipped noiseless into the stream, the bear rolled its
shambling bulk away from human neighborhood like a shapeless shadow.  At
times vast flocks of wild pigeons darkened the air, but they passed like
a cloud. The singing birds were gone.  Only at night did sound awake,
for then the wolves howled, and the infrequent scream of the panther
chilled the blood, and the fires which the wanderers must needs build
roared and crackled through the darkness.  In the daytime beauty, vast
and melancholy; in the night, shadows and mysteries, the voice of wild
beasts and the stillness of the stars; at all times an enemy, they knew
not how far away or how near at hand, behind them.

Through this world which seemed more a phantasm than a reality, Landless
and Patricia fared, and were happy.  All passion, all fear, all mistrust
and anger slept in that enchanted calm.  They never spoke of the past,
they had well-nigh ceased to think of it. When they knelt upon the turf
beside some crystal brook, and drank of the water which seemed red wine
or molten gold according to the nature of the trees above it, it might
have been the water of Lethe.

In the illimitable forest, too, in the monotony of sunshine and shade,
of glade and dell, of crystal streams and tiny valleys, each the
counterpart of the other, in dense woods and grassy savannahs; in the
yesterday so like to-day, and the to-day so like to-morrow, there was no
hint of the future.  It was enchanted ground, where to-morrow must
always be like to-day.  They kept their faces to the east, and they
walked each day as many leagues as her strength would permit, and
Landless, imitating as best he could the dead Susquehannock, took all
precautions to cover their trail; but that done all was done, and they
put care behind them.  Landless, walking in a dream, knew that it was a
dream, and said to himself, ""I must awaken, but not yet.  I will dream
and be happy yet a little while.""  But Patricia dreamt and knew it not.
She kept her wonted state, or, rather, with a quiet insistence he kept
it for her.  He never addressed her save as ""Madam,"" and he cared for
her comfort, and in all things bore himself towards her with the formal
courtesy he would have shown a queen.  He said to himself, ""Godfrey
Landless, Godfrey Landless, thou mayst forget much, perhaps, for a
little while; but not this!  If thou dost, thou art no honorable man.""

Master of himself, he walked beside her, cared for her, tended her,
guarded her, served her as if he had been a knight-errant out of a
romance, and she a distressed princess.  And she rewarded him with a
delicate kindliness, and a perfectly trustful, childlike dependence upon
his strength, wisdom, and resource. All her bearing towards him was
marked by an inexpressible charm, half-playful, wholly gracious and
womanly.  The lady of the manor was gone, and in her place moved the
Patricia Verney of the enchanted forest—a very different creature.

Thus they fared through the dying summer, and were happy in the present
of soft sunshine, tender haze, fantastic beauty.  Sometimes they walked
in silence, too truly companions to feel the need of words; at other
times they talked, and the hours flew past, for they both had wit,
intelligence, quick fancy, high imagination.  Sometimes their laughter
rang through the glades of the forest, and set the squirrels in the oaks
to chattering; sometimes in the melancholy grace of the evening when the
purple twilight sank through the trees, and the large stars came out one
by one, they spoke of grave things, of the mysteries of life and death,
of the soul and its hereafter.  She had early noticed that he never lay
down at night without having first silently prayed.  There had been a
time when she would have laughed at this as Puritan hypocrisy, but now,
one dark night, when the noises of the forest were loud about them, and
the wind rushed through the trees, she came close to him and knelt
beside him.  Thenceforward each night, before they lay down beside their
fire, and when from out the darkness came all weird and mournful sounds,
when the owl hooted, and the catamount screamed, and the long howl of
the wolf was answered by its fellow, he stood with bared head, and in a
few short, simple words commended them both to God.  ""I will both lay me
down in peace and sleep, for Thou, Lord, only makest me to dwell in
safety.""

There came a day when they sat down to rest upon the dark, smooth ground
in a belt of pines, and looked between rows of stately columns to where,
in the distance, the arcade was closed by a broken and confused glory of
crimson oak and yellow maple.  Landless told her that it was like gazing
at a rose window down the long nave of a cathedral.

""I have never seen a cathedral,"" she said; ""I have dreamed of them,
though, of your Milton’s ’dim religious light,’ and of the rolling
music.""

""I have seen many,"" he answered.  ""But none of them are to me what the
abbey at Westminster is.  If you should ever see it—""

Something in her face stopped him: there was a silence, and then he said
quietly:—

""When you shall see it, is perhaps better, madam?""

""Yes,"" she answered, gazing before her with wide fixed eyes.

He did not finish his sentence, and neither spoke again until they had
left the pines and were forcing their way through the tall grass and
reeds of a wide savannah.  They came to a small, clear stream, dotted
with wild fowl and mirroring the pale blue sky, and he lifted her in his
arms as was his wont and bore her through the shallow water.  As he set
her gently down upon the other side, she said in a low voice, ""I thought
you knew.  Had it not been for that night, that night which sets us
here, you and I,—I should be now in London, at Whitehall, at some masque
or pageant perhaps.  I should be all clad in brocade and jewels, not
like this—""  She touched her ragged gown as she spoke, then burst into
strange laughter. ""But God disposes!  And you—""

""I should be in a place which is never mentioned at Court, madam,"" said
Landless grimly.  ""The grave, to wit.  Unless indeed his Excellency
proposed hanging me in chains.""

She cried out as though she had been struck. ""Don’t!"" she said
passionately.  ""Don’t speak to me so!  I will not bear it!"" and ran past
him into the woods beyond the savannah.

When he came up with her he found her lying on a mossy bank with her
face hidden.

""Madam,"" he said, kneeling beside her, ""forgive me.""

She lifted a colorless face from her hands.  ""How far are we from the
Settlements?"" she demanded.

""I do not know, madam.  Some twenty leagues, probably, from the frontier
posts.""

""How far from the friendly tribes?""

""Something less than that distance.""

""Then when we reach them, sir,"" she said imperiously, ""you are to leave
me with them at one of the villages above the falls.""

""To leave you there!""

""Yes.  You will tell them that I am the daughter of one of the paleface
chiefs, of one whom the great white chief calls ’brother,’ and then they
will not dare to harm me or to detain me.  They will send me down the
river to the nearest post, and the men there will bring me on to
Jamestown, and so home.""

""And why may not I bring you on to Jamestown—and so home?"" demanded
Landless with a smile.

""Because—because—you know that you are lost if you return to the
Settlements.""

""And nevertheless I shall return,"" he said with another smile.

She struck her hands together.  ""You will be mad—mad! If you had not
been their leader!—but as it is, there is no hope.  Leave me with the
friendly Indians, then go yourself to the northward.  Make for New
Amsterdam.  God will carry you through the Indians as he has done so
far.  I will pray to him that he do so.  Ah, promise me that you will
go!""

Landless took her hand and kissed it.  ""Were you in absolute safety,
madam,"" he said gently, ""and if it were not for one other thing, I would
go, because you wish it, and because I would save you any pang, however
slight, that you might feel for the fate of one who was, who is, your
servant—your slave.  I would go from you, and because it else might
grieve you, I would strive to keep my life through the forest, through
the winter—""

""Ah, the winter!"" she cried.  ""I had forgotten that winter will come.""

""But to do that which you propose,"" he continued, ""to leave you to the
mercy of fierce and treacherous Indians, but half subdued, friends to
the whites only because they must—it is out of the question.  To leave
you at a frontier post among rude trappers and traders, or at some half
savage pioneer’s, is equally impossible.  What tale would you have to
tell Colonel Verney?  ’The Ricahecrians carried me into the Blue
Mountains.  There your servant Landless found me and brought me a long
distance towards my home.  But at the last, to save his own neck,
forfeit to the State, he left me, still in the wilderness and in danger,
and went his way.’  My honor, madam, is my own, and I choose not to so
stain it.  Again: I must be the witness to your story. You have wandered
for many weeks in a wilderness, far beyond the ken of your friends.  To
your world, madam, I am a rebel, traitor and convict, a wretch capable
of any baseness, of any crime.  If I go back with you, throwing myself
into the power of Governor and Council, at least I shall be credited
with having so borne myself towards my master’s daughter as to fear
nothing from their hands on that score.  The idle and censorious cannot
choose but believe when you say, ’I am come scatheless through weeks of
daily and hourly companionship with this man. Rebel, and traitor, and
gaol-bird, though he be, he never injured me in word, thought, or deed.’
... For all these reasons, madam, we must be companions still.""

She had covered her face while he was speaking, and she kept it hidden
when he had finished.  The slowly lengthening shadows of the trees had
barred the little glade with black when he spoke again.  It was only to
ask in his usual voice if she were rested and ready to continue their
journey.

She raised her head and looked at him with swimming eyes, then held out
two trembling hands.  He took them, helped her to her feet, and before
releasing them, bent and touched them with his lips.  Then side by side
and in silence they traveled on through the halcyon calm of the world
around them.




                            *CHAPTER XXXIV*

                             *AN ACCIDENT*


It was early morning, and the mist lay heavy upon the forest and on the
bosom of the James.  Landless and Patricia raked together the dying
embers of their fire and heaped fresh wood upon them.  The flames leaped
up, warming their chilled bodies and filling the hollow that had been
their camping place with a cheerful light, in which the moisture that
clothed tree bole and fallen log and withered fern glistened like
diamonds.  Their breakfast of deer meat and broiled fish, nuts and a few
late clusters of grape, with coldest water from a spring hard by, was
eaten amidst laughter and pleasant talk.  When they had lingered through
it and when Landless had carefully extinguished their fire and had seen
to the priming of his gun, they addressed themselves to their journey.

A bowshot away was the river, and Patricia willed that they walk along
its banks that they might see the white mist lift, and the silver flash
of fish rising from the water, and the swoop of the kingfisher. Landless
agreeing, they went down to the river, and standing upon a rocky spit of
ground which ran far out into the stream, they looked down the misty
expanse, then turned involuntarily and looked up.  At that moment the
fog lifted.

""Ah!"" cried Patricia, and shrunk back, cowering almost to the ground.

Landless seized her in his arms and ran with her across the shingle and
up the bank.  Plunging into the woods he made for the little stream
which flowed past their camping place, and entering the water, walked
rapidly up it.

""Did they see us?"" Patricia asked in a low, strained voice.

""I am afraid so.""

""They turned their boats towards the land.  They are in the forest by
now.""

""Yes.""

""And there is no doubt that they are the same.  I saw the scarlet
handkerchief upon the head of the mulatto.""

""Yes, they are the same.""

""They were such a little way from us.  Oh, they may be upon us at any
moment!""

""We are in great danger,"" he answered gravely, ""but it is not so
imminent as that.  They were nearly a mile above us, and they have to
land, to hide their boats and to find our trail, all of which will take
time.  We may count on having an hour’s start of them, and we will do
all in our power to increase it by breaking our trail as we are doing
now.  Then we cannot be many leagues from the falls, and the post below
them, or we may stumble at any moment upon some Monacan village which
will not need our urging to fly out against the Ricahecrians.  Please
God, we will win through them yet.""

Somewhat comforted, she lay within his arms without speaking until they
left the stream, when he set her down, and giving her his hand, ran with
her over the fallen leaves down the long aisles of the forest.

Red gold showers fell upon them; fiery vines clutched at their feet, or,
swinging from the trees, struck at their faces with vicious tendrils;
the pines made the ground beneath like ice; rotting logs covered with
gorgeous fungi barred their way; dark and poisonous swamps appeared
before them, and had to be skirted—the forest leagued itself with its
children and did them yeoman service.

The two aliens hastened breathlessly on.  The sun climbed above the tree
tops and looked down upon them through the half denuded branches.
Midday came, and the short bright afternoon, and still they went fast
through the woods, and still they heard no other sound than the rustle
and sough of the leaves and the beating of their own hearts.  They came
to rising ground, and mounting it, found themselves upon a chinquepin
ridge, and before them an abrupt descent of rain-washed, boulder-strewn
earth.  It was so nearly a precipice that Patricia shrunk back with an
exclamation of dismay.

""I will go first,"" said Landless.  ""Give me your hands.  So!""

Half way down, the earth began to slip.  Patricia, looking up and over
her shoulder, uttered a cry.  A great boulder, imbedded in the earth
directly above them, was dislodging itself, was falling!  At her cry
Landless raised his eyes, saw the threatening mass, caught her around
the waist, and with one supreme effort swung her out of the path of the
avalanche which descended the next moment, bearing him with it to the
ground beneath.

He was recalled to consciousness by the dash of water against his face,
and opened his eyes to behold Patricia bending over him, very white,
with tragic eyes, and lips pressed closely together.  She had run to the
river, flowing through the sunshine a hundred yards away, for water,
which she had brought back in his cap, and she had taken the kerchief
from her neck, wet it, and laid it upon his forehead.  Her hands were
torn and bleeding, he saw them and uttered an exclamation.  ""It is
nothing,"" she said; ""I had to move the rock.""  Scarcely fully conscious
as yet, his eyes glanced from her to the great rock which lay upon one
side, and upon which there were bloodstains.  ""I have had a bad fall,""
he said unsteadily, but with an attempt to speak lightly because of the
trouble in her eyes, ""but it is over. Come! we must hurry on.  We have
no time to lose.""

As he spoke he strove to rise, but with the effort came a pang of
anguish, and he sank back, faint and sick, upon the ground.

""Ah! you cannot!"" cried Patricia with a great sob in her voice.  ""It is
your foot.  The rock fell upon it.""

After a moment of lying with closed eyes, he sat up and with his knife
began to cut away the moccasin from the wounded limb.  Presently he
looked up. ""Yes, it is badly crushed.  There is no doing anything with
it.""

For many moments they gazed at each other in a despairing silence,
broken by Patricia’s low, ""What are we to do now?""

""We must go on,"" answered Landless.  ""It is death to stay here.""

Holding by the bank against which he had leaned, he dragged himself up
and stood for an instant with eyes dark with pain; then, setting his
lips, took a step forward.  The bronze of his face paled, and beads of
anguish stood upon his brow, but he took another step.  Patricia, the
tears running down her cheeks, came to him and put his arm around her
shoulder. ""I will be your crutch,"" she said, striving to smile. ""I will
carry the gun, too.""

Before them was a steeply sloping, grass-grown ascent rising to a broken
line of cliffs, scarred and gray, crowned with cedars and hung here and
there with crimson creepers, and with a chance medley of huge gray
boulders scattered about their base.  Up this ascent they labored, so
slowly that the crags seemed like the mountain in the Arabian tale, ever
receding as they advanced.  Twice Landless staggered and fell to his
knee, but when, after what seemed an eternity of pain and distress, they
reached the summit and Patricia would have had him rest, he shook his
head and motioned with his hand towards the narrow, boulder-strewn
plateau at the foot of the crags.

With her accustomed unquestioning obedience she turned towards the
rocks, and after another interval of painful toil they found themselves
in a sort of rocky chamber, a natural blockhouse, of which the sheer
cliff formed one wall and boulders of varying height and shape the
others.

Above them gleamed the blue sky; through the gaps between the rocks they
looked down upon the shining river and the parti-colored woods, and
behind them towered the cliffs.  A strong wind was blowing and it sent
red leaves from the vines that draped the rock whirling down upon them.

""The tall gray crags,"" said Patricia in a strange voice, ""and the
Martinmas wind.  The river flowing in the sunshine too.""

Landless sank upon the rocky floor.  ""I can go no further,"" he said.
""God help me!""

""I do not think another man could have come so far,"" she answered.
""What are we to do now?""

""You must go on without me.""

She cried out angrily, ""What do you mean?  I don’t understand you.""

""Listen,"" he said earnestly, dragging himself closer to her.  ""We can be
but a very few leagues from the falls, still fewer from the Indian
villages above them. Reach one of those villages and you are safe from
these devils at least.  We have kept the start of them.  They may not
reach this spot for several hours, and when they come, I will keep them
here, God helping me, for more hours than one.  This place is a natural
fortress, and they have no guns.  They will not take me until my
ammunition is exhausted, and you know there is store of bullets and
powder.  They will think that you are with me, hidden behind the rocks—""

""And I shall be with you!"" she cried vehemently.

""No, no.  You must go through this pass in the cliff to the right of us,
and thence down the river with all your speed.  Please God, to-morrow
will find you in safety.  It is the only way.  To stay here is to fall
into their hands.  And you must not delay.  You must go at once.""

""And you—"" she said in a whisper.

""What does it matter if I lose my life to-day instead of a few weeks
hence?  I grieve for this,"" with a glance at his foot, ""because it keeps
me from being with you, from guarding you into perfect safety. Otherwise
it does not matter.  You lose time, madam.""

She stood with heaving bosom and foot tapping the ground, an expression
that he could not read in her wonderful eyes.  ""I am not going,"" she
said at last.




                             *CHAPTER XXXV*

                        *THE BOAT THAT WAS NOT*


""You will not go!"" cried Landless.

""No, I will not!"" she answered passionately. ""Why should you think such
a thing of me?  See! we have been together, you and I, for long weeks!
You have been my faithful guide, my faithful protector.  Over and over
again you have saved my life. And now, now when you are the helpless
one, when it is through me that you lie there helpless, when it is
through me that you are in this dreadful forest at all, you tell me to
go! to leave you to the fate I have brought upon you! to save myself!  I
will not save myself!  But the other day it was dishonor in you to leave
me below the falls—almost in safety.  Mine the dishonor if I do what you
bid me do!""

""Madam, madam, it is not with women as with men!""

""I care not for women!  I care for myself. Never, never, will I leave,
helpless and wounded, the man who dies for me!""

""Upon my knees I implore you!"" Landless cried in desperation.  ""You
cannot save me, you cannot help me.  It is you that would make the
bitterness of my fate.  Let me die believing that you have escaped these
fiends, and then, do what they will to me, I shall die happy, blessing
with my last breath the generous woman who lets me give—how proudly and
gladly she will never know—my worthless life in exchange for hers, so
young, bright, innocent.  Go, go, before it is too late!""

He dragged himself a foot nearer, and grasping the hem of her dress,
pressed it to his lips.  ""Good-bye,"" he said with a faint smile.  ""Keep
behind the rocks for some distance, then follow the river.  Think kindly
of me.  Good-bye.""

""It is too late,"" she said.  ""I can see the river through this crack
between the rocks.  One of those two canoes has just passed, going down
the river.  In it were seven Ricahecrians and the mulatto.  I saw him
quite plainly, for they row close to the bank with their faces turned to
the woods.  They will land at some point below this and search for our
trail.  When they do not find it, they will know that we are between
them and the rest of the band, and they will come upon us from behind.
If I go now, it will be to meet them.  Shall I go?""

""No, no,"" groaned Landless.  ""It is too late. God help you!  I cannot.""

The large tears gathered in her eyes and fell over her white cheeks.
""Oh, why,"" she said plaintively, ""why did He let you hurt yourself just
now?""  She turned her face to the rock against which she was standing,
and hiding it in her arm, broke into a low sobbing.  It went to the
heart of the man at her feet to hear her.

Presently the weeping ceased.  She drew a long tremulous sigh, and
dashed the tears from her eyes. Her hands went up to her disheveled hair
in a little involuntary, feminine gesture, and she looked at him with a
wan smile.

""I did not mean to be so cowardly,"" she said simply.  ""I will be brave
now.""

""You are the bravest woman in the world,"" he answered.

Below them waved the painted forest flaunting triumphant banners of
crimson and gold.  A strong south wind was blowing, and it brought to
them a sound as of the whispering of many voices.  The shining river,
too, murmured to its reeds and pebbles, and in the air was the dull
whirr of wings as the vast flocks of wild fowl rose like dark smoke from
the water, or, skimming along its surface, broke it into myriad diamond
sprays.  Around the horizon towered heaped-up masses of cloud—Ossa piled
on Pelion—fantastic Jack-and-the-Beanstalk castles, built high above the
world, with rampart and turret and bastion of pearl and coral.  Above
rose the sky intensely blue and calm.

All the wealth, the warmth and loveliness of the world they were about
to leave flowed over the souls of the doomed pair.  In their hearts they
each said farewell to it forever.  Patricia stood with uplifted face and
clear eyes, looking deep into the azure heaven.  ""I am trying to think,""
she said, ""that death is not so bitter after all.  To-day is
beautiful—but ours will be a fairer morrow!  After to-day we will never
be tired, or fear, or be in danger any more. I am not afraid to die; but
ah! if it could only come to us now, swiftly, silently, out of the blue
yonder; if we could go without the blood—the horror—"" she broke off
shuddering.  Her eyes closed and she rested her head against the rock.
Landless watched the beautiful, pale face, the quivering eyelids, the
coral underlip drawn between the pearly teeth, in a passion of pity and
despair.  Horrid visions of torture flashed through his brain; he saw
the delicate limbs writhing, heard the agonized screams....  If he
killed the mulatto, it might come to that; if the mulatto lived, he knew
that she would kill herself.  He had given her the knife that had been
Monakatocka’s, and she had it now, hidden in her bosom....  The glory of
the autumn day darkened and went out, the bitter waters of affliction
surged over him, an immeasurable sea; it seemed to him that until then
he had never suffered.  A cold sweat broke out upon him, and with an
inarticulate cry of rage and despair he struck at his wounded foot as at
a deadly foe.  The girl cried out at the sound of the blow.

""Oh, don’t, don’t!  What are you doing?  You have loosened the bandage,
and it is bleeding afresh.""

Despite his effort to prevent her she readjusted the kerchief which she
had wound about the torn and crushed foot, very carefully and tenderly.
""It must hurt you very much,"" she said pityingly.

He took the little ministering hands in his and kissed them.  ""Oh,
madam, madam!"" he groaned. ""God knows I would shed every drop of my
blood a thousand times to save you.  Death to me is nothing, nor life so
fair that I should care to keep it.  The grave is a less dreadful prison
than those on earth, and I think to find in God a more merciful Judge.
But you—so young and beautiful, with friends, love—""

She stopped him with a gesture full of dignity and sweetness.  ""That
life is gone forever,—it is thousands of miles and ages on ages away.
It is a world more distant than the stars, and we are nearer to Heaven
than to it....  It is strange to think how we have drifted, you and I,
to this rock.  A year ago we had never seen each other’s faces, had
never heard each other’s names, and yet you were coming to this rock
from prison and over seas, and I was coming to meet you....  And it is
our death place, and we will die together, and to-morrow maybe the
little birds will cover us with leaves as they did the children in the
story.  They were brother and sister....  When our time comes I will not
be afraid, for I will be with you ... my brother.""

Landless covered his face with his hands.

The shadows grew longer and the cloud castles began to flush rosily,
though the sun still rode above the tree tops.  A purple light filled
the aisles of the forest, through which a herd of deer, making for some
accustomed lick, passed like a phantom troop.  They vanished, and from
out the stillness of the glades came the sudden, startled barking of a
fox.  A shadow darted across a sunlit alley from gloom to gloom, paused
on the outskirts of the wood below the crags while one might count ten,
then turned and flitted back into the darkness from whence it came.
They beneath the crags did not see it.

Suddenly Landless raised his head.  Upon his face was the look of one
who has come through much doubt and anguish of spirit to an immutable
resolve.  He looked to the priming of his gun and laid it upon the rock
beside him, together with his powderhorn and pouch of bullets.  Raising
himself to his knees he gazed long and intently into the forest below.
There was no sign of danger.  On the checkered ground beneath two mighty
oaks squirrels were playing together like frolicsome kittens, and
through the clear air came the tapping of a woodpecker.  The forest was
silent as to the shadow that had flitted through it.  It can keep a
secret very well.

Landless sank back against the rock.  He had lost much blood, and that
and the pain of his mangled foot turned him faint and sick for minutes
at a time. He clenched his teeth and forced back the deadly faintness,
then turned to the woman who stood beside him, her hands clasped before
her, her eyes following the declining sun, her lips sometimes set in
mournful curves, sometimes murmuring broken and inaudible words of
prayer.  He called her twice before she answered, turning to him with
eyes of feverish splendor which saw and yet saw not.  ""What is it?"" she
asked dreamily.

""Come back to earth, madam,"" he said.  ""There is that that I wish to say
to you.  Listen to me kindly and pitifully, as to a dying man.""

""I am listening,"" she answered.  ""What is it?""

""It is this, madam: I love you.  For God’s sake don’t turn away!  Oh, I
know that I should have been strong to the end, that I should not vex
you thus!  It is the coward’s part I play, perhaps, but I must speak!  I
cannot die without.  I love you, I love you, I love you!""

His voice rose into a cry; in it rang long repressed passion, hopeless
adoration, fierce joy in having broken the bonds of silence.  He spoke
rapidly, thickly, with a stammering tongue, now throwing out his hands
in passionate appeal, now crushing between his fingers the dried moss
and twigs with which the ground was strewn.  ""I loved you the day I
first saw you.  I have loved you ever since.  I love you now. My God!
how I love you!  Die for you?  I would die for you ten thousand times!
I would live for you!  Oh, the day I first saw you!  I was in hell and I
looked at you as lost Dives might have looked at the angel on the other
side of the gulf....  I never thought to tell you this.  I know that
never, never, never....  But this is the day of our death.  In a few
hours we shall be gone.  Do not leave the world in anger with me.  Say
that you pity, understand, forgive....  Speak to me, madam!""

The sun sank lower and the shadows lengthened and deepened, and still
Patricia stood silent with uplifted and averted face, and fingers
tightly locked together.  With a moan of mortal weakness Landless
dragged himself nearer until he touched with his forehead the low
pedestal of rock upon which she stood. ""I understand,"" he said quietly.
""After all, there is nothing to be said, is there?  Try to forget
my—madness.  Think of it, if you will, as the raving of one at death’s
door.  Let it be as it was between us.""

Patricia turned—her beautiful face transfigured. Roses bloomed in her
cheeks, her eyes were fathomless wells of splendor, an exquisite smile
played about her lips; with her nimbus of golden hair she looked a rapt
mediæval saint.  Her slender figure swayed towards Landless, and when
she spoke her voice was like the tone of a violin, soft, rich,
caressing, tremulous.

""There was no boat,"" she said.

""No boat!"" he cried.  ""What do you mean?""

""The canoe going down the river.  I told you that it held seven Indians
and the mulatto.  I lied to you. There were no Indians, no mulatto, no
canoe.  The shadows of the clouds have been upon the river, and the wild
fowl, and once a fish-hawk plunged.  I have seen nothing else.""

Landless gazed at her with staring eyeballs.  ""You have thrown away your
life,"" he said at last in a voice that did not seem his own.

""Yes, I have thrown away my life.""

""But why—why—""

The rich color surged over her face and neck.  She swayed towards him
with the grace of a wind-bowed lily, her breath fanning his forehead,
and her hand touching his, softly, flutteringly, like a young bird.

""Can you not guess why?"" she said with an enchanting smile.

All the anguish of a little while back, all the terror of the fate that
hung over her, all the white calm of despair was gone.  The horror that
moved nearer and nearer, moment by moment, through the painted forest,
was forgotten.  She looked at him shyly from under her long lashes and
with another wonderful blush.

Landless gazed at her, comprehension slowly dawning in his eyes.  For
five minutes there was a silence as of the dead beneath the crags.  Then
with a great cry he caught her hands in his and drew her towards him.
""Is it?"" he cried.

""Yes,"" she answered with laughter trembling on her lips.  ""Death hath
enfranchised us, you and I. Give me my betrothal kiss, my only love.""

For them one moment of Paradise, of bliss ineffable and supreme.  The
next, the crags behind them rang to the sound of the war whoop.




                            *CHAPTER XXXVI*

                            *THE LAST FIGHT*


Out from the forest rushed the remnant of that band which had smoked the
peace pipe with the Governor one sunny afternoon on the banks of the
Pamunkey.  Tall and large of limb, painted with all fantastic and
ghastly devices, and decorated with hideous mementoes of nameless deeds;
with the lust of blood written large in every fierce lineament and dark
and rolling eye; with raised hands grasping knife and tomahawk, and lips
uttering cries that seemed not of earth—a more appalling vision could
not have issued from out the beautiful, treacherous forest, a more
crashing discord have come into the music of the golden evening.

For the two in their rocky fortress beneath the crags the apparition had
no terrors.  All the pain, the anguish, the hopelessness of the world
was passing from them—the cry that swelled through the forest was its
knell.  They smiled to hear it, and with raised faces looked beyond the
many-tinted evening skies into clear spaces where Love was all.  The
intoxication of the moment when hidden and despairing love became love
triumphant and acknowledged abode with them.  In the very grasp of death
ineffable bliss possessed them.  Their countenances changed; the lines
of care and pain, the marks of tears, were all gone, and the beauty of
the happy soul shone out. For that brief space of time transcendent
youth and loveliness was theirs.  About them, as about the sun now
sinking behind the low hills, there breathed a glory, a dying splendor
as bright as it was fleeting. They felt, too, a lightness and gaiety of
spirit—they had drunk of the nectar of the gods, and no leaden weight of
care, no heavy sorrow, could ever touch them, ever drag them down again
to the sad earth.

""You are beautiful,"" said Landless, gazing at her, even in the act of
raising his gun to his shoulder; ""as beautiful as you were the day I
first saw you. I hear the drone of the bees in the vines at Verney
Manor.  I smell the roses.  I look up and see the Rose of the World.  My
eyes were dazzled then, are dazzled now, my Rose of the World.""

""That day I wore brocade and lace, and there were pearls around my
throat,"" she said with a laugh of pure delight.  ""There was rouge upon
my cheeks, too, sir, and my eyes were darkened.  To-day I go a beggar
maid, in rags, burnt by the sun—""

""The nut-brown maid,"" he said.

""Ay,"" she answered, ""the nut-brown maid—’For in my mind of all
mankind’—you may e’en finish it yourself, sir.""

The Ricahecrians had paused at the foot of the ascent to hold a council.
It was soon over.  With another burst of cries they rushed up the steep
and upon the rocks, behind which were hidden their victims.  Landless,
kneeling to one side of the gap between the boulders by which he and
Patricia had entered, fired, and the foremost of the savages threw up
his arms, uttered a dreadful cry, and fell across the path of his
fellows.  For one moment the rush was checked, the next on they came,
yelling furiously and brandishing their weapons.  Landless fired and
missed, fired again and pierced the thigh of a gigantic warrior,
bringing him crashing to the ground.  The line wavered, paused, then
turning, swept to one side and so passed out of sight.

""They have found this pass too formidable,"" said Landless.  ""They will
try now to force an entrance from the side.  Do you watch the front, my
queen, while I face them, coming over the rocks.""

""I looked only at the mulatto,"" she said.  ""The others are shadows to
me.""

""His time is come,"" said Landless.  ""Do not fear him, sweetheart.""

""I fear not,"" she answered.  ""I have the perfect love.""

Along the top of a tall boulder to their right appeared a dark red
line—the arm of a savage, with clutching fingers.  Above it, very slowly
and cautiously, there rose first an eagle’s feather, then coarse black
scalp lock, then a high forehead and fierce eyes.  The echo of
Landless’s shot reverberated through the cliffs, and when the smoke
cleared only the bare gray boulder faced him.  But from behind it came a
derisive yell.

""Thou wilt think me a poor marksman, my dear,"" he said, smiling, as he
reloaded his musket.  ""I have missed again.""

""It is because you are wounded,"" she said.  ""I would I had thy wounds.""

""I had a wounded heart, but you have healed it,"" he said, and looked at
her with shining eyes.

The sun sank and the long twilight of the hills set in.  The evening
star was brightening through the pale amethyst of the sky when Landless
said quietly: ""The last charge,"" and emptied it into an arm which for
one incautious moment had waved above the rocks.

""It is the end, then,"" said Patricia.

""Yes, it is the end.  We have beaten them back for the moment, but
presently they will find that all we could do we have done, and then—""

She left her post beside the gap in the front, and came and knelt beside
him, and he took her in his arms.

""It is not Death before us, but Life,"" she said in a low voice.

""It is God and Love, naught else,"" he answered. ""But the river between
will be bitter for you to cross, sweetheart.""

""We cross it together,"" she said, ""and so—""  She raised her head that he
might see her radiant smile, and their lips met.

""Hark!"" she said directly with her hand on his. ""What is that sound?""

He shook his head.  ""The wind has risen, and the forest rustles and
sighs.  There is nothing more.""

""It is far off,"" she answered, ""but it is like the dip of oars.  Ah!""

Over against them, framed in the narrow opening between the rocks, his
lithe, half-nude figure dark against the crimson west, and with a smile
upon his evil lips and in his evil eyes, stood Luiz Sebastian. In the
dead silence that succeeded he looked with a smiling countenance from
the musket, now useless and thrown aside, to his enemy, wounded and
unarmed save for a knife, and to the woman in that enemy’s arms; then,
without turning, he said a few words in an Indian tongue.  From the
dusky mass behind him came one short, wild cry of savage triumph,
followed by another dead silence.

Still holding Patricia in one arm, Landless rose from his knee, and
stood confronting him.

""We are met again, Señor Landless,"" said Luiz Sebastian smoothly.
Receiving no answer, he spoke again with a tigerish expansion of his
thick lips. ""You have had an accident, I see.  Mother of God! that foot
must pain you!  But you will forget it presently in the pleasure of the
pine splinters.""

""I will forget it in the pleasure of this,"" said Landless, releasing
Patricia, and springing upon the mulatto with a suddenness and violence
that sent them both staggering through the opening between the rocks,
out upon the narrow plateau and into the ring of Ricahecrians.  Luiz
Sebastian was strong, with the easy masked strength of the panther, but
Landless had the strength of despair.  The mulatto, thrown heavily to
the ground, and pinned there by his adversary’s knee, saw the gleam of
the lifted knife, and would have seen nothing more in this life, but
that a woman’s cry rang out and saved him.  Landless heard, turned, saw
Patricia dragged from the shelter of the rocks, leaped to his feet,
leaving his work undone, and rushed upon the knot of savages with whom
she was struggling.  A moment saw him beside her with the Indian who had
held her dead at his feet.  Behind them was the great boulder which had
formed the front wall of their chamber of defense.  He put his arm
around her, and drew her back with him until they stood against this
rock, then faced the advancing savages with uplifted knife.

So determined was his attitude, so terribly had they proved his power,
so certain it was that before he should be taken one at least of their
number would taste that knife, that the Ricahecrians paused, swaying to
and fro, yelling, working themselves into a fury that should send them
on like maddened brutes, blind and deaf to all things but their lust for
blood.

""I hear a sound of footsteps over the leaves,"" said Patricia.

""The wind rustles in them, or the deer pass,"" answered Landless.  ""Oh,
my life! are you content?""

She answered with a low, clear laugh.  ""I hold happiness fast,"" she
said.  ""It cannot escape us now.""

""They are coming,"" he said.  ""The last kiss, heart of my heart.""

Their lips met, and their eyes with a smile in them met, and then he put
her gently behind him, and turned to again face Luiz Sebastian.

With his eyes fixed upon the yellow face, he had raised his hand to
strike at the yellow breast, spotted and barred with the black of the
war paint, when an Indian, gliding between, struck up his arm, and sent
the knife tinkling down upon the rocks.  With a yell of triumph the
savage snatched up the weapon, and brandished it, showing it to his
fellows, who, seeing their work accomplished, and the two whom they had
tracked so far actually in their hands, made the forest ring with their
exultant shouts.  A few closed in around the devoted pair, directing at
them fiendish cries and no less fiendish laughter, and menacing them
with knife and tomahawk, but the majority streamed down the steep and
into the forest at its base.

""They go to gather wood,"" said the still smiling Luiz Sebastian.  ""By
and by we are to have a bonfire. Señor Landless has often carried wood,
I think, in those old times when he was a slave, and when the pretty
mistress behind him there treated him as such—unless she gave him favors
in secret.  But, Mother of God! now that she has made him master, we
must carry the wood for him!""

Landless, standing with folded arms, looked at him with quiet scorn.
""It is the nature of the viper to use his venom,"" he said calmly.  ""Such
a thing cannot anger me.""

""At the same time it is as well to crush the viper,"" said a voice at his
elbow.

The speaker, who was Sir Charles Carew, had come from behind the
boulders which ran in a straggling line down the hillside toward the
river.  He had his drawn sword in his hand, and as he spoke, he ran the
mulatto through the body.  The wretch, his oath of rage and astonishment
still upon his lips, fell to the ground without a groan, writhed there a
moment or two, and then lay still forever.

From the forest below rose a loud confusion of shouts and cries,
followed by a volley of musketry. At the sound the half dozen savages
upon the plateau turned and plunged down the hillside, to be met before
they reached the bottom by the upward rush of a portion of the rescuing
party.  For a short while the twilight glades, low hills and frowning
crags rang to the sound of a miniature battle, to the quick crack of
muskets, the clear shouts of the whites, and the whoops of the savages.
But by degrees these latter became fainter, further between, died away—a
short ten minutes, and there were no warriors left to return to the
village in the Blue Mountains.  Fierce shedders of blood, they were paid
in their own coin.

On the hill-top Sir Charles shot his rapier into its scabbard, and
strode over to Patricia, standing white and still against the rock.  ""I
was in time,"" he said. ""Thank God!""

She made no motion to meet his extended hands, but stood looking past
him at Landless.  Her face was like marble, her eyes one dumb question.
Landless met their gaze, and in his own she read despair, renunciation,
strong resolve—and a long farewell.

""You are come in time, Sir Charles Carew,"" he said.  ""A little more, and
we should have been beyond your reach.  You will find the lady safe and
well, though shaken, as you see, by this last alarm. She will speak for
me, I trust, will tell you that I have used her with all respect, that I
have done for her all that I could do....  Madam, all danger is past.
Will you not collect yourself and speak to your kinsman and savior?""

He spoke with a certain calm stateliness of voice and manner, as of one
who has passed beyond all emotion, whether of hope or fear, and in his
eyes which he kept fixed upon her there was a command.

""Speak to me, my cousin; tell me that I am welcome,"" said Sir Charles,
flinging himself upon his knee before her.

With a strong shudder she looked away from the still, white, and sternly
composed face opposite to the darkening river and the evening star
shining calmly down upon a waste world.

At length she spoke.  ""I was all but beyond this world, cousin, so
pardon me if I seem to come back to it somewhat tardily.  You have my
thanks, of course—my dear thanks—for saving my life—my life which is so
precious to me.""

She gave him her hand with a strange smile, and he pressed his lips upon
it.  ""Your father is below, dearest cousin.  Shall we descend to meet
him?  As to this—gentleman,"" turning with a smile that was like a frown
to Landless, ""I regret that circumstances combine to prevent our
rewarding him as the guardian (a trusty one, I am sure) of so precious a
jewel should be rewarded.  But Colonel Verney will do—I will do—all that
is possible.  In the mean time I observe with regret that he is wounded.
If he will allow me, I will send him my valet, who is below, and is the
best barber surgeon in the three kingdoms.  Come, dearest madam.""

He bowed low and ceremoniously to Landless, who returned the salute with
grave courtesy, and gave his hand to Patricia.  For one moment she
looked at Landless with wide, dark eyes, then, her spirit obedient to
his spirit, she turned and went from him without one word or backward
look.

The color had quite faded from the west, and the stars were thickening
when Landless became conscious that the overseer was standing beside
him.  ""You are the hardest one to hold that ever I saw,"" said that
worthy grimly, and yet with a certain appreciation of the qualities that
made the man at his feet hard to hold showing in his tone, ""but I fancy
we ’ve got you at last.  You ’ve gone and put yourself in bilboes.""

Landless smiled.  ""This time you may keep me. I shall not interfere.
But tell me how you come here. You were sent back to the Plantations.""

""Ay,"" said the other, ""and there was the devil to pay, I can tell you,
when I had to report you missing to Sir William.  But Major Carrington
stood my friend, and I got off with a tongue-drubbing.  Well, after
about three weeks or so, during which time the dogs and the searchers
brought back most all of the run away niggers, and Mistress Lettice had
hysterics every day, back comes the Colonel and Sir Charles with ten of
the twenty men who had rowed them up the Pamunkey.  The rest had fallen
in a brush with the Monacans.  They had n’t come up with the
Ricahecrians, had n’t seen hair nor hide of them, had but one report
from the Indian villages along the river, and that was that no
Ricahecrians had passed that way.  So after a while they were forced to
believe that they were upon a false scent, and back they comes post
haste to the Plantations to get more men, and go up the Rappahannock.
Well, they went up the Rappahannock, and found nothing to their purpose,
so back they came again to try the James and the country above the
Falls.  This time they found the Settlements, which had been before like
an overturned hive, pretty quiet, the ringleaders of your precious plot
having all been strung up, and the rest made as mild as sheep with
branding and whipping and doubling of times.  So, the tobacco being in
and the plantation quiet, things were left to Haines, and I came along
with the Colonel.  Major Carrington, too, who they say is in the
Governor’s black books, though Lord knows he was active enough in
stamping out this insurrection, asked to be allowed to join in the
search for his old friend’s daughter, and so he’s down in the woods
yonder.  And Mr. Cary is there, and Mr. Peyton (Mistress Betty
Carrington made _him_ come) and Mr. Jaclyn Carter. Fegs! half the young
gentry in the colony pressed their services on the Colonel.  It got to
be the fashion to volunteer to run their heads into the wolf’s mouth for
Mistress Patricia.  But Sir Charles choked most of them off.
’Gentlemen,’ he says, says he, ’despite the saying that there cannot be
too much of a good thing, I beg to remind you that the disastrous
fortunes of those who first struggled with the forest and the Indians in
this western paradise are attributed to the fact that they were two
thirds gentlemen.  Wherefore let us shun the rock upon which they
split’—""

""How many of my fellow conspirators were put to death?"" interrupted
Landless.

""All the principal ones—them that Trail denounced as leaders.  The rest
we pardoned after giving them a lesson they won’t soon forget.  We let
bygones be bygones with the redemptioners and slaves—all but those
devils who got away that night at Verney Manor, and with Trail at their
head, made for Captain Laramore’s ship which was going to turn pirate.
Well, they got to the boats, and one lot got off safe to the ship which
hoisted the black flag, and sailed away to the Indies, and is sailing
there, murdering and ruining, to this day, I reckon.  But the other boat
was over full, and the steersman was drunken, and she capsized before
she got to the middle of the channel.  Some were drowned, and those that
got ashore we hung next morning.  But Trail was in the first boat.""

""When do you—do we—start down the river?""

""At midnight.  And it’s the Colonel’s orders that until then you stay
here among the rocks and not show yourself to the men below.  He ’ll see
you before we start.  In the mean time I ’ll keep you company.""  And the
overseer took out his pipe and tobacco pouch, filled the former, lighted
it, and leaning back against the rock fell to smoking in contented
silence.

Landless too sat in silence, with his head thrown back against the rock
and his face uplifted to the growing splendor of the skies.  The night
wind, blowing mournfully around the bare hill and the broken crag,
struck upon his brow with a hint of winter in its touch.  With it came
the tide of forest sounds—the sough of the leaves, the dull creaking of
branch against branch, the wash of the water in the reeds, the whirr of
wings, the cries of night birds—all the low and stealthy notes of the
earth chant which had become to him as old and tenderly familiar as the
lullabies of his childhood.  Below him, at the foot of the hill, a
square of dark and stately pines was irradiated by a great fire which
burnt redly, casting flickering shadows far across the smooth brown
earth, and around which sat or moved many figures.  Laughter and jest,
oaths and scraps of song floated up to the lonely watcher upon the
hilltop.  He heeded them not—he was above that world—and no sound came
from that other and smaller fire blazing at some distance from the
first—and the tree trunks between were so many and so thick that he
could see naught but the light.




                            *CHAPTER XXXVII*

                                 *VALE*


The overseer knocked the ashes from his pipe and stuck it in his belt.
""The master,"" he said curtly, getting to his feet as three cloaked
figures, followed by a negro bearing a torch, came up the hillside and
into the waste of stones beneath the crags. Advancing to meet them, he
took the torch from Regulus’s hand and fired a mass of dead and leafless
vine depending from the cliff.  In the bright light which sprang up,
filling the rocky chamber and burnishing the face of the crags into the
semblance of a cataract of fire, the parties to the interview gazed at
one another in silence.

Colonel Verney was the first to speak.  ""I am sorry to see that you are
wounded,"" he said gravely.

""I thank you, sir,—it is nothing.""

The Colonel walked the length of the plateau twice, then came back to
his prisoner’s side.  ""My daughter has told me all,"" he said somewhat
huskily.  ""That you and the Susquehannock sought for her and found her;
that you fought for her bravely more than once; that after the Indian
was slain you guided and protected her through the forest; that you have
in all things borne yourself towards her faithfully and reverently, not
injuring her by word, thought or deed. My daughter is very dear to
me—dearer than life. I am not ungrateful.  I thank you very heartily.""

""Mistress Patricia Verney is dear to me also,"" said Sir Charles, coming
forward to stand beside his kinsman.  ""I too thank the man who restores
her to her friends—to her lover.""

""And I would to God,"" said the third figure, advancing, ""that we could
save the brave man to whom so much is owed.  If I were Governor of
Virginia—""

""You could do naught, Carrington,"" broke in the Colonel impatiently.
""The man is convict—outside the pale!  A convict, and the head of an
Oliverian plot!  Scarce the King himself could pardon him! And if he
did, how long d’ ye think the walls of the gaol at Jamestown would keep
him from the rabble—and the nearest tree?  No, no, William Berkeley does
but his duty.  And yet—and yet—""

He began to pace the rocks again, frowning heavily, and pulling at the
curls of his periwig.  ""You are a brave man,"" he said at last, stopping
before Landless and speaking with energy, ""and from my soul I wish I
could save you.  I would gladly overlook all that is over and done with,
would gladly free you, aid you, help you, so far as might be, to
retrieve your past—but I cannot.  My hands are tied; it is
impossible—you must see for yourself that it is impossible.""

""None can see that so clearly as myself, Colonel Verney,"" Landless said
steadily.  ""I thank you for the will none the less.""

""To take you back with me,"" the other continued, beginning to stride up
and down again, ""is to take you back, bound, to certain death.  And
there is but one alternative—to leave you here in the wilderness. Your
presence here is known only to those upon whose discretion I can depend.
They would hold their tongues, and none need ever be the wiser.  But the
Settlements will be barred to you forever, and hundreds of leagues
stretch between this spot and the Dutch or the New Englanders.
Moreover, your description hath been sent to the authorities of each
colony.  And you are wounded, and winter is at hand. It may be but a
choice of deaths!  I would to God there were some other way—but there is
none!  You must choose.""

In the dead silence that ensued the Colonel moved back to the side of
the Surveyor-General, and the two stood, thoughtfully regardant of the
prisoner.  The light from the partially consumed vines beginning to
wane, the overseer motioned to Regulus to collect and apply his torch to
a quantity of the fagots with which the ground was strewn.  The negro
obeyed, and stood behind the light flame and curling smoke which he had
evoked, like the genie of an Arabian tale. Sir Charles, left standing in
the centre of the rocky chamber, hesitated a moment, then walked with
his usual languid grace over to where Landless leaned against a boulder,
his eyes, shaded by his hand, fixed upon the ground.

""Whichever you choose—Scylla or Charybdis—"" said Sir Charles in his most
dulcet tones, ""this is probably the last time you and I will ever speak
together.  There have been passages between us in the past, which, in
the light of after event, I cannot but regret.  You have just rendered
me an inestimable service.  I have learnt, too, that you saved my life
the night of the storming of the Manor House.  I beg to apologize to
you, sir, for any offense I may have given you by word or deed.""  And he
held out his hand with his most courtly smile.

""It becomes a dying man to be in charity with the world he leaves,"" said
Landless, somewhat coldly, but with a smile too, ""and so I do that which
I never thought to do,"" and he touched the other’s fingers with his own.

Sir Charles looked at him curiously.  ""You make a good enemy,"" he said
lightly.  ""Had it not been predestined that we were to hate each other,
I could find it in my heart to desire you for a friend.  You remain in
the forest, I dare swear?""

""Yes,"" answered Landless, with his eyes upon the light in the glade
below.  ""I choose the easier fate.""

""The easier for all concerned,"" said the other with a peculiar
intonation.

Landless glanced at him keenly, but the courtier face and the
inscrutable smile told nothing.  ""The easier for myself, whom alone it
concerneth,"" said Landless sternly.

Dragging himself up by the rock behind him, he turned to the two elder
men.  ""I have decided, Colonel Verney,"" he said slowly, ""I will stay
here, an it please you.""

""You shall have all that we can leave you,"" said the Colonel eagerly and
with some emotion. ""Ammunition in plenty, food, blankets, an axe—it’s
little enough I can do, God knows, but I do that little most willingly.""

""Again I thank you,"" said Landless wearily.

Sir Charles caught the inflection.  ""You stand in need of rest,"" he said
courteously, ""and, this matter settled, our farther intrusion upon you
is as unnecessary as it must be unwelcome.  Had we not best descend,
gentlemen?""

""Ay,"" said the Colonel.  ""We have done all we could.""  Then, to
Landless, ""With the moonrise we drop down the river—from out your sight
forever. I have told you frankly there is no hope for you amongst your
kind in the world to which we return. I believe there to be none.  But
have you thought of what we must needs leave you to?  Humanly speaking,
it is death, and death alone, in the winter forest.""

""I have thought,"" said Landless.

""From my soul I wish that some miracle may occur to save you yet!""

""An ill wish!"" said the other, smiling, ""with but little chance,
however, of its fulfillment.""

""I fear not,"" said the Colonel with something like a groan, ""but I wish
it, nevertheless.  Here is my hand, and with it my heartfelt thanks for
your service to my daughter.  And I wish you to believe that I deeply
deplore your fate, and that I would have saved you if I could.""

""I believe it,"" Landless said simply.

The Colonel took and wrung his hand, then turned sharply away, and
beckoning the overseer to follow, strode out of the circle of rocks.

Sir Charles raised his feathered hat.  ""We have been foes,"" he said,
""but the strife is over—and when all is said, we are both Englishmen.  I
trust we bear each other no ill will.""

""I bear none,"" said Landless.

Sir Charles, his eyes still fixed upon the pale quiet of the other’s
face, passed out of the opening between the rocks, and his place was
taken by the Surveyor-General.

""I would have saved you if I could,"" he said in a low and troubled
voice.  ""I bow to a brave man and a gallant gentleman,"" and he too was
gone.

In the glade below, the movement, the laughter and the song sank
gradually into silence as the gentlemen adventurers, the rangers, Indian
guides, and servants composing the rescuing party threw themselves down,
one by one, beside the blazing fires for a short rest before moonrise
and the long pull down the river.

Among the crags, high above the twinkling watch-fires and the wash of
the dark river, there was the stillness of the stars, of the white frost
and the bare cliffs.  In the northern heavens played a soft light, and
now and then a star shot.  The man who marked its trail across the
studded skies thought of himself as of one as far withdrawn as it from
the world of lower lights in the forest at his feet.  Already he felt a
prescience of the loneliness of the morrow, and the morrow, and the
morrow, of the slow drift of the days in the waning forest, the hopeless
nights, the terror of that great solitude—and felt, too, a feverish
desire to hasten that approach, to embrace that which was to be
henceforth bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. He wished for the
clash of oars in the dark stream below and for the rise of the moon
which was to shine coldly down upon him, companionless, immerged in that
vast fortress from which he might never hope to emerge.

The sound of cautious footsteps among the rocks brought his sick and
wandering fancy back to the present.  Raising himself upon his elbow and
peering intently into the darkness, he made out two figures, one tall
and large, the other much slighter, advancing towards him.  Presently
the larger figure stopped short, and, seating itself upon a flat rock at
the brink of the hill, turned its face towards the fires in the woods
below.  The other came on lightly and hurriedly—another moment, and
rising to his knees, he clasped her in his arms and laid his head upon
her bosom.

""I never thought to see you again,"" he said at last.

""I made Regulus bring me,"" she answered.  ""The others do not know—they
think me asleep.""

She spoke in a low, even, monotonous voice, and the hand which she laid
upon his forehead was like marble.  ""My heart is dead, I think,"" she
said.  ""I wish my body were so too.""

He drew her closer to him and covered her face and hands with kisses.
""My love, my lady,"" he said. ""My white rose, my woodland dove!""

She clung to him, trembling.  ""Down there I was going mad,"" she
whispered.  ""But now—now—I feel as though I could weep.""  He felt her
tears upon his face, but in a moment she was calm again. ""Do you
remember the bird we found the other day, all numbed with cold?"" she
said.  ""It had been gay and free and light of heart, but it had not
strength to flutter when I took it in my hands and tried to warm it—and
could not.  I am like that bird.  The world is very gray and cold, and
my heart—it will never be warm again.""

""God comfort you,"" he said brokenly.

""They have told me that at moonrise we leave this place—and you.  They
say that it is all they can do for you—to leave you here.  All!—Oh, my
God!""

""They have done what they could,"" he said gravely. ""I recognize that.
And I wish you to do so too, sweetheart.""

She looked at him wildly.  ""I have been silent,"" she said, pressing her
clasped hands against her bosom. ""I have not told them.  I have obeyed
what I read in your eyes.  But was it well?  Oh, my dear, let me speak!""

He took her hands from her breast and laid them against his own.  ""No,""
he said with a smile, ""I love you too well for that.""

From the woods across the river came the crying of wolves, then a
silence as of the grave; then a whisper arose in the long dry grass and
the leafless vines, and a cold breeze lifted the hair from their
foreheads. The whisper grew into a murmur, prolonged and deep, a sound
as of a distant cataract, or of the dash of surf upon a far away
shore—the voice of the wind in the world of trees.  A star shot, leaving
a stream of white fire to fade out of the dark blue sky.  From the
forest came again the cry of the wolves.  In the camp below there seemed
some stir, and the figure seated on the rock turned its head towards
them and lifted a warning hand.

""You must go,"" said Landless.  ""It was madness for you to venture here.
See, the light is growing in the east.""

With a low, desolate moaning sound she wrung the hands he released and
raised her face to his.  He kissed her upon the brow, the eyes and the
mouth. ""Good-by, my life, my love, my heart,"" he said. ""We were happy
for an hour.  Good-by!""

""I will be brave,"" she answered.  ""I will live my life out.  I will pray
to God.  And, Godfrey, I will be ever true to you.  I shall never see
you again, my dear, never hear of you more, never know till my latest
day whether you are of this world still, or whether you have waited for
me a long time, up there beyond those lights.  If it—if death—should
come soon, wait for me—beyond—in perfect trust, my dear, for I will come
to you—I will come to you as I am, Godfrey.""

He bowed his face upon her hands.

The breeze freshened, and the sound of the surf became the sound of
breakers.  In the east the pale light strengthened.  The figure below
them stood up and beckoned.

""The moon is coming,"" said Patricia.  ""Once before I watched for it—in
terror, with pride and anger in my heart.  Then, when I thought of you,
I hated you.  It is strange to think of that now.  Kiss me good-by.""

""I too will be strong,"" he said.  ""I will await the pleasure of the
Lord.  Until His good time, my bride!""

Rising to his feet he held her in his arms, then kissed her upon the
lips and put her gently from him.  For a moment she stood like a statue,
then with a lifted face and hands clasped at her bosom, she turned, and
slowly, but without a backward look, left the circle of rocks.  Through
the opening he saw the slave come up to her, and saw her motion to him
to fall behind—another moment, and both dark figures had sunk below the
brow of the hill.

Stronger and stronger blew the wind, louder and louder swelled the voice
of the forest.  Below, the wash of the river in its reeds, the dull
groaning of branch grating against branch, the fall of leaf and acorn,
the loud sighing of the pines, the cry of the owl, the panther and the
wolf—above, the vast dome of the heavens and the fading stars.  An
effulgence in the oast: a silver crest, like the white rim of a giant
wave, upon the eastern hills; a pale splendor mounting slowly and calmly
upward—a dead world,—all her passion, all her pain, all toil and strife
over and done with,—shining down upon a sadder earth.

From beneath the shadowy banks there shot out into the middle of the
broad moonlit stream a long canoe, followed by a second and a third, and
turning, went swiftly down that long, bright, shimmering, rippling path.

In the last and smallest of the three boats a man rose from his seat in
the stern, and with his eyes upon the line of moon-whitened cliffs above
him, raised his plumed hat with a courteous gesture, then bent and spoke
to a cloaked and hooded figure sitting, still and silent, between him
and a burlier form.  This canoe was rowed by negroes, and as they rowed
they sang. The wild chant—half dirge, half frenzy—that they raised was
suited to that waste which they were leaving.

The black lines upon the silver flood became mere dots, and the wailing
notes came up the stream faintly and more faintly still.  For a while
the echoes rolled among the folded hills and the tall gray crags, but at
length they died away forever.

PREFACE.


Courage to dare, fortitude to endure, enterprise to accumulate, and
prudence to retain, are qualities that, however valuable in themselves,
when in excess impart to character a coloring dry, hard, and even
render it repulsive. But if beneath the exuberance of young life we
detect the germs of those sympathies that, travelling beyond the limits
of self, recognizing the common bond that links all humanity, holds
fellowship with the joys and sorrows of others; that true nobility of
soul, not derived from without, but existing within, and ennobling
whatever it touches,--it is then that youth becomes most attractive,
its efforts win sympathy, its example is contagious. With ability to
accumulate, pluck to dare, and under the influence of the principles
referred to, these young deliverers consecrate themselves to a high
purpose, encounter peril and fatigue to break the fetters of their
humble friend, and restore him to his country and friends.

THE OVEN.


In courtesy to those who have not read the preceding volume of this
series, it is proper to observe that Arthur Brown, the principal
character of it, is a young man, twenty-one years of age, rescued,
in circumstances of peculiar peril, by Captain Rhines, who (in the
discharge of obligations incurred to the young man's father), together
with others, puts him in command of the brigantine ""Arthur Brown,""
named for the young man's father, who perished at sea.

The vessel, built by Charlie Bell at Pleasant Cove, modelled for speed,
with a numerous crew of able seamen, having already made a successful
voyage to Marseilles, a blockaded port, is now ready to sail again.
Walter Griffin is a Pleasant Cove boy,--belonging to a very athletic,
resolute family,--who began active life in a store, but, finding that
mode of life ill adapted to his inclinations and capacities, became a
sailor, shipped in the brigantine before the mast, and is now first
mate.

Ned Gates is a Salem boy, in his nineteenth year, rather small of his
age, was rescued at the same time with Arthur Brown by Captain Rhines
(the details of which occurrence will be found in the previous volume),
being a townie and at school with Arthur, was an excellent boy, and
much beloved by him.

On the former voyage, Walter and Ned were before the mast together, in
the same watch, and slept in the same berth, till, on the home passage,
Walter was promoted; their friendship still continues, although with
fewer opportunities of intercourse.

Jacques Bernoux is a Frenchman, native of Marseilles, fisherman by
occupation, and thoroughly acquainted with the coast.

James Peterson is a negro, born of slave parents in Martinique, but
sold in boyhood to an American captain, residing near Pleasant Cove,
and obtained freedom when slavery was abolished in New England.
Although ignorant and much addicted to intemperance at particular
times, he was very much liked (especially by two families, Captain
Rhines's and Edmund Griffin's), and by all the boys, because of other
sterling qualities. He was possessed of great personal strength, an
excellent seaman and pilot, first-rate calker, perfectly honest, and
of a most affectionate disposition. The boys idolized him, because
he taught them to wrestle, tie sailor knots, and, when at leisure,
was ever ready to make playthings for them. On stormy days, when it
was known he could not work, his house would be thronged with boys,
coaxing him to make one thing or another. Luce, his wife, was a
splendid cook, and nothing suited them better than to be asked to stop
to dinner; victuals tasted a great deal better there than at home.
Ben, his oldest son, was as great a favorite with the young fry as his
father,--excelling in all sports that required strength and agility,
always good-natured, never presuming, and full of queer, witty sayings.
Ben Peterson was (in boy language and estimation) a bully fellow.

Thus it fell out that the cross-path which led to his house was deeply
worn by young feet. Going to Peterson's, and having a good time, were
convertible terms.

By the efforts of his young friends, he was persuaded to abandon his
cups, and taught to read and write; the result of which was, that he
immediately began to acquire property, became a freeholder, and was
universally respected and beloved.

Captain Murch, of the mast ship Casco, coming home sick, a new captain,
of the name of Aldrich, was put in to go the voyage. It was very
difficult to get a crew for her, as he was generally disliked. Captain
Rhines, anxious to get the ship away, persuaded Peterson and another
by the name of Danforth Eaton to ship first, in consequence of which a
crew was obtained.

One evening, while the ship was lying in Martinique, Peterson (then
acting as cook, the cook having gone to the hospital, sick) was sent
ashore by the captain with letters. In the morning he was missing.
Search being made, it was evident that he returned on board, as a fire
was burning and breakfast partly prepared; at length his kerchief
was discovered on the fender, and the dock was dragged, but without
finding the body. The captain concluded that he had met with some old
shipmates the evening before, and was prevailed upon to take a friendly
glass, which waked up the old appetite, and the next morning he had
turned out early, obtained more liquor, fallen from the gangway plank,
and the tide had swept the body to sea. The crew, on the contrary,
refused to believe he drank, but thought he went ashore to get
something to season his stew, made, in his haste, a misstep, and fell
overboard.

Captain Rhines and the community at large inclined to the opinion of
the crew. His death was universally lamented; the boys sadly missed
their colored friend, and the grass grows over the well-worn path that
leads to his dwelling.

Captain Murch resuming the command, Aldrich went to England. Percival,
the mate, becoming intemperate, was reduced to the position of lumper
around the wharves in Boston.

There was, however, something quite mysterious about the disappearance
of Peterson: his family refused to believe he was dead, and opinions
were divided. It long formed a topic of dispute and discussion at the
winter firesides; some contending that a man so athletic and agile as
Peterson would have caught hold of something, and never would have been
drowned between the vessel and the wharf; at least, he would have made
an outcry; to which it was replied, that he might have struck his head
on the wharf or fender, and stunned himself. In reply to this, it was
urged that a negro's head is too thick to be affected in that manner.
After a while, other topics of interest came up, and the vexed subject
was gradually dropped. Before the arrival of the Casco, bringing that
sad news, the brigantine had sailed for Marseilles. Thus Walter and Ned
went away ignorant of the whole matter.

Walter and Ned had made their preparations for this voyage to
Marseilles with feelings quite different from that blithesome, buoyant
mood in which they weighed anchor before.

The death of Uncle Isaac, as he was fondly called by the young people,
had blighted anticipations of pleasure to be derived from going into
the woods during the holidays; and the loss of one who united in his
single person the characters of parent, counsellor, and most genial
companion, weighed heavily upon their hearts. Having been called to his
bedside, his last words of affectionate counsel to them were fresh in
their remembrance.

Ned Gates--Little Ned, as he was called at sea to distinguish him
from a man by the name of Edward--had grown remarkably, in both size
and strength, since his recovery from wounds received in running the
broadside of an English ship on the last voyage, and no longer merited
that appellation.

It is customary on shipboard for the boys and ordinary seamen to furl
the light sails. The royal, therefore, on board the Arthur Brown,
during the last voyage, pertained to Ned; but, in a vessel that spread
so much canvas as the brigantine, it was by no means a small sail. When
the wind blew fresh, and especially if the canvas was wet, all the way
he could manage it was to furl the yard-arms first, which, however,
was not seaman-like. In very bad weather he could not furl it at all,
although he sometimes exerted himself till his finger nails were torn
to the quick, and the blood spun from his nostrils.

It was a great mortification to him when a man was sent aloft to
help him. He would look as meeching as a dog caught in the act of
sheep-killing, and not get over it for a week.

After Walter, on the homeward voyage, was promoted to a chief mate's
berth, he, in order to save Ned's feelings, and enable him to handle
it, had a royal buntline rove, the legs of which, led through thimbles
on each leech, which spilled the sail, that is, threw the wind out of
it, gathered it up, and enabled him to handle it in all weathers.

Even this chafed the proud-spirited boy, because he thought everybody
knew what it was done for, and felt that it was a tacit acknowledgment
of incompetence.

Walter and Ned went on board the vessel in Boston some days before the
crew came up from Pleasant Cove. Ned goes aloft in the night, unreeves
the royal buntline, takes the thimbles from the sail, the block from
the eyes of the rigging, and the thimbles from the tie, and stows them
all away.

""Ned,"" said Walter, the next day, as he was looking over the
running-rigging, preparatory to bending sails, ""where is the royal
buntline?""

""I thought, sir, it wouldn't be needed,"" replied Ned, slightly
coloring; ""so I unrove and stowed it away.""

""All right. I missed it, and thought some dock thief had stolen it.""

The shrewd course of Captain Brown, in making Jacques Bernoux a
handsome present for his past services, and thus attaching him to
his interests, was now evident. Jacques was not merely a fisherman,
but also a pilot, and thoroughly acquainted with the coast all along
the shores of the Gulf of Lyons, and especially between Toulon and
Marseilles. Along some portions of the gulf the land is low, and there
are many lagoons, separated by narrow portions of land, into which the
sea is forced by storms; but towards Toulon the shores are bolder, and
the land broken into many rocky heights and promontories, intersected
by creeks and coves. With every one of these Jacques was thoroughly
acquainted, as he had been a smuggler before his marriage.

All the passage Captain Brown was studying the charts of the French
coast, and obtaining information from Jacques in respect to it.

Arthur Brown had no ordinary foes to deal with. Lord Hood was in
command of the Mediterranean fleet, with orders to take all vessels, of
whatever nation, attempting to enter Marseilles or Toulon, and under
him was Nelson, in the Agamemnon, sixty-four guns--a very fast ship,
that is, for an English ship. It was merely a question of shrewdness
and seamanship, as the Arthur Brown was unarmed, and could not resist.

In order to pass the time at sea, Jacques frequently told stories
in relation to his expeditions with the smugglers, and, among other
things, described a cove where he had often aided to land cargoes of
smuggled goods, and which was singularly adapted for concealment.

The captain listened attentively, but, at the conclusion of the story,
merely remarked that it must be a curious place.

It was the middle of an afternoon, and the vessel well in with the
land, when they made a sail, which Jacques, after looking at it a long
time with the glass, declared to be Nelson's ship.

""I don't care who she is,"" said the captain; ""she's dead to leeward.
She can't catch us, and we can dodge her in the night.""

The wind was blowing a wholesale breeze, and fair.

""Jacques,"" said the captain, laying his hand on the pilot's shoulder,
""do you remember that singular cove you were telling about a fortnight
ago?""

""The oven, sir?""

""That's it. Could you take a vessel in there in the night?""

""Yes, captain, night or day. I know it as well as I know the way to my
berth.""

""It is bright starlight; the wind is fair, and plenty of it. Put this
vessel in there before daylight, and I'll make it the best night's work
you ever did in your life.""

""I can take you in, captain; but remember it is an oven. If any of the
fleet see you, you are gone.""

""I'll take the risk.""

With a spanking breeze, and every inch of canvas spread that would
draw, the swift vessel sped on her way, and long before daybreak was
under the shadow of the land, with her studding-sails and all her
square-sails taken in.

The entrance was so narrow that two vessels could not have gone in
abreast, while high bluffs and overhanging foliage made it as black as
a wolf's mouth. The ship's company held their breath. The vessel seemed
rushing on to certain destruction; but, as she rounded a high bluff,
the wind was left behind, and, after running twice her length into a
calm basin, Jacques ordered the anchor let go, and she was brought up.

""There, captain,"" said Jacques, ""I've put you into a harbor where no
wind can touch you, and about half way between Marseilles and Toulon.
The rest is your affair.""

""How much of this vessel, lying here, could be seen from a passing
ship?""

""A vessel of this size, nothing below the top-mast-head. Besides,
men-of-war don't care to come in here. There are batteries on the shore
a mile from this, each way. If they thought of looking, they couldn't
see so small a spar as this vessel's topgallant-mast without a glass.""

The morning light revealed a most singular place. On the starboard
hand, a rugged promontory, covered with a thick growth of pine and
fir, mixed with oak and ash, rose perpendicularly from the sea. The
other, and port side of the entrance, was formed by a small island,
its extremity, like that of the other point, terminating in a long,
rocky, and wooded bluff, but of less height. (Perhaps some of our young
readers may have noticed, and thought strange, that seamen never say,
""Put the helm to larboard,"" or speak of the larboard side of a vessel,
but say, ""Port the helm,"" ""Hard a-port,"" or, ""Hard down."" _Port_ is a
military term borrowed from the French, an abbreviation of ""_Porta la
timone_,"" meaning, ""Carry the helm to the left,"" because soldiers,
when they port arms, carry the pieces to the left.)

The inner extremity of this island, where it approached the main land,
""locked by"" (as the seamen say) another wooded point of the main shore,
affording between them only a shallow and tortuous passage for small
boats. The position of these two points completely intercepted the view
of the harbor from the sea. It was only from the main shore that it was
possible to look into it through the passage between the points.

It must be evident to our young readers that the captain of the
brigantine could only hope to escape capture, or at least the loss
of vessel and cargo, by concealment. In entering this oven, he had
completely cut himself off from all chance of flight, since, should the
enemy discover him, a man-o'-war's crew might easily enter, and tow the
vessel out or set her on fire.

On the other hand, if undiscovered, he was in a safe harbor; the cargo,
in case of necessity, could be landed, and transported to Marseilles or
Toulon by land; and it was sufficiently valuable to leave a handsome
profit, even if the vessel was lost.

""It is best,"" said the captain, ""to be on the safe side, especially if
you have to do with English sailors, commanded by Nelson, who hates a
Yankee as much as he does a Frenchman. If we had to do with Frenchmen
and Spaniards, it would be another matter.""

He instantly set the crew at work to send down the foretopgallant-mast
and maintop-mast, with the yards. He then run a hawser to a tree, and,
paying out on the cable, hauled the vessel in close under the high
cliffs on the starboard hand, and, not satisfied even with this, cut
branches from the trees, and lashed them to the head of the mainmast
and also of the foretop-mast. It was now impossible to see the vessel
from sea; and even a boat pulling along shore could not perceive her
without actually entering the mouth of the oven. This was next to
impossible, as man-o'-war boats, liable to be fired upon with small
arms and field-pieces, were not inclined to venture near the shore
without some special object, or information of some valuable prize,
which might repay them for the risk. Jacques, having received a very
handsome reward from the captain, went to Marseilles to see his family,
and bore a message from the captain to merchants there, to whom he sold
his former cargo.




CHAPTER II.

NED PROPOSES TO IMPROVE THE DIVINE PLAN.


It was the intention of Captain Brown to wait till a gale of wind
scattered the blockading fleet, and, taking advantage of the
opportunity thus afforded, run into Marseilles, as the distance was
short, and the course along shore.

The crew, having little or nothing to do, except that they hauled the
brigantine ashore, cleaned her bottom, and covered it with a fresh coat
of soap and tallow, mended the sails, and overhauled the rigging, spent
the time in the manner most agreeable to their own inclinations, mended
and made clothes and hats, lounged, bathed, or slept. Boys so well
conditioned and full of life as Walter and Ned, could not pass their
time in any such way as that.

The first thing they set themselves about after the vessel's bottom was
cleaned, was to make a rope ladder and fasten it to one of the lower
limbs of a large, evergreen oak, that stood on the highest part of the
bluff; the ladder was made in this manner: they fastened three parts
of a rope to a large branch near the body of the tree; a studding-sail
boom was placed upon the ground and lashed to the roots of other
trees; to this they fastened three old bull's eyes, rove the rigging
through them, and set up their shrouds by the end taut with a Spanish
windlass--an extemporaneous machine, but of considerable power, made by
sailors with two levers and a piece of small rope; they then rattled
the shrouds down (fastened small ropes across to step on), and were
provided with an excellent method of ascent.

They next made fast a single block to the top of the tree, rigged a
whip, with it hoisted up poles and planks, laid a platform, and railed
it in with poles lashed to the limbs of the tree. It was a project of
Ned's, Walter having told him about Charlie Bell and his boy companions
constructing one somewhat similar in the top of the big maple, on
Elm Island. This, however, far exceeded that, inasmuch as they were
possessed of rigging and all requisite materials to work with.

Walter, who at first did not feel much interested in the effort, but
engaged in it to gratify Ned, soon became very much so in consequence
of working on it, and proposed a great many additions to the original
conception of Ned, which was merely to construct a lookout, from
which, with the excellent glass of the captain, they might see a great
distance, and watch the motions of the blockading fleet.

""Ned,"" said he, ""let us make some chairs to sit in; we don't want to
sit down flat on the platform.""

""Well, that will be nice; but what shall we make them of?""

""Empty bread barrels,"" replied Walter, who, a Griffin, inherited all
the mechanical ingenuity of his race. Forthwith they ""roused"" the
grindstone out of the long-boat, the rusty tools from the tool chest,
ground a chisel, draw-shave, and plane-irons, and Walter filed the
handsaw.

The tools in order, Ned set to work planing some pieces of boards on
one side. Walter took a barrel, and after nailing well the hoops,
sawed it across, just above the second hoops, to a depth which left
sufficient wood to form the back, being careful to stop at a joint in
the staves. He then made a cut of the same depth and height from the
ground on the other end and the other side.

All that held the barrel together now was the bilge hoops of each end;
these he cut through, when the barrel dropped apart, making two chairs,
as far as backs and legs were concerned, but minus the seat. He now
took a flat hoop, bent it round the inside of the barrel to the height
of the saw-cut, fastened the ends together with a nail, and gave it to
Ned. ""There, Ned, is the measure of your bottom.""

He then by a mark which he had made along the edge of the hoop,
proceeded to nail on supports for the seat; Ned, in the mean while,
putting the pieces of board side by side, laid the hoop on them, marked
out and sawed off the pieces he had planed, trimmed the edge with a
draw-shave, fayed in the bottom, and nailed it, while Walter was at
work upon another barrel; he then nailed a piece of hoop around the
top edge of the back to keep the staves in place, and cut a hole for
the hand to move it by. When they had made four they hoisted them to
the platform, and sat down with the greatest satisfaction imaginable.
The backs were rather low, and perfectly straight; but so were all the
chairs of that period; and there was not the least danger of the legs
of their chairs coming out. People in those days had not time to loll;
there were not so many inventions for the comfort of lazy folks as at
the present.

They were soon convinced that their labors possessed a practical value,
and were appreciated: the captain, finding the platform an excellent
lookout, easy of access, the chairs convenient, took his telescope up,
and would sit there and smoke. Walter, noticing this, made a box and
fastened it to the railing to keep the telescope in, and protect it
from the weather. The crew also went up there; so they made four more
chairs to accommodate their company. Mr. Hadlock, the second mate, was
very partial to the tree.

""O, Walter,"" said Ned, as they sat conversing after dinner, ""I wish
James Peterson was here.""

""So do I; he is such a good man, and could tell us so many things, for
he knows so much more than Bernoux, and is well acquainted in this
country.""

""O, isn't he good, Walter! How much he did for me when I was sick!""

""Do you know, Ned, one of the first things I can remember is going down
to Peterson's with mother or grandsir (when he was able to walk about),
and Luce baking me turnovers, and Peterson making playthings for me. I
tell you there wasn't a spear of grass in the path that ran across lots
from our house to James's. I used to eat half my meals there; victuals
tasted better there than anywhere else. I tell you, Ned, it takes Luce
to cook. I heard Lion Ben tell father that if Peterson had received an
education, there wouldn't be many ahead of him.""

""He thinks a great deal of you, Walter. Don't you remember, the night
you was going to be landed on that rock right in the ocean, and left
there all alone, how he came forward and insisted on going in your
room?""

""There's another I wish was here,"" said Walter, in a subdued tone, ""and
who will not be there to shake hands with us when we get home from this
voyage.""

""Uncle Isaac,"" said Ned, his eyes filling.

Walter made no answer, and the conversation dropped. After sitting
a while in silence, the boys, saddened by the tender and touching
associations invoked, left the spot, went on board the vessel, and set
to work stopping a leak in the coating of the mainmast. The next day a
peasant brought along a straw hive of honey to sell. The boys bought
some, and, on going to the tree to eat it, found there the captain and
second mate, with whom they shared, as they had purchased no small
quantity.

While they were talking and eating, wishing for a gale of wind--a real
Gulf of Lyons gale--to scatter the fleet, they saw a man-o'-war get
under way, evidently for England, convoying two supply-ships.

The captain ascertained her name through Jacques; and it afterwards
appeared that Nelson wrote to his brother by the man-o'-war that the
inhabitants of Marseilles and Toulon were starving; that the blockade
had been so strict, not even a boat could get into either place or on
the coast with provisions. While this brave seaman was battling with
the furious gales, heavy seas, thunder, lightning, and squalls of
the Mediterranean, Captain Brown, Walter Griffin, Ned Gates, and Sam
Hadlock were lying among the foliage of the oak, eating honey and soft
bread, or watching him through the glass, and counting the very buttons
on his coat, as he stood back and forth along the coast, patient,
resolute, faithful to his weary, harassing task, and congratulating
himself upon the strictness of the blockade.

""For nineteen weeks,"" writes he, ""my crew have not had a morsel of
fresh meat or vegetables; only salt junk, hard bread, and lime-juice.""

During all this time, a Yankee brigantine, loaded to the bends with
wheat and good yellow corn raised by Captain Rhines, Uncle Isaac, Lion
Ben, Charlie Bell, and their neighbors, and pork, beef, saltpetre, and
arms bought in England or the British provinces, was lying, almost
within gunshot, in a _cul-de-sac_, where she could not escape if
discovered, and coining money for her officers, crew, and owners.

While thus eating and chatting, they were joined by Jacques, who had
returned from a visit to his family.

""Pilot,"" said the captain, ""is there any good place near here where we
can fill water?""

""Yes, captain; never a better.""

The next morning, the water-casks were put into a boat, and Jacques
piloted them to the place. It was a lovely spot. Over the edge of
a precipice crowned with pines poured, in one broad sheet, a swift
mountain torrent into a rocky basin, from which the white froth floated
off into the cove. The water was of sufficient depth to enable them to
approach with the boat to the edge of the basin, from which they dipped
the clear, cool water--every instant renewed, and through which the
white pebbles were gleaming--in buckets, and, passing them from hand to
hand, filled the casks without taking them from the boat.

""We must be lively, boys,"" said Walter, ""and get it in before the tide
falls. O, I forgot; there is no tide here; so we can take our time.""

Our young readers will recollect there is no tide in the Mediterranean,
or but very little, except as influenced by storms.

As they were returning, Ned said, ""Wouldn't it be nice if it was so
at home, Mr. Griffin?"" (putting on the Mr. before the crew.) ""There's
Captain Rhines's Cove: the water ebbs way out, quarter of a mile of
mud. If you want to go out at low water, you must shove off a skiff,
and wade in the mud. Only think how nice it would be to be able to go
just when you pleased! no bother about the tide, and having to work in
the night to save it; and only think what an everlasting sight of work
and expense it would save in building those great long wharves, that
vessels may lie afloat at low water!""

""I don't know about that, Ned. I think there's something to be said in
favor of the tide. Just call to mind what an abominable dirty hole the
port of Marseilles is; all the filth of the city pouring into it; no
motion only in a gale of wind, and not much then; all that foul stuff
stewing and simmering under a southern sun. If there was a tide to make
a current, bring in a fresh supply of water, and carry off this slime
every six hours, how much better it would be!""

""I never thought of that, Mr. Griffin.""

""There's another thing I should think you would have thought of, Ned,""
said Mr. Hadlock.

""What is that, sir?""

""Why, in respect to cleaning, calking, or graving a vessel's bottom,
repairing, or stopping a leak. See what a fuss we had here the other
day, cleaning and putting tallow on this vessel's bottom; had to heave
her out, and work and wade in the water at that. Now, if we had been at
home, all we need to have done would have been to haul her on to the
beach in Captain Rhines's Cove that you despise so much, at high water,
ground her, and have eight or ten hours to work, on a good sand beach,
too.""

""I guess,"" said Ned, ""I should have done better to have held my tongue.""

Our readers will bear in mind that there were no railways in those
days by which vessels are hauled out of the water, or dry docks into
which they are floated at high water, and the water pumped out; but our
forefathers grounded them across logs or blocks, or, if they wanted to
get at the keel, hove them down on one side, by means of tackles made
fast to the mast-heads, till the keel was out of water.

""That is not all, either, Ned,"" said the second mate. ""If the tide
didn't ebb, there wouldn't be any clams; and that would be a very
serious affair indeed to the fishermen who want bait. Once it would
have caused starvation in some cases, and might again.""

""How could that be, sir?""

""I'll tell you, my boy. You were born and have grown up in Salem, and
don't, perhaps, realize the value of clams; but I do. I've heard old
Mr. Griffin, the mate's grandfather, say, that when he was cutting down
the trees on his place, before he could raise anything, and met with
bad luck in hunting, he had been, the first summer or two, so put to
it for food, that he had to boil beech leaves, the ends of the branches
and the tops of the pine trees (that are very tender in June, when they
are growing fast), to preserve life, and that if it had not been for
clams, he and his family must have starved. I'm sure they were a great
help to us after my father died, for we were very poor. I was young,
not strong enough to do much work; but I could dig clams, and my little
sister picked them up. I could, with them for bait, catch fish and
lobsters, and with a little rye and Indian bread and some bean broth,
mother got along, and kept us all together. Had it not been for the
clam flats, I don't know what we should have done.""

""I can say amen to that,"" said Willard Lancaster; ""and I know that when
Peterson used to drink so bad, and brought little or nothing home to
his family, that Luce and the children got most of their living out of
the clam flats.""

""It is not only the value of the clams as food,"" said Walter, ""but a
good part of the fish that are cured and exported to all parts of the
world to feed thousands, are caught with clam bait.""

""That, indeed,"" said the captain. ""What vast quantities of fish are
exported from Salem to the West Indies and other places! and that is
but a trifle compared with the whole amount.""

""Yes, indeed, sir. I didn't think of all these uses for the tide. I was
thinking only how convenient it would be to have it always high water
for a few things.""

""There are many other things,"" said Walter, ""that the ebb and flow of
the tide are very convenient for. Three years ago, father was building
a wharf in our cove: the logs were master great ones; it would have
taken twenty men to place them where we wanted them; but father and I
cut the scores in the other logs to receive them, rolled them into the
water with the oxen, then tied a rope to them, floated them at high
water to the spot, held them till the tide ebbed, and they settled into
the grooves just as easy as a cat would lick her ear. We didn't lift an
ounce; the tide lifted all those big logs for us. Did you ever see the
Casco, Ned?""

""No, sir; she was always away when I was at Pleasant Cove, but I've
heard say she is a monster.""

""So she is--seven hundred tons; you may judge what her anchors must be.
Well, I can tell you what they are: the best bower is 3000, and the
small bower 2700.""

""O, my! What a junk of iron that must be!""

""We rode out a gale of wind in Cadiz, with both anchors ahead and all
the scope out. It blew a gale, I tell you, and the anchors were well
bedded. When we came to get under way for home, we hove up the small
anchor; but the other we hove, and hove, and hove, and couldn't start
it. At last the captain said, 'Avast heaving; let the tide take it
out.' We waited till low water, hove her down as long as we could catch
a pawl on the windlass, and made all fast. At length the tide began to
flow, the ship began to bury forward; down she went, till the water
was coming into the hawse-holes, the cable sung, and the tar began to
stand in drops on it with the strain, when all at once the anchor let
go with a surge that threw every man from his feet. The tide was very
convenient then; if it had not been for it, we must have gone ashore,
got a grappling, and grappled to the fluke of the anchor, or left it.
Again the tide is very convenient for a timepiece; if you keep the run
of the tide, you have the time of day.""

""It is about as well to take things as the Lord has arranged them,""
said the captain, ""and be contented and thankful.""

""That,"" said Ned, ""brings to my mind a piece mother read to me once,
about a man who thought, if the disposition of affairs had been
committed to him, he could have arranged them a great deal better than
they now are; that it was not at all proper that so large and noble a
thing as a pumpkin should be attached to a vine lying upon the ground,
while so insignificant a thing as an acorn or beech-nut grew upon a
lofty tree: but falling asleep one day under an oak, an acorn falling
on his nose awoke him, when he exclaimed, 'Wretch that I am! Had it
been a pumpkin it would have dashed my brains out.' I don't know as I
recollect it aright, but that was the amount of it.""

""It is certainly better, Ned, to be in the hands of a wise and good
Providence, than to be left to plan for ourselves. If the disposal of
events had been committed to you or me, we never should have suffered
the Madras to spring a leak, and endured what we did upon the raft; yet
it carried us to Pleasant Cove, to Captain Rhines and Charlie Bell,
and was the best thing that could have happened to either of us. Way
enough, men; fend off, Jacques.""




CHAPTER III.

THE BOYS CONSCIOUS OF HIGHER AIMS.


Those luxurious boys, not satisfied with eating soft bread, lolling
in their new chairs, bathing and frisking in the blue waters of the
Mediterranean, resolved to sleep in the Bird's Nest, as they had
christened the structure in the tree. This was a plan of Ned, who
proposed taking their beds up into the tree and sleeping there.

""Don't let us sleep on that old straw, but throw it away and get some
fresh,"" said Walter; ""though, upon second thoughts, I don't know where
we should get it. These peasants only raise rye, and rye straw is too
hard, only fit for stuffing horse collars. Let us get moss and beech
leaves, Ned; the old leaves that have fallen off will be just the
thing, only dry them.""

""So we will.""

""I'll tell you what I've been thinking of. Wonder I didn't think of it
before.""

""Let's hear.""

""We've been here some time, little or nothing to do, and have not been
fifty rods from the beach. Suppose before two days there should come
a gale of wind, a real snorter, set the blockading fleet a flying,
everything head over heels, and it is, up topgallant-mast, send up
topgallant and royal yards, mast-head the topsail, man the windlass,
up anchor and away for Marseilles. By and by we get home. Charlie
Bell and Captain Rhines say (as I know they will), 'Well, boys, have
you seen any place you like better than home? What kind of land is
it? What crops do they grow? Did the people seem happy, and do they
live any better or know any more than we do? Do they live by farming,
fishing, lumbering, or manufacturing? Are they any better off since
they killed their king and a good part of their aristocracy than they
were before?' We should have to scratch our heads, and say, 'We don't
know; had plenty of time, but didn't go anywhere.' 'What did you do
with yourselves,' they will ask. 'We made a nest in the top of a tree,
took our beds up, and slept there; made chairs, sat there, talked, and
went a fishing.'""

""Don't say any more, Walter. I'm sure you've made it out bad enough.""

""Then, perhaps, they would think, if they didn't say it, that it was
rather small business for a mate of a vessel who wanted to be master,
and a young fellow who wanted to be mate, and had run the broadside of
a hundred gun ship, and been twice wounded, to be spending all their
time building birds' nests: better leave that to the birds, and set
about the business they were made for.""

""Come, grandfather,"" replied Ned, patting Walter's cheek, ""just leave
that alone; this nest is not without its use. We must have some place
for a lookout to watch the fleet: and, were it not for this, the
captain would have to go the best part of a mile to a hill. These
chairs are a real comfort to him, as well as to us. I'm sure it is
our duty to do anything we can for him, who is so good to us, and
puts us ahead. A fellow must have some fun to oil the wheels and make
everything run smooth; besides, _grandpa_, you will be obliged to
allow, that if I first thought of making the nest, you have put ten
times the work in it I ever intended doing; and I'm sure the chairs
were all your own getting up; and now you want to get moss to fill beds
with.""

""There, you've said enough, you little monkey.""

""I think this nice warm climate, just like May, makes anybody feel lazy
and shiftless. Only think, Wal, at home, now, they are all covered up
in snow, icicles hanging from the cattle's noses, and big roaring fires
in the houses; and here I saw yesterday, right on the side of that
little knoll, strawberries in blossom.""

""I guess you're right, Ned,"" said Walter, stretching himself; ""and that
is just as our Joe is always saying--the frost puts the grit in.""

""I guess so, for there don't seem to be much grit in the folks here; it
seems as though the women did half the work.""

""Let us ask the captain, Ned, for liberty to go and take a look at the
country; then we can get information, and something to fill our beds
with, besides having a good time--pleasure and profit, youngster.""

""Where shall we sleep; out doors?""

""Yes; take a blanket (the weather is warm), just to keep the dew off.""

""And we can carry provisions?""

""Yes, and fireworks.""

""I should like that; it would be something like what we were going to
do at Pleasant Cove, when uncle Isaac was hurt. I never was in the
woods; always have been either at school or at sea.""

""I don't think you'll find much woods, I can't see from the tree any
that I should call woods. There seems to be as much about this oven as
anywhere, and I suppose that was left to shelter and conceal the harbor
for the smugglers.""

""I tell you, Walter, 'twill seem real nice, after being penned up
aboard ship, to lie down under a tree, stretch out, loll about, no
'anchor watch,' don't care whether school keeps or not, even if you
don't do any more than that.""

""There's a roll of canvas under my berth. I'll ask the captain to give
us enough to make a couple of packs.""

Having obtained the canvas, needles, and twine, they were soon in the
Bird's Nest, sewing and talking over their proposed tramp. They invited
Jacques to make one of the party; but he was about to return and resume
his employment of fishing, and in the mean time keep watch of the
English fleet, and pick up any information that was valuable, until his
services should be again required as pilot.

Walter sent Ned to the captain for liberty, which he not only gave
cheerfully, but added, ""There's nothing to be done; you may stay as
long as you like; only be sure, if you see any change in the weather,
to hurry aboard.""

Ned, delighted, thanked the captain most enthusiastically.

""You know, Ned,"" said he, ""you have not enjoyed much for a boy. You've
never had a great deal of boyhood, you were kept at school very closely
by your parents, then went to sea, was cast away. When you got over
that, went right off again, was wounded, suffered a great deal, and
then was disappointed in respect to the good time you were reckoning
upon at Pleasant Cove with Mr. Murch and Walter. Now you are a right
down good boy, Ned, and I hope you will enjoy yourself, for nobody can
tell what will befall us next.""

Having set out at sunrise, they travelled till noon, and after gaining
the summit of a high hill, lay down beneath a tree to rest. Their life
on shipboard had entirely unfitted them for walking; the strap of the
packs cut their shoulders, and they were thirsty, for the dry, barren
plains of Provence afforded no water: they were extremely fatigued.

After stretching themselves at full length upon the ground to rest,
not caring whether school kept or not, they went in quest of water, and
at last came to a place where a very little trickled from a seam in the
ledge, but was evaporated by the hot sun, nearly as fast as it ran,
barely moistening the rock.

""What shall we do, Walter?""

""I'll show you.""

He broke some branches from a clump of pine bushes, set them against
the rock, then sat down with Ned under them. The bushes kept off the
sun, and the water, no longer evaporating, collected in a little cavity
of the rock, and they were bountifully supplied. Opening their packs,
they began to eat with the greatest relish.

""We're all right now, Wal!"" said Ned.

""I shall be when I get this junk of beef down. It came from Elm
Island--Lion Ben's old brindled ox. Only see the fat on it!--that goes
to the right place, Ned. I call this rather a poor, mean country; the
soil seems to be a hungry gravel, all burnt up; scarcely any wood.""

""I suppose they don't need a great deal, only a little to cook with,
the weather is so warm.""

""The captain says they have cold winds in the spring, from the
mountains, and hail and snow--hail enough sometimes to kill sheep and
destroy the whole crop.""

They now resumed their packs and went on, chatting and making their
observations in respect to the land and the peasants whom they saw at
work in the fields.

""Where do these people live?"" asked Ned. ""I don't see a house, although
there are plenty of fields, and people at work in them. Only see the
women shovelling sand and picking up rocks! As I live, if there ain't a
horse and jackass working together!""

""Look over there,"" said Walter; ""see those oxen, the yoke lashed to
their horns.""

""Wonder where they cut any hay!"" said Ned; ""don't see any
mowing-fields.""

""I don't suppose they need much; they have no snow to lie, and the
cattle graze all winter.""

""I should think so, by the looks of them.""

""O, Ned, what kind of a tree is that, with those rough things on the
branches? Let's go and see. Why, it's a chestnut! Here are some just
such as they sell in the stores.""

""Why, Walter, didn't you ever see a chestnut tree before?""

""No; they don't grow our way; only walnuts and butternuts.""

""There's plenty of them in Massachusetts. But what are all these stone
walls built round the sides of the hills for? and what is that growing
on them?""

""Vines; I've seen those in Spain.""

""But how do they ever get any manure up there?""

""Lug it on their backs in baskets.""

""I guess this land must all belong to one man, for I don't see any
division fences; only once in a while a ditch, or a little pile of
stones. He must have an everlasting sight of land, for I can't see any
house. What kind of a tree is that with pale green leaves?""

""An olive.""

""Is that what they make oil from, Walter?""

""Yes.""

""And that one next to it?""

""A fig tree.""

""How do you know?""

""Jacques showed me one at Marseilles, last voyage, in a garden.""

""And these others?""

""I don't know what they are.""

""I think it's queer. Here are pines, beeches, and ash, just such as we
have at home, and olives and figs growing right among them. I don't
see, when we get all the rest, why we can't have the olives and figs.""

They now ascended a hill, and, upon reaching the summit, looked down
upon a vale, which presented so striking a contrast to the dry and
barren soil they had passed over as to cause them to exclaim, ""How
beautiful!""

It was indeed a lovely spot. The place itself, the productions of
the earth, and surrounding scenery, were so entirely different from
anything the boys had ever witnessed, that they remained for some
moments lost in silent wonder. It was sheltered from the mountain
blasts by hills, whose sides were terraced and covered with vines.
Skirting the base of the hills, on the north side, flowed a broad, deep
brook, from which the water, conducted in canals in all directions,
watered the whole vale. Not a fence, ditch, or hedge marred the
beautiful harmony of the picture, where the soil, abundantly watered,
sheltered, and beneath a fervid sun, manifested an exuberance unknown
in more northern climes.

""Look, Walter. I see the spire of a church, or something that looks
like it, between those two hills.""

""Yes; I see it. Those people seem very kind. Let us go and have a talk
with that old man who is at work at the foot of that tree with such a
lot round him; all the family, I guess. You speak to him, Ned.""

Walter knew that the French he had learned from the exiles at
Salem was quite different from the patois of Provence, being the
language of cultivated society, whereas Ned had picked his up from
Peterson, Jacques, and Mr. Bell, and it was the very dialect of this
locality,--the dialects, in different parts of France, differing almost
as much as the climate. Walter had also learned many words from the
same source as Ned.

""I'll speak to him; I can talk their lingo first rate now; but let us
sit down and rest a while.""

""I'm real tired; where shall we sleep to-night?""

""Under that high cliff, the other side of the valley; and we can drink
from the brook. I see some trees there, and we can make our fire right
under them, drive a stake into some crevice, hang our kettle, and have
a cup of tea.""

""Think we couldn't get some milk of those folks, Wal?""

""I expect it would be goat's milk, if we did.""

""Goat's milk is first rate, I tell you. We had two goats aboard the
Madras.""

""Perhaps it is; but it always seemed to me that it must taste just as a
goat smells.""

""O, Wal, what a boy you are! Who ever heard of tasting a smell?""

""I don't care. There's a mighty difference between a cow and a goat. A
cow's breath is as sweet as a rose.""




CHAPTER IV.

GABRIEL QUESNARD.


As they lay with heads pillowed on their packs, ""Ned,"" said Walter, ""I
wish we could imitate Charlie Bell, John Rhines, and Fred Williams in
something besides building a platform in a tree-top, or getting coral
and sponge to take home with us, or even obtaining information about
the people and country we are in.""

""I think this is first rate,"" said Ned, sticking his legs, which were
stiff and swollen with walking, up in the air. ""What would you have,
Wal? I think we've both done pretty well. I made a hundred dollars a
month clear, last voyage; you, twice that; which is more than they all
did when they started.""

""But we have been hired, and have only done what other people laid out
for us; whereas they struck out for themselves, planned, worked, and
built a vessel, as you may say, out of nothing, owned and loaded her to
boot.""

""There were four of them, and they had good advisers; but, when left on
that rock alone, didn't you get hold of Jacques, and wasn't it due to
your resolution and contrivance that the vessel got into Marseilles,
and made all she did make?""

""Ned, do you think getting money or being smart is to be put before
everything else?""

""I guess I don't,"" said Ned, rolling over, and putting his arm round
Walter. ""I think having friends to love who love you, and to do what is
right, is to be put ever so much before that.""

""Is there nothing else?""

""You mean,"" said Ned, in a subdued tone, ""being what my mother calls
pious.""

""No. I never talk of that; I know nothing about it; wish I did.""

""What _do_ you mean, then?""

""I'll tell you. I don't suppose it is boasting to say that we have been
smart, trusty, and filled the places we were put in, perhaps, as well,
in our way, as they in theirs; but they have done other things that we
have not.""

""What are they?""

""They have done good. Isaac Murch persuaded Peterson to leave liquor
alone, and taught him to read. How Charlie, John, and Fred helped old
Mrs. Yelf after her husband died! and she, with her old fingers, wove
the royal of the Hard-scrabble, and luck has followed that vessel from
the day she was launched. Isaac Murch said he left his luck behind him
when he left the Hard-scrabble; for Seth Warren has made double, in
proportion to the cost of the two vessels, in her to what he has in the
great ship. She has never lost a spar or a man; and it's my belief she
never will be cast away, but die a natural death in the head of Captain
Rhines's Cove, where the squirrels will make nests in her cabin, and
hoard their acorns, the robins will build on her spars, the little
children have her for a play-house, and the big boys to dive from.
Uncle Isaac said he knew just as well before she sailed that she would
be lucky as he did afterwards.""

""Why?""

""Because a robin built her nest on the gammon-knee, under the bowsprit;
and Captain Rhines put off rigging her a week, that the nest might not
be disturbed.""

""I never heard of that before, Walter; but Charlie Bell told me how
much Captain Rhines and Uncle Isaac did for the widow Hadlock.""

""There's one thing he never told you, I'll warrant: that Fred Williams
was once one of the worst boys in town; and he and John reformed him,
took all the money they had earned, and set him up in business.""

""No, he never told me that. At home they praise us, and call us smart.
We risked our lives last voyage, and are ready to risk them again, to
make money.""

""But Captain Rhines, Uncle Isaac, Lion Ben, our Joe, and Charlie Bell
risked their lives to save yours and the captain's.""

""Yes; and see what Captain Rhines has done since for our captain and
his mother's family.""

""You know what Uncle Isaac's last words were, Ned. I shall never forget
them; they keep coming up. 'What I now like most to think about, boys,
ain't what I've done for _myself_, but to help others.'""

""I'm sure, Walter, I feel just so; but I don't know what we can do like
them. If Uncle Isaac was alive, he could tell us.""

""Nor I, either; but I don't mean to wait to do some great thing to make
a sound, but take hold of the first thing that comes up.""

""I'm bound to do what you do, Wal. But come, I'm rested; let's go on.""

Descending the hill to the valley, they beheld a most lively scene.
Men, women, and children were busily employed gathering olives, which
were now ripe, and looked similar to a ripe damson. Some were in the
trees, shaking them from the branches, others beating them off with
poles, and still others picking up and loading upon mules and asses,
which stood near, with wicker panniers across their backs. They were
also loading into the queerest-looking carts imaginable--the wheels
solid, made of two layers of planks, with a short piece on each side to
increase the thickness and the bearing, and take the place of a hub. To
some of these carts oxen were attached, yoked by the horns; and every
time these wheels turned they made a doleful screeching.

""I should think,"" said Ned, ""if they are making oil, they might afford
enough to grease their wheels.""

""So should I. Look at those women, Ned,"" pointing to three who were
bearing off sacks on their shoulders, filled with olives. ""What a way
that is, lading women, and letting asses and mules stand still!""

Great were the surprise and delight of the boys, upon approaching,
to recognize in the peasant who had first attracted their attention
Gabriel Quesnard, with whom they had become quite familiar, as he had
often been to the vessel with eggs, poultry, and vegetables, and the
captain had always invited him to eat with him. It was also from him
they had bought the honey a few days before.

Gabriel welcomed them most warmly. He could speak English fluently,
having had constant intercourse with English and American captains
for many years of his youth, when he was a porter at Marseilles;
nevertheless, he seemed highly gratified when Ned addressed him in the
peculiar dialect of Provence.

""I am most happy to see you, citizens,"" said he. Quesnard was a
thorough radical, a believer in fraternity and equality, and an ardent
member of the very party that had pulled down convents, levelled
distinctions, destroyed the Bastile, executed the king, guillotined
nobles, and turned France upside down. But, for all that, he possessed
a kind and generous nature, and was a most excellent husband and
father. Though without education, he was a shrewd, discerning man,
thoroughly versed in all the local politics and traditions of his
country. If he could neither read nor write, he had nevertheless
thought much, listened well, and observed closely, been a constant
attendant at the assemblies of the people, and an actor in all the
terrible scenes of the first years of the revolution. Like many others
of the more reflective and intelligent portion of the inhabitants
of the southern provinces, he was satisfied when those abominable
extortions, levied upon the peasantry both by clergy and nobles under
the name of ""seignioral rights,"" or, as it was sometimes called, ""the
servitude of the soil,"" were swept away, joined the more moderate
party, who thought blood enough had been shed, and were opposed to the
savage fanatics, who, in the name of liberty, slew all whom they either
hated or feared.

""You find us busy, citizens,"" he said; ""for it is the olive-harvest,
and we are later about it than common; but it is now nearly time to
leave work. You will go with me to my poor house, and pass the night.""

""We thank you kindly,"" said Ned; ""but we are sailors, accustomed to
being out of doors, and all kinds of exposure. After being so long
penned up on shipboard, we wish to stretch our limbs, see the country,
and crops, how the people live, and have made up our minds to sleep on
the side of yonder hill, in this sweet air.""

""It is winter-time, and the nights are long and cool.""

""This weather is summer to us. We came from a country where the winters
are severe. We have blankets, and are used to sleeping on the soft side
of a plank.""

""But your food, citizens.""

""We have plenty of provision in our packs.""

Gabriel not seeming at all reconciled to this, and still urging the
claims of hospitality, Walter told him they wished to go farther to see
the face of the country, productions, and manner in which the people
lived.

""And how can you see in what fashion the people live if you don't go
into their homes, and eat and drink with them?""

""We couldn't see the country in the house,"" replied Walter. ""We will
sleep on the hill-side to-night, to-morrow travel farther to please
ourselves, and, on our return, stop at your house to gratify you.""

""By that time,"" said Gabriel, ""we hope to be more at leisure for
sociability and a good time.""

""I've seen olives before,"" said Walter, ""in Spain, and eaten them; but
they were green. These are violet.""

""That was because they were unripe. These are ripe. I used to sell the
greater part of mine green before the blockade.""

""What do you do to them when you sell them in that way?""

""Soak them ten hours in lye, afterwards a week in cold water, then put
them in brine, with some sweet herbs. That is all. Some only put them
in brine.""

""What are you going to do with these?""

""Press them for oil.""

""What a great tree this is that you are gathering now!"" said Ned.
""Let's see if we can clasp it, Walter.""

Putting their arms around the tree, they were barely able to touch the
tips of their fingers.

""I didn't know olive trees grew so large,"" said Walter. ""None of the
others here are half as large as this. How brown the bark looks! and
great furrows in it, just like an old willow, and the leaves look like
willow leaves. It is hollow, too, and covered with warts.""

""Yes, because it is so old.""

""How old is it?""

""God only knows; perhaps as old as the world.""

""As old as the world?""

""Yes, citizens, it might have been the first one made.""

""The first one made!""

""Well, nobody ever knew one to die, except it was burnt, cut down, or
killed by the frost. They can't bear the frost. A few years ago, most
of the trees in the low ground were hurt by the frost, but this, being
on higher ground, escaped. I don't believe they ever die of their own
accord.""

""How long is it,"" asked Walter, ""after they are planted, before they
bear?""

""They bear a few olives in ten or twelve years, but not much of a crop
till they are twenty-five or thirty.""

""Don't they lose their leaves?""

""A part of the leaves turn yellow, as you see, in the fall, but they
are never bare; and in the spring the new ones push off the old ones.""

""Do they bear every year?""

""No, every other: they work one year for themselves, and one for the
owner.""

""Do they yield much oil?""

""A hundred weight of clean olives makes about thirty or thirty-two
pounds of oil.""

""How much oil will a big tree, like that we have clasped, make?""

""This year that tree has about one hundred and forty livres (pounds).""

""How much oil will they make?""

""About a barrel--twenty of your gallons.""

""What is it worth?""

""Three francs (sixty cents) a gallon; but then we raise other crops
among the olives.""

""But I suppose they are like our crops that we raise in the
orchards--rather light?""

""Yes; but the olive will grow on poor land, endure the drought, and
don't require much care.""

""What do you dress them with?""

""The skins and stones that are left after pressing, are as good as
anything.""

""How much do the other trees average? There are no others near as large
as this.""

""About two gallons, take one year with another. The olives, however,
come off after the grain harvest and the vintage are over, when there
is not much else to do.""

""Taking out the big tree, that wouldn't be more than fifteen dollars
to an acre every other year, according to the number of trees you've
got here, making no allowance for blight and bad years. Then you've no
straw, nothing left but the oil, and that won't keep a great while;
if you don't sell it, cattle can't eat it. I'd rather raise corn on a
burn, where I can get a crop worth five times as much, that I can eat,
sell, or that my cattle will fat on, will keep, and then have a crop
of fodder left after all is done. Do they ever fail of a crop in the
bearing years?""

""Yes, they sometimes blight and cast their fruit.""

""I should call it rather small business to wait twelve years for a tree
to bear at all, then twenty-five or thirty more for it to bear full;
after all, to bear only every other year; sometimes blight, and then
get only six dollars from the very largest trees. I shouldn't think
they'd be worth the picking up.""

""Not worth the picking up!"" cried Gabriel in astonishment; ""_olives not
worth picking up_? They bring much money to the poor man.""

""How much are a man's wages here?""

""Twenty sous (cents) a day, a woman's, ten, to work in the field.""

""Why, in America a man working on the land in harvest gets six or nine
francs, and found.""

""Mon Dieu!"" screamed Gabriel; ""my wife, my children, hear that. Felix
Bertault, my neighbor,"" he shouted to a peasant, who was a short
distance away pruning vines, but, having heard the loud talking and
witnessed the excited gestures caused by Walter's words, stood gaping
with open mouth, and pruning-hook in hand.

""Step this way,"" said Gabriel, ""and listen to what this young citizen
is saying--that in America a laboring man gets nine francs, and his
victuals besides.""

The new comer expressing equal surprise, they talked and gesticulated
with such fury, that Ned whispered to Walter,--

""Do you believe, Wal, that a Frenchman could talk if you tied his
hands?""

""I guess not; Captain Rhines says they couldn't.""

""What kind of trees are those with such crooked limbs?"" asked Ned.

""Mulberries.""

""The bark and body look some like a maple; what are they good for?""

""We use the leaves to feed silkworms.""

""Silkworms,"" said Walter,--""the worms that make silk?""

""Yes; they can't live on anything but mulberry leaves.""

""I want to see them make silk cloth and ribbons.""

Gabriel replied by explaining to Walter that the silk-worm only spun
the threads of silk (which were almost as fine as a spider's thread)
to form a nest or cocoon (as they were called) for itself, and that a
number of these minute threads must be put together to make what is
called a thread of silk, which was then woven in looms, like any other
yarn. As it came from the worm the silk was of two colors,--white and
yellow; the other colors being given by dyeing.

""We have spiders,"" said Ned, ""that make nests. I have found them on
trees; they look like an egg, but more peaked; they were not silk,
though.""

""If,"" said Walter, ""it is the nature of these caterpillars to live in
trees and make houses for themselves, what is the need of bringing them
into the house, as you spoke of, and picking leaves for them? Why
can't you leave them on the trees to take care of themselves, and, when
they have made their houses, go and pick them off?""

Gabriel then explained to the boys that the silk-worm and the mulberry
tree were both natives of a warmer climate than France, where the worm
could live and hatch out of doors, like other worms; and that, although
the mulberry tree had become acclimated, and could live and grow out
of doors, and even sustain a severe winter, the worm couldn't, and
therefore they kept them in the house, and brought the leaves to them;
and when they came to see him, he would take them over to the house of
Felix Bertault, who raised them, show them the cocoons and silk, and
tell them all about it.

Our young readers must not be surprised that Walter thought the worms
made silk ready for use. How should he know anything about it? A good
many boys who read these books may not know any more; those who do,
have obtained their knowledge by reading, and perhaps never saw a
silk-worm in all their lives, although they are raised in Connecticut,
and a few in Massachusetts; but Walter had not access to books that
treated of such matters. Walter now asked the peasant to what the
fragrance of the air was owing; to which he replied that, on the
hills from which the wind then blew, a great many fragrant plants
were growing wild, and also in the fields of his neighbors; they were
cultivated for the purpose of the perfumer; but there was not so much
of that business here as at Nismes, Nice, and Cannes; but still a good
many plants were cultivated and sent to those and other places to be
sold.

""Does anybody own land here, except the nobility? or are the laboring
people all tenants?""

""We have been delivered from all that trash by the revolution; cut off
their heads, or they have fled; we're all nobles now. To answer your
question, citizens, it used to be so in a good measure here. Although
the people owned land, more or less, all over France, yet the most of
it was in the hands of the grand seigniors; and that which the common
people held was so burdened with taxes to be paid the aristocracy,
clergy, and government, that it was better to be without it; but since
the revolution, in consequence of the confiscation of the estates of
the seigniors and priests who were guillotined or emigrated, all that
land was thrown into the market by the National Assembly, divided into
lots, from one to ten acres, sold to the citizens, and five years
allowed to pay for it in.""

""Do you own this land?"" asked Walter.

""What, all this valley?""

""Yes.""

""Citizens, are you mad? No peasant owns so much as that.""

""Why not? A great many persons in my country own more than this whole
valley.""

""A great part of this land,"" said Gabriel, ""belonged to a grand
seignior, some small portions being owned by citizens; but he was
guillotined, his property confiscated, the land parcelled out and
sold, so that it has passed into the hands of the people. Before the
revolution,"" said he, ""the land, at the death of the parent, went
to the oldest son; but that law is abolished, and it is now equally
divided; for which reason, in respect to some small properties, the
children possess only a few rods; sometimes an olive tree, or mulberry,
standing in ten rods of land; and this is the homestead of a whole
family--their farm.""




CHAPTER V.

THE YANKEE BOYS' HOLIDAY IN PROVENCE.


The peasants now began to return to the village, while the boys
prepared to camp out. Walter, at a hasty glance along the side of the
mountain, perceiving many trees, took it for granted, without further
examination, that they were forest trees, and would furnish material
for a fire; but as they approached, to his great chagrin, he noticed
that they were mulberry, olive, and figs, and that there was not even
a bush or a bramble that could be taken to feed a fire. This at once
reversed the whole train of his ideas, and threw him into a state of
mind entirely foreign to his usual cheerful, buoyant frame, and a mood
not to be pleased with anything, which communicated itself, though
with less intensity, to Ned, who, never having experienced those
peculiar emotions begotten of the free wild life in the woods, was not
peculiarly touched by the disappointment.

""I think it is a great way for people who live by their labor to be so
far from their work. I should think it would take half of their time to
go and come.""

""They don't know how to put things ahead with a rush, as we do,"" said
Walter.

""How can a man think much of his time when it's worth only twenty cents
a day?""

""It ain't worth that, for a sou ain't quite a cent. They will work all
day in a half bushel, and don't know how to take advantage of work.
I've heard the captain say that they were once little better than
slaves to the aristocracy, and have been so long used to working at a
slave jog that they keep it up, and always want to huddle together like
a nest of rats.""

While talking they had gained the declivity of the hill, and sat down.

""Only look at that troop, Wal.""

It was, indeed, a curious spectacle, that peasant train,--some
driving asses, others mules, and still others oxen attached to their
queer-looking carts heaped with olives, and all making for the gap
between the hills, through which the boys had seen the church spire.

Spreading their blankets beneath a shelving rock, they rolled
themselves in them, and began to converse.

""How sweet this air smells!"" said Ned, snuffing the odor of the wild
thyme, lavender, marjoram, absinthe, and other fragrant plants among
which they lay.

""I don't think much of it,"" said Walter, who was not in a humor to be
pleased with anything. ""I call it a God-forsaken country, all dried up,
no water to drink without travelling ten miles, and then sucking it out
of the rocks. Here we've passed two or three beds of brooks all dried
up; plenty of water when you don't want it, none when you do; and not a
stick of wood to build a camp fire. This smell is not to be mentioned
in the same day with the fragrance of good pine woods, and I know it
isn't half so wholesome. Give me a good apple orchard in bloom, and you
may have all these miserable herbs.""

""I'm sure,"" said Ned, ""I'd rather have a tumbler of cider than all
their sour wine; and what is an olive to an apple?""

""Yes, Ned, to the cat-heads that grow down behind our pig-sty. They may
talk about the juice of the grape; give me the good maple sirup, and
sap, and a country where a man can earn enough to afford to eat meat.""

""I know it, Walter; and where the women don't have to shovel dirt, hoe,
reap, and work just like an Indian squaw. I twigged that. And then brag
about their politeness!""

""I never heard there was any politeness among the Griffins; but I
wonder what my father would say to see mother shovelling sand, or
lugging manure on her back up the side of a mountain. Guess he'd roar
some; guess she'd have to scud into the house quicker.""

""Did you ever see such pigs?"" said Ned, who was now thoroughly imbued
with the fault-finding humor of his companion. ""Guess they have to boil
their pork; for I don't believe there's grease enough in it to fry
itself.""

""Did you ever see such oxen? They ain't bigger than rats--nasty,
scraggly-looking things, cow-horned and cat-hammed, no necks or
quarters, every hair sticking up straight. Don't believe they could
twitch a spruce bush. I'll bet our old Star and Golding (just let
father speak to 'em) would drag six such, tail foremost. They're
welcome to their silks; I'd rather have mother's fulled cloth than all
their spider's web. They're welcome to their warm weather, vines, figs,
cockroaches, garlic, and all their herbs; give me three feet of snow, a
good log camp, a roaring fire, and game in plenty, and they are welcome
to the almond trees and pot herbs. Goodness! to call three olive trees,
on a bit of ground that I could straddle, a farm. One good fat bear
would make more and better grease than an acre of 'em.""

""What do you suppose they would say, Walter, to see Lion Ben's acres?
and what to the Lion himself?""

""Jerusalem!"" said Walter, borrowing one of his brother Joe's by-words;
""only let him get into one of his rages, and he would slay the whole
country with the jaw-bone of an ass.""

""Well,"" said Ned, who felt that a good part of Walter's spleen arose
from the lack of the camp fire he had anticipated. ""They all seemed
very kind, you know; and Gabriel asked and urged us to go to his house.""

""Yes; to be eaten up with fleas and ten thousand bugs and stinging
concerns they have here.""

Thus growling and grumbling, Walter fell asleep. The last words
distinguishable were, ""God-forsaken country; no wood for a camp fire.""

In the morning, as the result of a consultation held while eating, they
determined first to ascend the hill, and afterwards to explore the
country. Here they found a long moss on the rocks, which they concluded
would be just the thing with which to fill their beds, and resolved to
take some of it with them when they returned.

""O, Wal, we'll dry some of these fragrant plants, and mix with the
moss.""

""Yes; that will be nice.""

Following a cart track through a gap in the hills, they came upon a
highway in most excellent order, and bordered with trees, and saw, a
little upon their left, the village of the peasants, consisting of
houses built of mud and stone huddled together, many without glass, and
no entrance for light except the door, the roofs covered with tiles,
and not a tree near them.

Their attention was attracted by the towers of a large castle,
evidently in ruins, upon the summit of an eminence that commanded the
village. With curiosity greatly excited, they were about to climb the
hill to view it more closely, when Ned said, ""Let us go ahead, see the
country, come back here to-night, and camp in the ruins.""

Skirting the base of the hill upon which the castle stood, they came
again upon the stream that watered the vale,--now increased in volume
by affluents from the mountains,--falling over a cliff upon which
were the remnants of a dam, and just below it a mass of half-burned
timber and large stones, that Walter, more familiar than Ned with such
matters, declared to be the ruins of some kind of a mill. These large
circular stones lay embedded in a mass of coals and brands, the shafts
burned out of them, white from the action of fire, and every one split
in two. It seemed probable this had been accomplished by flinging water
upon them while red hot.

There was no water, at this time, within several rods of the stones;
but, from the appearance of the banks, it was evident that the stream,
since the destruction of the dam, had changed its channel, and had once
flowed near to the stones, to which it had been brought in a flume, the
remains being still visible. After inspecting these stones with the
greatest curiosity, Walter said,--

""I don't see what they could grind with such stones as these; they
certainly couldn't grind grain; they couldn't _grind_ anything; they
are not 'picked,' like a millstone, but as smooth as my hand; they
could only squat. If they raised apples here, I should think they were
made to squat them.""

Our young readers will bear in mind that mill-stones are ""picked,"" or
cut in sweeping furrows, which leave sharp edges to catch and grind the
grain.

Still farther from the bank of the stream, on some high and level
ground, were two more pairs of stones. These, it was evident, had not
been enclosed in any building, as the only cinders lying around were
those resulting from the burning of the shafts that had once been used
to operate them. The lower stones were raised about two feet from the
ground, and dishing nearly ten feet in diameter, with holes drilled
through them, around a central one. Upon these lay two smaller stones,
with square holes in their centres, in one of which was a half-burned
shaft. These were all, save one upper stone, split in halves.

""How did they split these?"" asked Ned. ""They have not been heated.""

""With powder,"" said Walter, pointing to holes drilled in the stones.

""Then why didn't they split this one?""

""They tried to, but the charge blew out; there are the holes.""

""Perhaps their powder gave out.""

""I guess I know how this went.""

""How?""

""This stone ran on its edge round the other; there was an upright
shaft in the middle; and that hole in the centre was made to receive
a pintle, to hold the foot of it, and it was turned by a horse, or by
hand, just like a cider mill.""

Walter began to hunt in the long grass around the stone, and soon
exclaimed,--

""Here it is! here is the track worn into the ground, where somebody or
something travelled.""

""It was a horse or mule,"" said Ned, holding up a rusty shoe.

""That is too big for the foot of an ass.""

""What is the stone trough underneath for, Wal?""

""To catch whatever ran from the mill. It must have been liquid, for
nothing else could go through these holes.""

""It is very strange,"" said Ned, ""that these people should set to work
and plant trees along the highways, and not put so much as one tree,
rosebush, or even a lilac, around their own houses.""

Although not aware of it, they were now among a people to whom those
peculiar feelings which in the mind of the Anglo-Saxon are connected
with home and the domestic hearth, are unknown. Had they been aware
that these splendid roads, ornamented with magnificent trees, and so
skilfully laid out as to present the most picturesque and imposing
scenery to the eye of the traveller, were all constructed and kept in
order by means of the dreaded ""_corvée_,""--compulsory labor, which
signified that the poor peasant might be taken from his work to labor
on the public roads, and, should he chance to offend a capricious
master, even in time of harvest, to leave the bread of his household to
waste in the field,--they would have ceased to wonder that the wretched
peasant, burdened with a thousand exactions and goaded to despair,
should be rather disposed to brood over his wrongs, and nurse the hope
of vengeance, than to embellish a dwelling which, in the great majority
of instances, was not his own.

Determining to follow the course of the stream, rather than the
highway, they had proceeded but a short distance, when they reached a
spot, where, divided by a mass of rock, it encircled a level island of
about three acres, entirely covered with a growth of rods as smooth
and pointed as a bulrush. They were planted in regular rows, with
great care, were eight or ten feet in height, perfectly straight, and
entirely destitute of leaves or limbs, except that in some instances
there was a fork at the top.

""What can these be?"" asked Ned.

""I don't know; let's see if we can't find a place where we can wade
across.""

Following the stream till abreast the middle of the island, they
espied a row of stepping-stones, upon which they crossed, and, finding
a peasant at work, he informed them that they were ""osiers,"" anglice
sallows, and were used to make hampers for wine, cover bottles and
demijohns, and tie vines to the stakes, were made into chairs and
playthings for children, and that a great many, after being divested of
their bark, were exported to New York.

""Why, Walter,"" said Ned, ""these are the very things Mr. Bell made
baskets of, that he and Charlie called sallies. I heard him ask the
captain to get him some rods, and tell him that if he put them in
earth or wet moss in the vessel's hold, they would grow by being stuck
down, when the vessel got home.""

""Then we will get a lot for him.""

They asked the peasant, who told them the rods must be cut into
pieces, seven or eight inches long, that in two years they would yield
something, and in three a good crop of rods.

""Charlie has a splendid place to plant them on,"" said Ned, ""right on a
little flat by the mouth of the brook.""

""Yes,"" said Walter, ""but here are willows ten feet high. Mr. Bell
carried no willows like these.""

The peasant told him the reason that these grew so remarkably, was,
that in the spring and fall the stream overflowed its banks, leaving a
rich slime, which fertilized the soil, and the island, being surrounded
by water, was moist throughout the year, and that the largest he was
then cutting were used to hoop wine casks.

On the other side of the little isle was a rude bridge, upon which
they crossed to the opposite shore. Following the course of the stream
over heaps of gravel mixed with stones, brought down by streams from
the mountains in the spring floods, they proceeded for miles through
the most monotonous, dreary scenery imaginable; not a tree, bush, or
scarcely a blade of grass to relieve the eye, Walter often repeating
his favorite expression, ""a God-forsaken country.""

At length, as the sun attained its meridian, the face of the country
became more diversified, breaking into gentle swells, and even hills
of moderate elevation. Here they met with a little brook, which wound
among the hills, and fell into the stream with a grateful murmur. Its
banks were margined with a broad belt of green grass, and fringed with
bushes and small trees, many of them evergreens.

""This is excellent water,"" said Ned, as he stooped and drank. ""Suppose
we eat here.""

""I wouldn't; let us follow the stream into the valley I see yonder,
eat, and rest there, and then go back.""

They were led to a glen, the banks of which, broken into irregular,
gentle slopes, were clothed with groves of large trees entirely clear
of underbrush. Flinging themselves at the roots of a massive tree
standing by itself at the extremity of a slight elevation, around which
the brook wound, and where the sun shone warm and pleasantly, they
began leisurely to eat, till, the demands of appetite appeased, they
stretched themselves upon the grass.

""Wonder what kind of trees these are,"" said Ned; ""guess they are
walnuts.""

""They look more like oaks,"" said Walter.

""Well, so they are,"" said Ned, who, lying on his back, was looking up
through the branches, ""for I see an acorn.""

""Here is another I've found on the ground. What a funny acorn! The cup
comes half way over it.""

Near by them was a rude building open at the sides, and with thatched
roof.

""I'm going to see what is in that building, Wal."" And going to it, he
cried out, ""Come here; it is half full of great sheets of cork.""

""So it is, Ned; and these are cork trees, you may depend."" Trying the
bark with their knives, they found it to be the fact.

""O, my! I'm so glad we came! Only think how much we have learned
to-day; and we've got the old castle to see when we go back.""

""I never thought before,"" said Walter, ""that a cork tree was an oak,
and bore acorns.""

Returning, they re-crossed the island.

""How old,"" asked Walter of the peasant, ""must a cork tree be, before
they can take off the cork?""

""Twenty years; after that, they take it every ten years, but the cork
is not of the best quality till the third stripping.""

""Don't it injure the tree?""

""No more than it does you to peel the dead skin from your hands; only
the live bark beneath must not be injured.""

""What time of year do they peel it?""

""July and August.""

""How do they get it off?""

""They first pound the tree to loosen the dead bark from the live, then
make two up and down cuts the whole length of the body of the tree,
then cross-cuts about three feet apart, and remove the bark with a
wedge.""

""That,"" said Walter, ""is the way we peel hemlock bark in America; only
we cut the trees down, and don't beat the bark.""

""What else do they do to it?"" asked Ned.

""They scorch it to close the grain, and warp it straight, then put on
rocks to keep it so till it gets set (like that you saw in the hovel),
when it is ready to sell.""

As they went on, Walter said, ""I shouldn't think a man in this country
would ever have courage enough to commence farming.""

""Why not?""

""Because you must wait twelve years for an olive tree, twenty for a
cork, and forty before the bark is first rate. Give me New England,
where, with nothing under heavens but his rifle and narrow axe, a man
can raise his bread on a burn the first year, knock up a log hut, and
have his meat for the killing.""

""And wood enough for a camp fire,"" said Ned, laughing.




CHAPTER VI.

THE POWER OF ASSOCIATION.


As the boys returned by the same road, which presented no new objects
to excite their curiosity, much less time was consumed in measuring the
same distance; and they ascended the eminence upon which the castle was
situated, and stood before its principal entrance long before night.

It was one of the few old feudal strongholds still remaining in France
that had not been suffered to go to decay by its possessors. It had
been the property of a grand seignior (derived from his ancestors),
who, having built a modern chateau near it, with extensive stables
and other out-buildings, kept the old castle in complete repair, till
sacked by a mob during the reign of terror.

It had evidently been a place of great strength, but occupying so much
space that a large garrison would be required to man its exterior
fortifications. It was beautifully situated upon a noble swell of
land, falling away in natural terraces to the stream upon whose banks
were clustered the dwellings of the peasants. The hand of violence had
swept away all but the relics of its former magnificence and beauty.
The axe had levelled the vast groves and long avenues of oak, chestnut,
beech, and massive pines,--which had for ages delighted the eye and
gratified the taste, and beneath whose hoary limbs generations had
lived and died,--except one clump of large pines, at some distance in
the rear of the fortress.

Everything without the walls that would burn had been consumed by fire,
while the tall chimney of the chateau, and other buildings standing
amid heaps of rubbish, the wild weeds springing from the joints of the
hearth-stones, imparted a peculiarly desolate appearance to the scene.

Gunpowder had been freely used to obtain an entrance into the fortress,
and afterwards to destroy it; but such was the enormous thickness of
the walls that but comparatively little impression had been produced
upon them, although single apartments had been blown up and whole
floors had fallen, the pillars which supported them having been mined.
Entire floors, supported at one end by the beams, which still remained
in the walls, and a few pillars, while the remaining portion lay upon
heaps of rubbish, bricks, mortar, fragments of clothes, domestic
utensils, curved frames, broken china and glass ware of the rarest
patterns and the richest colors, presented an inclined plane, up which
the boys clambered to the apartments above, passing through chambers
once the abode of luxury, but from whose walls the rich tapestry
hung in tatters, exposed to sun and wind, that found free entrance
through shattered casements and demolished doors. The boys gazed with
wonder upon the relics of a magnificence of which they had before no
conception.

The most singular spectacle awaited them in the great hall of the
castle, which they now entered. Nothing remained undisfigured here
except the lofty arches of the roof, with its beautiful fret-work, the
carving on the capitals and some portions of the windows, by reason of
their height difficult to reach.

The walls had been adorned with ancestral portraits of the former
inhabitants of the castle and the old French nobility, with banners and
suits of armor, statues in marble and bronze, paintings and copies of
paintings by the greatest masters; but they were now torn from their
places, pierced with bullets, and battered with rocks and clubs; for,
in consequence of one of those caprices which sometimes influence the
conduct of a mob even in the midst of the wildest excitement, they had
abstained from using fire _within_ the walls, while they had burned
everything combustible _outside_, although many of the timbers and much
of the panel-work bore traces of the peasants' axes, undoubtedly cut
for fire-wood.

In the midst of this spacious hall was a vast collection of articles
which appeared to have been brought from all parts of the castle and
flung here in indiscriminate confusion; marble statues, paintings,
ancient armor, antlers of stags, hunting implements, and flags from old
battle-fields.

Walter sat down upon a marble statue of a chieftain in armor, from
which the left arm and shield had been broken, and the face flattened.

Ned placed himself on a pile of gilded frames of large paintings he had
thrown together, and thus seated they surveyed at leisure the fretted
roof, and whatever of interest and beauty had escaped the fury of the
assailants.

The nearest approach to ornamental carving Walter had ever seen before
was the plain panel-work with which Uncle Isaac ceiled up the rooms
he finished, the cornice round the tops of the rooms, beneath the
mantel-piece, and on the front stairs; but these consisted of only four
little flutings with a gouge, a simple bead with a moulding-plane,
or a succession of little squares made with a saw and finished up
with a jack-knife. He had also seen faces of cats on the cat-heads of
vessels, sheaves of wheat and vine-leaves carved on their sterns. Ned
had also seen these, and in addition some more ambitious efforts, in
the old meeting-house at Salem, on the sounding-board, the base, and
surroundings of the pulpit. But here they gazed upon oaken panels,
displaying the most beautiful designs in the highest style of ancient
or modern art; upon tapestry most beautifully wrought, fitted to adorn
regal halls, bleaching in the wind, rent and disfigured; picked from
the rubbish fragments of porcelain vases, bowls, and drinking-cups, of
elaborate design and rare finish.

""I mean to carry these home,"" said Ned, culling from the heap a portion
of a broken vase, and a large pane from one of the windows, upon which
was represented the Saviour in the act of healing the withered hand.

""And I this,"" said Walter, holding up a panel upon which were carved
Laocoon and his sons, writhing in the folds of the snakes.

""Look at that window,"" said Ned; ""only six panes of glass left, and two
thirds of the sash gone.""

""This sight,"" said Walter, ""reminds me of stories I have heard Monsieur
Vimont, my French teacher at Salem, tell. He said the mob attacked
the chateaux and castles of the nobles, murdered their possessors, or
dragged them to prison, except such as were able to save themselves by
flight.""

Walter, who sympathized with the refugees, and listened to his recital
of the terrible scenes through which they had passed, was much
prejudiced in favor of the nobility and against their assailants.

As they followed along the walls, noticing the shattered windows and
the positions from which the paintings and statuary had been torn, they
came to a place from which a very large painting of a knight templar
in full armor had been thrown, and lay defaced upon the floor. Lying
upon this, grinding up the gilded frame, and breaking the canvas, was
one of the large stones of the wall. This stone had once been hung upon
massive hinges, now broken.

Through the opening it had once closed a flight of stairs was visible,
constructed in the thickness of the wall by an arrangement of the
stones at the time of building, and which led to the foundation of the
castle.

Ned was burning with impatience to enter the opening and see whither
the stairs led; but Walter, naturally interested in everything of a
mechanical nature, would not proceed till he had ascertained the method
by which an entrance was effected. He found the whole painting had been
raised by hidden weights, and, by the pressure of a spring adroitly
concealed in the frame, was elevated sufficiently to permit of passing
under it, when by the pressure of another spring the stone was set free
and sprung outwards, affording an entrance, after which, by concealed
mechanism, the whole was restored as before. When he had mastered the
principle of the machinery, they descended the stairs, from the bottom
of which a winding passage led to a corridor from which several doors
opened into vaulted chambers dimly lighted by slits in the walls. Some
of them appeared to have been used as dungeons, ring-bolts, with chains
attached, being secured to the walls.

As they proceeded they came to another door admitting to a winding
passage-way, entirely dark; but, their curiosity being excited, they
continued to grope their way, carefully placing one foot in advance,
and dragging the other after, lest they might stumble into some pit.

At length Ned, who led the way, suddenly stopped and gave back.

""What is the matter, Ned? What are you stopping for?""

""Walter,"" he exclaimed in a half whisper, ""there's something here,
under my feet. I've put my hand on it, and I believe it's some dead
man; there's something feels like clothes and buttons.""

""Drag it out to where it's lighter; or let me, if you don't like to.""

""Do you think I'm afraid?""

Ned began to step backward, dragging the object after him, while Walter
threw open the doors leading to the vaults. By the glimmering of light
thus obtained, they beheld the skeleton of a human body, held together
by the articulations of the joints, the clothes, dried gristle, and
sinews, being partially mummified.

Neither of the boys had ever seen the human skeleton before, or even
so much as a bone, and this was to them a fearful sight--the teeth
white and prominent, the eyeless sockets, and the remaining portion
of the skull black with decayed flesh that still adhered to it (for
the air was cool and dry, ventilation being in some way provided). The
right hand had dropped off, the stump of the wrist projecting from the
sleeve, while the blackened bones and shrivelled sinews of the left
remained in place.

""It was a boy,"" said Ned; ""you can see by the clothes.""

""Poor fellow, he was about your size.""

""His hair,"" said Ned, pointing to some brown locks that had lodged in
the breast of the coat, ""was just the color of yours. Think he was
murdered?""

""I expect so, for it don't seem likely that a place as strong as this
was given up without a struggle, unless it was occupied only by a
family, or was surprised.""

""Then, perhaps, there's more in there.""

""Let us try to make some kind of a torch. I want to see all there is,
and to find where this secret passage leads to that so much pains was
taken to make and conceal.""

Returning, the boys hunted over the great heap of rubbish in the hall,
and searched every nook and corner in order to find a lamp or wax
candle (which they knew were much used in that country), but in vain.

""O, if we were only at home,"" said Walter, ""instead of being in this
wretched country, how quick I could get a piece of pitch wood, or strip
the bark from a birch tree, and make a first-rate torch; but there are
no birches here, and no old pines with any pitch wood in 'em.""

""But we shouldn't have any castles there to see,"" said Ned.

At last they found an iron pot, and resolved to build a fire in that,
and carry it as a torch.

While they were breaking up pieces of dry wood for that purpose, Ned
exclaimed, ""Who knows but olive wood will burn well. I should think it
would be full of oil.""

""Perhaps it will.""

They broke some branches from the trees, and put them in the pot with
pine slivers from old panels. Walter took a horn full of tinder from
his pack, and, holding it between his knees, with an old file and
flint-stone struck the sparks into the horn till he ignited the tinder
sufficiently to light a brimstone match, and kindled his fire in the
pot, when they found that the olive wood burned freely, lasted longer,
and afforded a better light, than the pine or oak; therefore they
procured more of it.

""Now for something to carry it with,"" said Ned; ""and here it is,""
pulling a long iron rod from the pile of miscellaneous articles that
strewed the floor.

""And here is something to hold a supply of wood,"" said Walter, picking
up a steel helmet and filling it with the chips.

With the kettle of blazing brands between them, they proceeded to
explore the passage.

The first object that arrested their attention (and almost touching a
door, through the grates of which a fresh current of air, fragrant with
the scent of the earth and fields, was blowing) was the skeleton of an
aged man. The skull had been cleft by some sharp weapon; long locks of
gray hair strewed the floor, and across the breast of the skeleton lay
that of a dog, the fore paws outstretched, and the nose thrust among
the clothes that covered the breast.

""O, Walter,"" cried Ned, the tears springing to his eyes, ""what a sight!""

""The saddest sight I ever saw. That dog starved to death because he
would not leave his master.""

""I shall always love a dog after this.""

""They are noble creatures. Did you ever see what was on Tige Rhines's
collar?""

""About his taking the little girl from the mill pond?""

""Yes; and that is not all he did; he saved the lives of John, Charlie
Bell, and Fred Williams, by waking them up when they were asleep in a
cave into which the tide was flowing.""

""This must be that boy's father,"" said Ned. ""Or his grandfather,""
replied Walter. ""He was murdered, at any rate,"" pointing to the cloven
skull.

""See here, Wal,"" holding a brand close to the floor; ""see the blood all
dried on the stones.""

""Poor old man, cut down with his hand almost on the door! That door
leads out, for I can smell the fresh air, and feel it warm on my cheek.
Let's see if we can open it, Wal.""

The upper part of the door was grated. They shook it, and exerted
themselves to the utmost to wrench it open, but without success.

""Hold up a brand, Ned; perhaps I can find a fastening.""

Walter searched carefully, but in vain, for any lock, bolt, or other
fastening.

""If I only had a sledge, or hammer, and cold chisel, I'd cut these
grates off, short notice.""

""I saw a crowbar outside, among some garden tools,"" said Ned.

""Get it; that's the thing.""

Walter plied the bar upon the grates till the sparks flew from the
iron, and the sweat dropped from his forehead; but it resisted his
efforts.

""Let me spell you, Wal.""

""Try the wood below, Ned.""

""It is oak, and studded with iron; but I'll try it.""

After a few blows, the door flew open of its own accord. Ned, by a
random stroke, had moved the spring.

""That's good luck, Ned. Go ahead.""

They soon encountered another similar door.

""Now, Ned, I'm just going back to look at that spring.""

By the knowledge thus obtained, Walter was enabled to detect a similar
spring in this door, though in a different place.

They now began to perceive the light, and came to a horizontal grate,
which was unfastened, and reached by only two steps. Walter flung
it back, and they crawled out on their hands and knees beneath an
overhanging cliff (through which the passage was cut), and into a
tangle of wild vines that clung to the cliffs, weeds, brambles, and
shrubs, effectually concealing the passage from casual observation.

""Whoever built this,"" said Ned, ""knew how to make secret passages. One
might pass this place all his lifetime, and never suspect it.""

""It didn't do them much good,"" said Walter. ""I'd rather live in a
country where they are not needed. Ned, don't you think we ought to put
this father and son in the ground?""

""I was thinking of that.""

""What can we find to dig a grave with?""

""When I went after the crowbar, I found it among a lot of garden
tools; there were shovels, rakes, and hoes, but the handles were all
burnt away.""

""No matter; we'll bury them in the old garden, where the ground is
mellow; we can make a hole with the bar, and throw out the loose earth
with the shovel-blades, if they _have_ no handles.""

A shallow grave was soon dug in the soft mould.

""We buried a man from the Madras,"" said Ned; ""he was sewed up in
canvas.""

""We lost the second mate when I was in the Casco,"" said Walter; ""he was
buried ashore, and we put the American flag on the coffin for a pall.
Suppose we should wrap their bones in these flags taken from the walls;
they are their country's flags.""

""I suppose they would like it if they could know it, and would rather
lie here, where the nightingales will sing in the summer, than in that
dark alley.""

They carefully gathered the bones, wrapped them in the tattered
banners, and committed them to the earth.

""What shall we do with the dog, Walter?""

""Do with him? Bury him with them.""

""In the same grave?""

""To be sure; at their feet. He was the best and only friend they had,
and died on his master's breast; he is worthy to sleep in marble.""

""Well, I feel just so; but I didn't know.""

The sun was just sinking behind the horizon, and his last lingering
rays fell, as it were, in benediction upon the boys, as, feeling the
necessity of instant preparation for the night, they hastened from the
spot. Admonished by the approaching twilight, they went rapidly from
room to room, in order to select one suited to their purpose.

""Let us go out of this hall,"" said Ned, ""into God's air, and get clear
of rubbish, musty walls, and dead men's bones.""

""Yes, into that clump of pines. I had rather lug the wood, and be out
of doors.""

It was not long before they heaped together a great pile of oaken
beams, boards, picture-frames, broken furniture, and panels, and,
seated by the ruddy blaze, were enjoying a hearty meal, till, full even
to repletion, they seated themselves with their backs against a tree to
enjoy the grateful warmth of the fire.

The rising moon began to silver the lofty towers of the ancient
castle, and quivered on the stream, visible at different points between
the cottages of the peasants, while the rush of water, pouring through
the rents of the broken dam, rose on the air. Not a breath of wind
stirred the foliage. The only sounds, contesting with the murmur of
waters the empire of the night, were the crackling of the fire and the
occasional bleat of a sheep on the mountain. It is singular to what an
extent peculiar states of feeling impart a tinge, sombre or otherwise,
to impressions produced by surrounding objects and events.

As Walter sat thus, with the crackling of the fire in his ear, and the
ruddy blaze playing on his cheek, he said,--

""I think this is a nice country, after all; rather dry, to be sure;
a good deal of waste land, covered with gravel and stones brought
down from the mountains. We have seen some beautiful valleys of most
excellent land. The people are kind and hospitable, and, if they were
not so shiftless, might, with their climate and soil, raise two crops a
year. What are you thinking about, Ned?""

""About what my mother would say, if she knew I was making a fire of
mahogany chairs, looking-glass frames, harpsichords, and carved work.
I wonder if any boy ever did that before.""

""Perhaps some soldiers have.""

After this they sat some time, hand clasped in hand, and each occupied
with his own thoughts.

""I should like to know what you are thinking about, Wal.""

""You see that little cove the river has eaten out of the bank?""

""You mean where the moonlight is shining on that large rock, and beside
which a tree is growing?""

""That is the spot. Well, the Saturday afternoon before I was going
to sea for the first time, in the Madras, I went to the catechising,
because I knew that I should find all the boys and girls there, and I
wanted to bid them good by. After that I kept on to Charlie Bell's. It
was a moonlight evening, just like this; and after supper we went to
the head of Pleasant Cove, sat down, and leaned our backs against an
oak, just as you and I are leaning against this pine. We could hear the
brook that runs through his field, behind us, just as we can hear this
stream below, and the ripple of the tide as it crept along the beach.
I felt tender that night, for I loved Charlie Bull dearly. You know,
Ned, how a boy feels, if he does want to go, when the time comes.""

""_That I do._ When he's thinking about going, longing to be off, and
his folks trying to put him off the notion, then he's all stirred
up, and only thinks about getting away; but, when they've given
their consent, he has signed the articles, packed his chest, got his
protection at the Custom house, is sure of going, and all is settled,
then, if he has a good home, and any soul in him, it will give him the
heartache to say good by. There never was a boy more crazy to go to sea
than I was--counting the days till the vessel was ready. She lay in the
stream, ready to sail in the morning. After supper the second mate took
me and three men whom he could trust, and went ashore. We were ordered
to be down to the boat at nine o'clock. It was seven when I reached
home. Didn't those two hours go quick as I sat on the sofa in the
parlor, between father and mother, and my sisters before me. When the
bell rang for nine, and I got up to start for the beach, I didn't feel
altogether so keen for going as I did the week before.""

""That was what I meant. I felt just so that night, while Charlie and
I sat together at the head of Pleasant Cove, beneath the oak, and he
talked to me.""

""What did he say?""

""A great many things. He wanted me to love God and pray to him; he said
there would be nights at sea when the moon would be shining on the
ocean, just as it was then upon the waters of that cove; that he should
look at it and think of me; hoped I would look at it and think of him
and his words; and that as the same planets were above us, so the same
God was around our daily paths; that perhaps when I thought that some
dear friend I loved much was thinking of and praying for me, I should
feel I ought to pray for myself.""

""Have you never thought of it before to-night?""

""Thought of it? Yes, truly. On many a bright moonlight night, when you
and I have been pacing the deck together, have I been occupied with
those memories. You may think it strange, but they were in my mind when
the shot from that English ship of the line was flying round us; but
the moon shining on the water in that little bight, the sound of the
stream, as we sit against this pine, and perhaps what we have just been
doing, bring it home as never before.""

""I love you, Wal,"" said Ned, laying his head in his friend's lap.

""Tell me some news; I knew that before,"" said Walter, patting his cheek.

""I have thought a good many times, lately, that you didn't seem as
you used to. I never heard you say anything about doing good till
this voyage; before, it was always getting rich and rushing things. I
suppose it was because he talked with you, made you have this feeling.""

""I don't know; I always had something of it; always admired it in
Charlie Bell and Uncle Isaac, and longed to do something--I didn't know
what--that was not altogether for myself.""

""Have you ever done what Charlie asked you to that night?""

""What? Pray to God?""

""Yes.""

""No; I only say my prayers when I turn in; don't you?""

""No, I never was brought up to. Will you say the Lord's prayer with me,
Ned?""

""Shall we kneel?""

They knelt together between the roots of the pine, after which they
replenished the fire, rolled themselves in their blankets, and were
soon asleep.




CHAPTER VII.

YANKEE INGENUITY AMONG THE PEASANTS.


In the morning, after eating and still further exploring the different
apartments of the castle, they bent their steps towards the village of
the peasants.

""Would you mention to Gabriel what we found in the secret passage?""
asked Ned.

""I don't think I should. I expect he knows more about it than we do.""

They found Gabriel and his neighbors all busily engaged. Some were
bruising the olives in large mortars; others were treading them
in tubs. There was oil everywhere, and the odor was anything but
agreeable. Others, after placing the bruised pulp in sacks made of
grass or rushes, carried them to the second story of a building, and,
placing the sacks in the middle of the floor, piled great stones upon
them, which pressed the oil through holes bored in the floor, and it
was received in vessels beneath. In consequence of this slow method
of procedure, a large portion of the olives was likely to decay before
they could be pressed, while not more than half the oil was extracted.
As the weight of the stones did not sufficiently compress the pulp,
much of it was wasted on the floor, and still more was lost in being
soaked up by the multitude of different vessels in which the olives
were trampled. This did not, however, obtain in respect to those
bruised in the mortars, which were stone.

Gabriel conducted the boys from one building to another, and showed
them the olives, belonging to different peasants, which were spread
over the floors, where women and little children were picking out the
leaves, stones, and decayed ones.

""Why don't you have a mill to grind these olives?"" asked Walter, ""and
screws to press the pulp? A great part of them will rot before you can
bruise them in this way; besides, you don't get half the oil, to say
nothing of what is wasted, or of the time lost.""

Gabriel told them that before the revolution there were mills and
presses--the property of the grand seignior--in which all the olives of
the peasants were ground and pressed; but they were destroyed at that
time.

""Then that was what those stones were used for that we saw on the bank
of the river?""

""Yes.""

""But what were those for that lie so far from the stream, on the high
ground?""

""They were turned by a horse or mule, or by a number of men. We used
those before the rains came to raise the stream so the mill could work.
It is often very dry here in the autumn.""

""Why don't you all turn to and build them up again, and use them in
company?""

""We have no workmen; they have been conscripted, and are in the army,
except a blacksmith, who was left to shoe the cattle and sharpen the
plough-irons.""

""Is there no stone-cutter? Why don't you make some mill-stones? I'm
sure there are rocks enough. All turn to together, and at least set the
smaller mills a-going, instead of working in this childish fashion.""

The peasant scratched his head, and said, ""The stone-cutter has been
conscripted.""

""Did you have a carpenter?""

""Yes.""

""Was he drafted?""

""What is that?""

""Conscripted.""

""Yes.""

""What became of his tools?""

""He sold them in Marseilles to get bread for his children.""

""In my country we are not tied to mechanics, because it is a new
country, and they are scarce; but when a man wants a thing, he must set
his brains at work and make it, or do without it. How did that concern
on the high ground work?""

""The smaller stone, lying on top, went round the other, and was turned
by a mule.""

""Guess I know. It was rigged just like Uncle John Godsoe's mill that
he ground bark with. A stone ran edgeways on a plank floor, and they
shoved the pieces of bark under the stone. Who do the castle and the
land round it belong to now?""

""It was confiscated and sold by the National Assembly. Felix Bertault
owns the land where the mill stood, and two other peasants, Tonnelot
and Bernard, the castle and the rest of the land.""

""Then it was their wood we burned last night. I will pay them for it.""

""That is nothing.""

""Look here, old friend,"" said Walter, slapping Gabriel on the shoulder.
""I am not a mechanic, but all my breed of people can handle tools.
I can set that old affair going again, and better than ever it went
before; the upper stone is whole, and though the lower one is gone,
I can lay a wooden platform. There's timber enough, and the best of
timber, in the old castle, and though not equal to a water-mill, it
will be an everlasting sight better than your mules, and you can use
them while I am doing it, if you like. I can fix a press, too, that
will get about all the oil from the pulp.""

""But, citizen, you have no tools.""

""There are tools enough on board the vessel, and I ground them a few
days ago. Go among your neighbors, and see what they say to it.""

Gabriel was in raptures, and ran to tell the peasants. He soon
returned, saying that every man, woman, and child were overjoyed, would
do all they could to aid; that the carpenter's apprentice was left, and
proffered his services.

""That is first rate,"" said Walter. ""Now, Ned, you must go to the
vessel and get the tools. Be sure you get a cross-cut saw, and ask the
captain to lend us the tackle and fall we get the anchors on to the
bows with.""

Ned was soon mounted on a cart with Gosset (Gabriel's son), as Ned
didn't know how to drive a mule that might take a notion to stop when
half way there, and they set off.

Nimble hands and plenty of carts soon transported the old floor beams
and oak plank (which Walter selected) to the spot. The gate posts made
capital sills, upon which he laid his platform at the same height from
the ground as the bottom stone of the old mill, in order that the
trough for receiving the oil might go under it.

The apprentice, Raffard, proved to be a good workman, and Gosset also
evinced a decided mechanical ability. Ned, too, could use tools quite
well.

""That boy,"" said Walter to Gabriel, ""only wants instruction and
practice to make a first-rate mechanic.""

There was no lack of iron bolts in the strong-hold, and the blacksmith
made all the iron-work necessary. An upright shaft was prepared, to be
placed in the centre of the platform, which, supported by cross-beams
attached to posts set in the ground, revolved on iron pintles, which
entered the platform and the cross-beam above.

Walter now took a narrow strip of board, seven feet long, bored a hole
in one end, and slipped it over an iron pin placed in the hole in the
centre of the platform, which was jointed together perfectly tight, and
somewhat dishing, with holes to permit the drainage to escape into the
trough; in the other end he drove a pointed nail, and with it swept a
circle on the platform; around this scratch he fayed pieces of plank to
confine the pulp. The diameter of the horse-track was eighteen feet.

It was wonderful, and excited the surprise of Walter and Ned, to
witness the instantaneous change wrought in the appearance of the
peasants. They were now all energy and activity, seemed completely to
have laid aside their listless, lounging attitudes, and manifested a
fertility of resource that the boys never supposed pertained to them.

""All these people want,"" said Walter to Ned, ""is opportunity. They are
smart, only give them a chance.""

It was night by the time Walter had made a horizontal shaft, which was
to run through a square hole in the centre of the edge-stone.

The boys took supper at the house of Gabriel, but notwithstanding his
entreaties to pass the night with him, preferred their camp fire,
although they gladly accepted the present of a pair of chickens, a
dozen eggs from Felix Bertault, honey from Tonnelot, and potatoes from
Leroux. Indeed, the entire community were ready to place their all at
the disposal of these young republicans, in whose energy, ingenuity,
and self-reliance, they flattered themselves they beheld mirrored the
future of their own children under the operation of the principles of
liberty, fraternity, and equality they had so recently inaugurated. As
they separated, Walter told Gabriel that all except Raffard, Gosset,
and Felix, had better keep at work among the olives after their old
fashion, as, the stuff being all on the spot, they were as many as
could work to advantage on the mill, and the others could be called for
a hard lift. They now set out for the castle.

""Won't we have a tuck-out to-morrow morning?"" said Ned. ""I guess
there's no lack of pots and kettles among the ruins of the chateau.
That one we carried the brands in will be first rate; it's all burnt
out clean.""

While Ned was making a fire, Walter was walking round among the woods
on the side of the hill, apparently searching for something. When he
returned, he found a blazing fire at the old spot, but Ned nowhere
visible.

""Ned, where are you?""

""Here, Wal; only come here.""

Following the direction of the voice, he found Ned on his knees before
the kitchen fireplace of the chateau, the chimney of which was still
standing. He was surrounded by old pots and kettles, one of which he
was busily engaged in scouring. He had also placed the wood on the old
andirons, ready to light in the morning.

""O, Wal, just you see; here's a crane, pots, and kettles. I've found
the well, and a tin pail to draw water in, but some bruised; a pitcher,
with the nose broken off; six plates, three of 'em whole; four cups;
only one of them is broken, and a little piece is broken out of the
side of another; a couple of linen towels, but one of them is scorched
a little. I can't find any soap; but I've washed them out in lye. I've
found lots of knives, forks, and spoons; only they are black and rusty,
and the handles burnt off. Ain't it great, Wal?""

""Yes, we are all provided for. Ain't you glad we didn't stop with
Gabriel?""

""I guess I am.""

""Let us get everything ready to-night, because in the morning we shall
want to start early, and it will take some time to get breakfast, we're
going to have such a famous one.""

After helping Ned scour the kettles, Walter went to the castle, and
soon returned with some cord, which he wound around the knives,
affording a very good substitute for handles. He then ran them into the
ground, and rubbed them with brick and ashes, till he made them clean
and somewhat bright.

""Let's have a table, Wal. That will put the touch on.""

""Agreed.""

Ned drove four stakes into the ground with the crowbar, and Walter
brought a large panel from the hall, which he placed on them.

""I'll put the finishing stroke to it,"" said Ned; and, running back, he
came with a piece of splendid tapestry, which he flung over it; and now
they set the table.

""There,"" said Ned, ""who can beat that--a carved table, tapestry
table-cloth, and Sevres china dishes? Now for getting into the
blankets. Walter,"" said Ned, after they lay down, ""what were you
hunting so long in the woods after?""

""I was trying to find a tree that had an elbow at the root.""

""What do you want of that?""

""I'll tell you. In Godsoe's bark-mill the stone had a round hole in it,
and turned around the shaft; and it wabbled, though that didn't make
much difference in grinding bark, which was dry, and worth but little;
so that waste was of no consequence. In this stone the hole is square.
The shaft must turn with the stone on a pintle going into the upright
shaft; and if I don't have something to make it pull inwards and run
true, it will be all the time grinding against the curb I have made to
keep the pulp in, and slatting off and on.""

""How can you help it?""

""I've found a tree with an elbow at the root; and I'm going to dig it
up, frame one end into the upright shaft, bring the elbow down over
the stone wheel, put a pintle in the end of the shaft, bore a hole
through the elbow, and have it turn in that, letting the elbow run down
far enough for the beast to pull level; and then the stone _must run
true_.""

Next morning, after a glorious breakfast, the boys repaired to the
village. With the aid of a strong force, the tree was cut out by the
roots, the stick hewed on the spot, and transported on their shoulders
to the mill. By means of the vessel's purchase, planks laid, and plenty
of help, the great stone was parbuckled on to the platform, and put in
place.

""Now, fellow-citizens,"" said Ned, flinging up his hat, ""hurrah for a
Yankee bark-mill! Bring on your mules and olives.""

A mule was attached to the sweep, amid the cheers of the whole village.
The mill was found to work excellently well, and ground the olives so
fast that it required the efforts of all who had been employed bruising
them in mortars to carry the pulp to the chamber and press it.

""Now,"" said Walter, ""for the press. How did you use to press them,
Gabriel?""

""There were presses belonging to the grand seignior, with wooden
screws; but they were burnt.""

""I don't know but I could cut the thread of a wooden screw, if I had
time enough. However, that is not here nor there. I know what I _can_
do: I can make a press with a lever, that will give you as much again
oil as you can get by piling on stones, and make it right beside this
mill, where you can shovel the pulp on to it, and save all portage and
waste.""

The next day, Walter, Ned, and their fellow-workmen--who had become
quite expert in the use of tools--laid another platform within two feet
of the mill, and on a level with it, in order that the pulp could be
easily transferred from one to the other, and the oil from each run
into different ends of the same trough, and be dipped out between them.
He then cut a deep channel around the edge of the platform, leading to
the trough, to conduct the oil. After this he built up, with the aid of
the peasants, two abutments of stone, several feet above the platform,
leaving in the middle, near the top, an opening eighteen inches square.

""Are you a stone-mason?"" asked Gabriel, in surprise.

""No: but I've been used to building stone wall. I've worked on rocks
till my fingers were worn so thin I couldn't take up a cup of hot
coffee.""

Now with the cattle they hauled three halves of the mill-stones that
had been split to the spot, and, with skids and the tackle, placed them
on the abutments, one upon the other, composing an enormous aggregate
of weight.

""I calculate it will take some strength to lift those,"" said Walter,
viewing his work with great complacency. ""Now, Gabriel, for the biggest
beam in the old castle! If I was at home, I could get one big enough.""

""There is plenty of timber and large forests in France, my brother,
although, since the revolution, it has been cut away in this part.
Before that, the forests were very strictly guarded; but the National
Assembly have sold a great deal. There are great beams in the castle
that grew in the olden time.""

After much labor, they obtained from beneath one of the floors an oak
beam fifty feet in length and a foot square. One end of this was placed
in the opening left in the stone-work; at the other Walter built what
he called a ""gin,"" which was a tripod of timber, fourteen feet in
height, with a bolt at the top to fasten the tackle, and a windlass
between two of the legs, by which the timber could be raised or
lowered. When all was prepared, Gabriel and his friends put the sacks
filled with pulp on the press, piling them up four feet in height, then
poured on hot water, placed planks on the sacks, then blocks crosswise,
and one large one lengthwise. The mere weight of the planks and blocks
caused the oil to run merrily from the pulp, and pour into the trough.

The delighted peasants danced round the press, and Gabriel told the
boys it was better not to let the beam down, as the oil which ran from
the mill while the olives were grinding, and from the press, under that
light pressure, was of the best quality.

When it ceased to run, the oil in the trough was dipped out, and the
beam let down, when it began to run freely again. They stood upon the
beam, and put on rocks, till they pressed the cake dry.

""It will be difficult,"" said Gabriel, ""to get this beam up; and your
'gin' will be of no use without the tackle.""

""We have got another tackle. The captain will sell this, and take his
pay in oil, I know. Contribute among yourselves, and buy it.""

""That we will gladly do.""

""I've got some old wine,"" said Felix, ""that came out of the cellars of
the aristocrats; he can have that.""

It was about four o'clock of an afternoon when the boys arrived at this
successful termination of their philanthropic labors.

""This,"" said Gabriel, ""has been a great day, a good day, one long to be
remembered. Let us do no more to-day, but enjoy ourselves with these
good citizens; we can soon press the olives now.""

As they sat conversing, after supper, Walter said to the peasants,--

""People in our country--when a person has done a foolish thing; injured
himself in trying to hurt another--have a fashion of saying 'that he
has bitten off his nose to spite his face.' It seems to me that you did
a very silly thing when you broke the mill-stones and burnt up the oil
and wine presses of the aristocrats. The stone never harmed you. Didn't
you know that your crops were coming off, and that you would need all
these things yourselves? Why did you destroy those beautiful avenues
and groves? Now that the aristocrats are gone, you would be right glad
to have those noble trees yourselves.""

In the course of their talk, Walter related to Gabriel some of the
conversations he had held with the refugees at Salem, and observed that
a great proportion of the American people, though ready to sympathize
with any nation desirous of self-government, were struck with horror
at the cruelties of which they had heard, and the wholesale massacres
perpetrated, especially by the execution of the king and queen.

The peasant leaped to his feet; his eyes shot fire, his lips were drawn
apart, and his face assumed an expression so demoniacal as to leave
upon the minds of the boys no doubt of the part he had taken in these
terrible scenes.

""_Execution of a king!_"" he hissed between his teeth: ""what better is
the blood of a king than that of any other creature God has made?""

Controlling himself, he said more calmly,--

""Young citizens, you have been deceived. You have heard but one
story--that of the aristocrats, of the oppressors. Listen now to that
of the oppressed--to me, Gabriel Quesnard, a peasant born and bred on
the soil of France, as were all my ancestors. I am not about to relate
to you the cruelties practised in the days of my forefathers, when a
noble has been known to kill a peasant, that he might warm his feet by
thrusting them into his body on a cold day.""

""Horrible!"" exclaimed both the boys in a breath. ""Was that ever done?""

""Indeed, and it would be difficult to tell what cruelties were not
practised; neither shall I speak of such things as the peasants being
compelled to beat the water in the marshes with poles to keep the frogs
from croaking, when the wife of their lord was sick, lest they should
disturb her. But I shall tell you of those miseries, which are of
yesterday, which myself, my neighbors, and children of your ages, have
endured. Let me tell you of the '_lettres de cachet_,'--issued by the
king you pity so much,--by which a person was seized, perhaps in the
street, and, without any form of trial, hurried to the Bastile, while
his friends could only guess what had become of him. Any one who had
money enough could buy one.

""When we levelled that accursed dungeon, we found citizens who had
grown gray there, unconscious of crime and utterly ignorant of what
they were accused.

""In the spring the peasant is trying to get in his seed to raise bread
for his family. He, perhaps,--by some inadvertent word, wrung from him
by the bitterness of oppression,--has given offence to the _intendant_;
the _subdélégué_ comes along and says, 'Go do your _corvée_'
(compulsory labor) at such a place. The poor man must loose his cattle
from the plough, and work on the roads; or perhaps, in the midst of
harvest, must leave his grain to spoil, and go and carry convicts to
the galleys, haul ship-timber to the navy-yard, or supplies to some
garrison, while the soldiers prick his cattle with their swords, and
insult their driver. More than three hundred peasants, who owned their
land, were made beggars by the filling up of one valley in Lorraine.
Every peasant was compelled to buy, and pay a tax on, seven pounds of
salt a year, whether he used it or not.

""The _capitaineries_--""

""What were those?""

""The right to preserve the game, which meant that they might keep
whole herds of deer and boars, and flocks of partridges, to overrun
the peasant's land and eat up his crops. Did he presume to kill one,
to save the bread of his family, he was sent to the galleys; and this
right was not confined to their own lands, but extended to all the
lands of the district. Yes, and the peasant was forbidden to weed or
hoe his own grain, lest he should disturb the young partridges that
were devouring his substance. Neither was he allowed to cut or plough
under his own stubble, lest they should be deprived of shelter. This
was a right granted by the king to princes of the blood. All these
exactions came directly from the king, whom you pity so much. In
addition to this were countless seignioral rights. There were perpetual
dues. A seignior could sell his land, and still draw rent from the
very peasant who had bought it of him in the shape of seignioral dues.
They, too, had their '_corvées_,' and the peasant was forced to labor
for them a certain number of days in each year. On everything that he
owned must he pay dues to them. Yes, he must pay them for the right of
selling his own produce in the market. Though in my time this custom
of stilling the frogs was abolished, we were compelled to pay a fine
instead of it. When, amid all these impositions, the peasant has raised
his grain, he can't have a hand-mill to grind it in. He must grind in
the mill of the lord, bake his bread in the oven, and press his grapes
and olives in the press of his master, and pay for the privilege, and,
if unmarried, was subject to conscription; while from this and taxes
the nobles were exempt, and so were thousands of others--petty clerks,
government officers, and all worth over so much property. Thus all the
burden of taxation was thrown upon the peasant because he was poor,
and taken from the noble because he was not. To this it must be added
that the clergy, with their tithes, took what little was left. Now,
consider that I have omitted almost as much as I have mentioned, and
you will be able to see the poor man's condition under the tyranny we
have destroyed. That was the 'servitude of the soil.' Marvel not that
we were frantic, and only thought of destroying everything that was an
instrument of oppression while we had the power. Did you never see a
dog bite the stone that had been flung at him?""

""Yes,"" replied Ned.

""So it was with us. We hated those mills; those presses, where we had
been forced to work; those ovens, where we had been compelled to yield
up a portion of our scanty loaf; broad avenues of trees that we and our
folks had been forced to plant; those roads, adorned with trees so
beautiful to others, were watered with the tears of the oppressed, and
appeared frightful to us. In our delirium we thought only of destroying
all that could remind us of those detested tyrants and those bitter
days.""

""I have understood,"" said Walter, ""that, for these many years past,
the peasants had been less hardly dealt with; that, although the laws
remained unchanged upon the statute-books, they had not been rigidly
enforced.""

""That is true, citizens, and was the very reason of our rising.""

""That is strange, that people should rise just when their condition was
improving.""

""Had you fallen into a deep pit, from which you could see no possible
way of escape, you would resign yourself to your fate; but, did you
perceive some projection upon which you might clamber and escape, would
it not cause you to strain every nerve?""

""To be sure.""

""Thus it was with us. When we were less hardly dealt with, we knew it
was from lack of power; that it was not from charity, but fear. When we
felt that the clutch of the oppressor was loosening on the peasant's
throat, we were no longer resigned. Then came the news of what had been
done in your country. Our children who had fought in your armies had
returned. They brought with them these noble words, which were read
to us by the few who could read: 'that all men are created free, and
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' As we listened,
tears flowed from our eyes, our hearts grew hot, we trembled with a
feeling altogether new. We felt we also were men--struggled, broke our
letters, were _free_! Then we put to their lips the bitter cup of which
they had made us drink so long, avenged the wrongs of our ancestors,
and our own, and gave them blood for blood.""

As the boys listened, their sentiments underwent a change. They felt
that the greatest excesses of an ignorant people, in the paroxysm of
their fury, made frantic by oppression, were in a great measure to be
laid to the account of their oppressors.

""We,"" continued Gabriel, perceiving the impression he had made, ""are
called bloodthirsty, and viewed with horror, because we have shed much
blood in a short time; but they have been shedding it all the time.
Which, my brother, carries the most water to the sea, the river that
waters the valley, and whose stream is always full, or the mountain
torrent that floods the vale in the spring, and then leaves a dry
channel?""

""The river, to be sure,"" replied Walter.

""Such is the difference between them and us. For hundreds of years
there has not been a day when the peasant's blood has nor flowed at
the will of his master. We guillotine a noble, or a priest; the news
flies over all lands. Who knows, or cares to know, the misery he had
inflicted upon the poor, and by which he had deserved a thousand
deaths? Our banished aristocrats are scattered over Europe and America.
They are learned men, of noble blood; tell their story at every court,
among all peoples, and write it in books for all to read; while the
peasant has suffered in silence, perished in prisons by starvation,
and in the galleys, as unregarded as the dead leaves that strew yonder
vineyard.""

""I never thought of all these things before,"" said Walter, when
Gabriel concluded; ""this is indeed a story of fearful oppression.""

""It is a true story, citizen. For ages the blood of the oppressed has
been crying from the ground, and, at last, vengeance has come.""




CHAPTER VIII.

THE LAST DAY WITH THE PEASANTS.


That night, as the boys sat around their fire, Ned observed, ""Walter,
it appears to me that you have done the very thing you have been
talking about so long.""

""I don't understand you, Ned.""

""In making that mill and press for the peasants, you have certainly
done some good.""

""If so, I am surely glad of it; but I thought it was a shame for people
to work after such a fashion as they were doing, and, since I have
heard Gabriel, I wish I could do more.""

""Do you know what was running in my head all the time he was talking?""

""What?""

""That it was a blessed thing to live in a free country. If Captain
Rhines asks me if I've seen any better place than home, I think I shall
know what to say.""

""Ned, I'm glad,"" glancing at the new-made grave on which the moon was
shining, ""that we buried those people before we heard Gabriel talk; for
I am afraid we shouldn't have done it afterwards.""

""Perhaps not.""

""We ought to be thinking about going back.""

""The captain told us we might stay as long as we liked, except it
looked like a gale of wind.""

""We don't want to be like old sailors--stay till the last minute;
besides, our provision is almost gone.""

""Then we _must_ go; for I can't live as these people do.""

""Nor I, either. I was thinking how different they live from us--no tea
or coffee; a little thin wine, about as strong as cider: a few olives;
and soup made of bread, garlic, and potatoes; not a bit of meat; and
oil instead of butter.""

""Then their bread,"" said Ned, ""as black as your hat--what do you
suppose it is made of?""

""Rye and barley, I guess, or rye and buckwheat.""

""But they have some nice things--fruits and preserves.""

""I should think, now they've got clear of the seigniors, they might
have everything if they would only put in and work--might raise two
crops a year. Leroux said those potatoes he gave me were planted after
the wheat came off. Now, we don't have any niceties at our house. We
are plain, rough people; but, _heavens_! there's _enough_. I couldn't
help thinking of the difference between their dinner and ours. We have
a great pewter platter as big over as half a bushel on the table,
with great junks of pork and beef on it. Father will stick the great
knife up to the handle into five or six inches of clear pork or a junk
of beef all yellow with fat. For vegetables, we had about a peck of
potatoes, cabbages, onions, beets, and carrots; hot biscuit, tea and
coffee, a great loaf of rye and Indian bread--as much better than their
black stuff as white is better than Indian; and then mother will come
walking along just as careful with a brimming pan of milk, and say,
'Now, boys, help yourselves.'""

""And butter,"" said Ned, ""good, yellow butter, instead of oil.""

""And then, in the fall, when we kill an ox, such soups as are soups;
ain't made of bread, water, and garlics. Father'll take a great shin,
crack it up with the axe, and great junks of marrow will drop out of
it. That's the stuff in a cold day, I tell you. Give a boy plenty of
that, and it will make him stretch out and grow; give him strength to
put the axe in. We waste more in our family than they eat. I've looked
in all their houses; they don't have any swill-pail at the door; eat
the swill themselves.""

""I'll tell you what I'd like, Wal, and, if I ever get home, I mean to
have mother make it--a chicken pie, with real flaky crust, rings all
round it, and apple dumplings, with lots of sauce.""

""But about going back, Ned--shall we start in the morning?""

""We _can't_, Wal. We want to get the moss to fill our beds, and the
willow sets for Mr. Bell; then, you know, we want to go over to Felix
Bertault's, and see the silkworms.""

""Well, get ready to-morrow, and start bright and early in the morning.""

The next day they went over to the house of Felix. He told the boys he
could not show them the silkworms, as it was not the time of year at
which they were hatched. However, he showed them the eggs, which were
about as large as a mustard seed, and gray. He informed them that the
worm was like a common caterpillar, three or four inches long, lived
upon mulberry leaves, could not bear the cold, and, when spring came,
and it was most time for the mulberry to leaf, they put the eggs in a
warm room, in the kitchen, or wore them on their bodies, and the heat
hatched them. As soon as they were hatched, they put them on mulberry
leaves, which must be dry and tender. This made them grow so fast, that
in six days they were too large for their skin, when it cracked, and
they shed it, coming out with a new one; in six days more, shed that,
till they passed through five changes, and had four new skins.

""What do they do then?"" asked Ned.

""After shedding their last skin, they seem kind of miserable for a week
or more, and then they begin to eat very greedily, grow, and fill up
with the stuff they make the silk of.""

""What kind of stuff is it?"" asked Walter. ""I've torn open the bag, and
it looks like gum.""

""But they do something to it that makes it silk.""

""What next?""

""We know now that they want to spin; so we fasten upon the shelves
where we keep them little twigs, willow, bulrushes, and sprigs of
lavender, which they crawl upon, and begin to spin.""

""I should think they would crawl all over the room, and get trod on.""

""They won't go from the leaves.""

""How do they spin?"" asked Ned.

""They throw out little threads of silk, the same as a spider, from
two little holes in their noses, fasten them to the twigs, and make a
rough kind of covering to keep off the weather; then they spin a finer
thread, till they make a ball around themselves as large as a pigeon's
egg; gum the inside all but one end: then they have a real warm,
water-proof house, that will keep out the weather.""

""Is that the end of it?"" asked Walter.

""No. In this house the caterpillar turns into a moth.""

""_Into a moth!_""

""Yes, and eats its way out of the end that was not gummed, leaving
its old skin behind, just as a chicken does its shell. The female now
begins to lay eggs just such as I showed you.""

""What do they do then?""

""They die, the males in eight days, the females in four; and we have
the eggs to begin again. There is one of their nests,"" showing him a
cocoon.

""There's a hole in one end.""

""Yes; that is where the moth gnawed out.""

""What do you do with the eggs?""

""We wrap them in a cloth, and put them in a cool, dry place; but we
kill all the worms that we do not want to become moths, and lay eggs,
as soon as they are done spinning, by baking them in a hot oven.""

""What for?""

""If we didn't, they would become moths, eat out, cut the silk off, and
break the thread so that it could not be reeled.""

""What is done with this rough silk that is on the outside?""

""It is carded and spun like wool; so are those cocoons that the moths
hatch in.""

""I don't understand how the worm makes the silk all in one thread. Does
he roll over and over like a shaft, and wind it round him?""

""No; he puts it on, back and forth, moving his head from side to side
in crooked patches, but all one thread, because he keeps the end of it
in his mouth, and never breaks it.""

""But if they don't wind it round them, what keeps it in place?""

""The gum.""

""How do you get it off the cocoon?""

Felix called his wife, who took ten of the cocoons, and put them into
warm water to loosen the gum; then she stirred them with a little broom
of straw; the threads of the silk stuck to the broom so she was able
to take hold of them with her fingers; she then joined five of the
threads together, making two compound threads of the ten, and put those
two through holes in a thin piece of iron that lay across the kettle,
brought them together, wound them on a hand reel, and made a skein
of silk, which she divided, giving one half to Ned, and the other to
Walter.

Felix told the boys that they sold the cocoons at the mills where they
reeled it, as it required machinery to do it properly, and his wife had
only reeled that just to let them see how it could be done.

""Suppose the thread should break,"" said Ned.

""Then all you have to do is to lay the end on to the main thread, and
the gum will stick it.""

He said the reason his wife stood so far from the kettle was, that the
gum might cool and the threads not stick together. He then gave them
some eggs and cocoons to take home with them.

""Gabriel,"" said Walter, when they met again, ""I've changed my mind
since I came here. I thought at first it was the last place for a man
to live by farming; but if ever you get a good government, under which
a man can receive the fruits of his labor, and not be beggared by
imposition, I will engage to come here and get rich in ten years.""

""How could you do that, citizen?""

""In the first place I would make every day of the year tell. I'd raise
two crops in a year, where you raise one. I would build a mill to grind
and press these olives in a quarter of the time it takes you, and get
a third more oil than you can get from the press I made you. I would
build my house in the midst of my land, and not lose a great part of
my time walking back and forth, carting stuff, and wearing out both
cattle and carts. I would make a cart that would run so much easier
than yours, that one mule would haul as much as two do in yours. Then,
in the winter, when there was leisure, I would make a good road; that
would make half as much difference more. Then, instead of making
what you call a fallow (which is letting the ground, after a crop is
taken off, grow up to weeds, then ploughing them in, putting back no
more than you have taken out), I would keep cattle, raise corn, and
have manure. It takes, according to your statement, about thirty-five
days to raise a crop of silkworms; that pays first rate, and your
children could do nearly all that is to be done; it also comes at a
time when there's not much else to do. Now only see how much can be
raised. Here's a crop of wheat, potatoes, and buckwheat; after them (at
any rate every other year), vines and olives, that will grow on the
mountains where nothing else will, and come off late, after the other
crops are out of the way; then silk in the latter part of winter and
the early spring, before work is driving.""

Gabriel scratched his head, and replied, ""Citizen, so much work would
make a man a slave.""

""You are a slave now, and get nothing for it, either. I'd rather put
things through, and get something, then, when I'm old, lay back and
take the good of it, than to be forever a mulling, and eat up as fast
as I get. If you would only raise corn instead of this miserable rye,
you could have bread, pork, beef, fodder for your cattle, and dressing
for your land.""

The boys now began to prepare for departure, collecting moss, lavender,
and other herbs for their beds, getting willow sets from the island for
Mr. Bell, and some pieces of carved panel and broken china, on which
were beautiful designs, from the old castle.

When they returned, Gabriel said, ""Don't take these broken things
to America;"" and he gave them a bowl and goblet most elaborately
ornamented, while Raffard gave them a panel that had never been
injured, on which was the figure of a deer with an arrow in its flank.
Leroux gave Walter a pistol inlaid with silver, Tonnelot presented
Ned with a rapier richly ornamented; indeed, all were sorry to part
with them, and anxious to give them something as a token of affection
and remembrance. Julien, François, and Beaupré (sons of Bernard and
Bertault), brought from their houses pears preserved in honey, almonds,
figs, pickled olives, and preserved quinces.

Early the next morning they took leave of the peasants, and set out
with Gabriel for the vessel, having with them, in the cart, their
presents and the wine and oil contributed by the peasants for the
purchase of the tackle from the captain.

They arrived just before dinner, and the captain not only sold Gabriel
the tackle, but offered to buy all the oil he and his neighbors had
to dispose of at a much higher price than they could sell it for at
Marseilles, and also their honey.

After feeding his mules and eating a hearty dinner himself, Gabriel
went home in high spirits to carry the news to his neighbors.




CHAPTER IX.

THE MISTRAL.


As they were riding along on their way to the vessel, the boys amused
themselves by imagining the astonishment they would create at home
by telling all they had learned in regard to affairs in France,
and especially concerning silkworms, but were quite crestfallen
upon finding that the captain was as familiar with the subject as
themselves, who informed them that they had been, and were then, raised
at home.

""_At home!_"" cried both the boys, in surprise. ""Where?""

""They were raised in Virginia and Georgia when the country was first
settled. I have read about it in books in the Salem library. I read in
an old newspaper that President Stiles wore at Commencement, in 1788,
a gown of silk made and woven in Connecticut. Two years ago my mother
had a pair of silk stockings sent her from Northampton by a cousin of
ours, who raised the worms, reeled the silk, and made the stockings.""

""I never knew all that before,"" said Ned.

""Ah, my boy, you _might_ have known it,"" replied the captain; ""for you
had better privileges than Walter. There were books in the library that
told about it; but half the time, even in school, while your eyes were
on your book, you were dreaming of going to sea, and, the moment school
was out, were sailing boats, climbing on vessels' rigging, helping
bend sails; and you know you would work all Saturday afternoons for
Frank Hall, the rigger, hold a turn at the windlass, run of errands
to the blacksmith shop, in short, do anything if he would only let
you furl a royal when it came night, send up a royal yard, or reeve
running-rigging. Didn't Deacon Chase tell your mother that you would
certainly break your neck: for he saw you, only the day before, astride
the end of a royal-yard? You never found time to read about silkworms
or anything else.""

""That is true, sir. However, what I learned of the riggers all came
into play when I got on shipboard.""

After sleeping by a camp fire in the fresh air, the boys felt so
reluctant to get into their berths in the vessel, even for a night,
that they lost no time in filling their beds, and placing them in the
tree, where they enjoyed a most delightful night's repose.

""I declare, Ned,"" said Walter, as he woke in the morning, ""if we were
on wages, instead of shares, and were not eating our own grub, I
shouldn't care much though we had a few more lazy days.""

During the forenoon they were occupied in making rough coops for some
hens the captain had engaged of Gabriel; but, being at leisure after
dinner, they hastened to the platform to talk over the past, lay plans,
and cherish expectations for the future.

About three o'clock in the afternoon,--which was beautiful, with a
very light breeze that barely stirred the leaves on the evergreen
oak,--Walter said, ""How clear the sky looks! and the water in the
cove--I can see the bottom from here. I can see those sea-fowl that are
diving when they are on the bottom.""

""Only hear the crows,"" said Ned; ""what a yelling! Look in these pines;
they are black with them. They are having a meeting just as they do at
home.""

""Then I guess the sheep are having a meeting, too. Look under the side
of that ledge of rocks. What a lot of 'em! and their heads all one way!
There's one cloud, a real mare's tail"" (cirrus), ""creeping up in the
north.""

""Here comes Jacques, running as hard as he can. Look at him. He's
hallooing, and making signals. I can't hear a word he says; but it must
be something about the fleet.""

The boys, occupied with the singular conduct of Jacques, had ceased
to take note of the sky, or they would have perceived that the cirrus
cloud had spread out, covering a great extent of sky, while below it
was another, of darker hue, and, while striving to catch Jacques'
words, attributed his signals to something connected with the fleet;
and so did the captain, who, having observed his motions, was hastening
to the tree in order to see if there was any man-o'-war in sight.

But Jacques was shouting, ""Mistral, mistral!"" with all his might. There
was a sharp flash, followed by a terrific peal of thunder, a roar among
the tree-tops, and instantly the air was filled with broken limbs,
leaves, both green and dry, torn from the trees, and raised from the
ground, mixed with clouds of gravel. A large pine near by was torn up;
the platform, with everything on it, sent whirling in the air, the oak
bent, groaned, and seemed ready to follow the pine. Walter caught hold
of a limb forming one side of a crotch; the branch split down four or
five feet, when the limb to which he clung came in contact with another
cross limb; the tough fibres of the oak, aided by the spring of the
cross limb, held on, and there he hung, blown out like a streamer. Ned
caught by a larger branch, clasping it with his legs. The captain's
spy-glass, falling into the cleft of the fork, stuck there; three of
the chairs went over the land to sea; another lodged in the thick top
of a pine; the rest went across the cove, and were blown up against
the bank. Ned's blanket was twisted round the main-topmast rigging;
Walter's sailed for parts unknown. Ned's bed, lavender and all, went
to sea; Walter's was jammed between two rocks, on the end of the high
bluff.

Hail, mixed with snow, began to fall, and everything wore the garb of
winter. When the squall struck, the captain was half way up the tree;
the rope-ladder being on the weather-side, the lashings that held the
bull's eyes to the ground were parted, and the shrouds, with the
captain clinging to them, blew out at an acute angle with the tree.

""Ned!"" shouted Walter.

""All right, Wal, I am now,"" was the reply, as he succeeded in getting
hold of the limb over which that to which he clung was chafing.

""This beautiful climate of Provence,"" said Ned--""see the snow!""

""This wind is right from the Alps,"" said Walter. ""Cuts like a knife.""

It was indeed the terrible mistral, the scourge of Provence.

Sliding down the trunk of the tree, they found one of the lashings
dangling. Catching hold of it, aided by Jacques, who had now arrived,
they pulled down the shrouds, and relieved the captain.

There was not a hat on the head of any one save the pilot, and their
hair was plastered with snow, and faces cut by the hail.

""Where were the blockaders when you left, Jacques?"" asked the captain
the moment he could get breath.

""Some of them were cruising, some at anchor.""

""Two frigates went by here with a cutter yesterday. Where was Nelson?""

""Yesterday he chased a French ship, cut her off from Marseilles, and
she ran under the guns of a very heavy battery, an earth-work, half way
between here and Marseilles; and he is watching her.""

""Can they hold on?""

""No, except the Agamemnon. She is more under the lee. Nothing can
hold against this except they are under a lee, and strongly-moored
with anchors well bedded. They generally lie at a single anchor, and
the topsail yards swayed up, so as to be ready to get under way in a
moment.""

""We will hold on a while, to let the 'fiery edge' get off the wind, and
give them a chance to get out of the way.""

In the mean time the mainsail was balance-reefed, the scope hove in,
the fore topmast and main staysails loosed, ready to set, which was all
the sail the brigantine would bear, so great was the violence of the
wind.

Jacques now said to the boys, ""Why didn't you come down when I was
making signs to you, hallooing 'mistral' enough to split my throat?""

""We couldn't hear you.""

""Couldn't you hear the crows, and see the sheep all huddled together?""

""We didn't know what it meant.""

""I rather think you know now.""

They lay thus for an hour, when an order was given to man the
windlass. The crew, all young, athletic men, having enjoyed a long
repose,--stimulated by the strongest motives, self-interest, pride of
seamanship, and manly emulation,--sprang like tigers to their work, and
""catted"" the anchor by hand.

""There's your bed, Mr. Griffin,"" said Ned, as they shot by the high
bluff.

""Never mind; I've had one good night's sleep in it.""

""There's Nelson,"" said Jacques, as they rounded the first prominent
headland; ""he means to hold on. I had a good look at him yesterday with
a glass. He has sent his top hamper down; his yards are pointed to the
wind, and, I've no doubt, two anchors ahead.""

""Nelson hates the Yankees,"" said the captain. ""How he would grit his
teeth if he knew who we are!""

Nelson's dislike for the Yankees was based upon very solid grounds.

After the war of independence, the United States were prohibited by
Great Britain from all trade with her West India colonies. Before the
war that trade had been exceedingly profitable, and the Americans were
loath to relinquish it. It had been no less so to the inhabitants of
the islands, custom-house officers, and all holding office under the
crown, since that shrewd and persistent people, fully appreciating the
importance of the principle illustrated by the old saw of ""throwing a
sprat to catch a herring,"" had never shown themselves ungrateful. With
a shrewd suspicion of this, the home government sent out a fleet to
look after matters in general, and enforce prohibition.

But the naval officers, from the admiral to his midshipmen,
dearly loved dinner-parties given by the civil magistrates and
wealthy merchants, and were much influenced by them. The officers
of his majesty's customs--governor, generals, and presidents of
council--missed many a box of spermaceti candles, and were often
feelingly reminded of their old friends by their empty pockets. When,
therefore, a down-east brig, displaying the stars and stripes, and
laden scuppers to with lumber, spermaceti candles, codfish, butter,
hoops, apples, and live stock, entered the harbor of a British island,
and the boarding officer saw the sharp face of some Yankee friend
peering over the rail, with an expression, ""It's _me_, and no mistake,""
it was certainly natural that he should greet him cordially; and when
the captain presented a protest, setting forth that he had sprung his
mast, or sprung a leak, was in distress, and wished to discharge enough
of his cargo to enable him to get at the leak, and sell enough to pay
his repairs, the official could not refuse so reasonable a request.
Thus it happened that a great many American vessels sprung a leak; and
whatever number of vessels went in loaded, they always came out light,
and the Yankee master, with his pocket full of British gold, then
sailed for Martinico to buy molasses.

There were vessels in the States, built before the war, having British
registers. These were run out there, under their old registers, and no
questions asked.

A still more audacious evasion was practised. Captains took the oath of
allegiance, hoisted British colors, and the custom-house officials gave
them British registers, although American built, owned by Americans,
and with American captains and crews.

But in 1784, when Nelson--who cared nought for dinner-parties, and
whose ruling nature was love of glory and duty--was sent out to the
West Indies, under Admiral Hughes, and found the British ports full of
these illicit traders, he pounced upon them like a falcon upon a flock
of herons. Adhering to the words of the statute, that all trade to and
from the British West Indies and America must be in British bottoms,
navigated by British captains, three fourths of the crew British
seamen, and owned by Englishmen, inhabitants of Great Britain or her
colonies, he seized at once four American vessels under English colors,
with English registers, but with American captains and crews, owned and
built in America. But the American captains, so far from submitting,
prosecuted him in the civil court for assault and imprisonment, laying
their damages at the enormous sum of four thousand pounds sterling,
while Nelson, knowing he could not obtain a fair trial in the islands,
dared not leave his ship for eight weeks, for fear of being arrested
on a civil suit; and, as he continued to seize vessels, the captains,
after his return to England to avoid prosecution, served a writ on his
wife, laying the damages at twenty thousand pounds sterling.

The admiral was disposed to wink at these proceedings, and, in reply to
a representation from Nelson, said it was an affair of the custom-house
officers, and ordered him not to interfere with their decisions.

In this dilemma he petitioned to the king, who came to the rescue, and
ordered him to be defended by _his_ lawyers. The Yankees, however, were
an overmatch for him, aided as they were by unprincipled officials.

American captains would clear for some of the Dutch or French islands,
then go to Trinidad, put the vessel under Spanish colors, ship a few
creoles, to put a better face on the matter, take some live stock on
deck, and go to the British islands.

The custom-house officers, despite the efforts of Nelson, would admit
them, under an old order from the Board of Treasury, 1763, declaring
British ports open to Spanish vessels bringing bullion and live stock,
although all the bullion they brought was a hold full of Yankee lumber.

Our young readers will now perceive why Nelson disliked the Yankees,
and how much good it would have done him to have closed his jaws upon
the ""Arthur Brown.""

""Suppose we should run up the colors, captain,"" said Walter, ""and stir
them up a little.""

""We are dead to leeward. If too much provoked, he might slip his cables
and come down on us.""

""No provocation,"" said Jacques, ""could make him leave the vessel he is
watching; for he knows as soon as he makes sail she is away.""

It was evident the brigantine had already been the subject of close
scrutiny; for, while Ned was bending the flag to the halyards, a flash
was seen from the stern of the ship, followed by the report, and a ball
sank harmless into the water, a long distance to windward; for the guns
of that day were of short range, compared with those of the present
time.

As the flag streamed out on the wind, shot followed shot in quick
succession, attesting the galling nature of this taunt.

""Let her luff, Lancaster,"" said the captain to the seaman at the helm.

""Luff, sir.""

""That will do; steady.""

""Steady, sir.""

""He likes the looks of us so well, Mr. Griffin, we'll give him a chance
to see more of us.""

The firing now suddenly ceased.

""He knows by our springing our luff,"" said Jacques, ""that he's throwing
away his powder and shot.""

""I see a boat,"" said the second mate; ""he's going to board us.""

The captain, getting into the companion-way, where he could brace
himself, as it was impossible to stand without holding on to something,
put the glass to his eye.

""There's a man overboard,"" he cried.

""God help him,"" said Walter; ""he can't live long in this sea.""

""He's got hold of something that has been flung over,--a spar or
plank,--and they are after him.""

In a few moments he could be seen with the naked eye whenever he
rose on the crest of a wave. They continued silently to watch him,
approaching fast before the wind and sea.

""They don't see the man,"" shouted the captain; ""the boat's crew don't
see him, the vapor is so thick, and he so low in the water; they are
lying on their oars, and the cockswain is standing up, looking round.
We must save him, or he's a dead man. Hard down the helm.""

Instantly Walter, followed by Ned and two more of the crew, one of whom
was Henry Merrithew (the strongest man in the ship's company), sprang
to cut the lashings of the boat. It was no child's play to launch a
boat, get clear of the vessel, and pull to windward against that wind
and sea; but with the exception of Ned, who made up in resolution and
quickness of apprehension for lack of strength and practice, these men
had from childhood been brought up in boats, accustomed to fishing
among shoals in the edge of the surf, and pursuing sea-fowls among
breaking rocks. Enveloped in spray, they forced the boat to windward
with long, steady strokes, while the captain, with his eye on the man,
pointed out the direction in which they were to pull, which, as they
were back to, was a most effectual aid.

""Keep cool, Merrithew,"" said Walter, who pulled the after oar, as he
heard the crack of a thole-pin behind him; ""keep cool; if you break
that oar or thole-pin, we are dished.""

""Here he is, close aboard,"" said Ned, looking over his shoulder.

Walter, flinging his oar out of the row-lock into the scull-hole,
steered the boat directly for the man, who was clinging by the
jack-stay to a royal yard.

""Ship your oar, Ned, and stand by.""

Ned caught the end of the spar as it came broadside on, when it
drifted alongside of the boat, bringing the man abreast of Merrithew,
who caught him by the hair and collar of his coat. Notwithstanding
the great strength of the seaman, he could not break the death-grip
of the drowning man. In a moment Blaisdell drew his knife across the
jack-stay, and he was taken on board.

""A midshipman, by his dress, and dead--dead enough, too, poor boy,""
said Merrithew, as he laid him in the stern-sheets.

""There's life in him yet,"" said Walter. ""I saw him treading water with
his feet to keep the spar from rolling over, while you were pulling up.""

""His mouth is shut,"" said Blaisdell, ""which shows he knew how to take
care of himself in the water. If he was dead, his mouth would be partly
open, and his tongue between his teeth.""

""There's a big sea coming; round with her before it gets along; pull,
boys, pull, and don't let him die in the boat. The air is colder than
the water, and taking him out of the water has chilled him.""

When the boat came alongside, and the apparently lifeless body was
conveyed to the cabin of the brigantine, every heart was touched.

""Dear little fellow! He can't be more than eighteen; and what a
noble face!"" said the captain, while they were stripping off his wet
clothing, rubbing the body, and wrapping him in blankets. ""There's
life,"" said he after he was placed in the captain's own berth. ""I can
just see that he breathes, and there's a faint fluttering of the heart.""

As the readiest and most efficacious means in their power, they put
bags filled with hot salt to his feet and other parts of his body. His
cheeks were pale, flesh cold, muscles relaxed, and eyes half closed.
The crew of the man-o'-war's boat, after witnessing the rescue,
endeavored to return; but they could no longer perceive the ship, and,
as the only course left them by which to save their own lives, pulled
for the brigantine.

A rope was thrown to them as they came under her stern, the ""gig""
hoisted on board, and the brigantine kept on her course.

""Make yourselves at home, boys,"" said the captain, ""here's plenty to
eat, and not much to do.""

""You picked up the young gentleman, sir,"" said the cockswain of the
gig, addressing the captain.

""Yes; he's in my berth below.""

""Will he win through it, sir?""

""I think so; but there's just the breath of life in him.""

""God be thanked! he's a fine young gentleman, and much thought of by
all the ship's company; there's not a man but would risk his life to
save him. He was very poorly when we were in Leghorn, but has been
getting quite stout latterly.""

""How did he get overboard?""

""I don't know; the boat was hanging at the cranes, and we were sitting
in her, when there was a shout, 'Man overboard!' While they were
lowering us away, the boatswain sung out that it was Mr. Reed. I
suppose he slipped. The ship was rolling very heavy, and everything
covered with sleet. We never got sight of him at all, but pulled the
way we thought he must drift.""

The young man lay for three hours in the condition we have described,
breathing regularly, but faintly, and manifesting no other signs of
returning consciousness than a convulsive twitching of the eyelids. The
captain hung over him with the greatest anxiety, making such outward
application as he thought of use.

In three hours more, to his great delight, his patient was able to
swallow; but it was not till nine o'clock the next morning, twelve
hours after he was taken from the water, that he could speak, or reply
to questions. Ascertaining where he was, and by whom rescued, he seemed
greatly moved, and expressed the wish that he had perished rather than
be carried to Marseilles, and become a French prisoner of war.

""Make yourself easy, sir,"" replied the captain. ""I will cut my right
hand off before I will deliver those who have come on board my vessel
in distress into the hands of their enemies. I'll put you and your men
into an English man-o'-war.""

This frank declaration proved more efficacious than all the other
remedies that had been administered. His pale cheeks flushed in a
moment, the light of youth and vigor returned to his eyes, and, after
eating, he got up, and put on his uniform, which the seamen had dried
for him, and scoured the buttons. He then went on deck, and met the
boat's crew, who manifested great pleasure at seeing him. He shook
hands with them all, calling each man by name.

The weather now began to moderate fast. The reefs were shaken out,
yards sent up, and all sail made upon the vessel. When, at length, the
high lands of Marseilles, and Planier Island, ten miles from the city,
came into view, and it was evident the coast was clear of blockaders,
the brigantine was hove to. A very strict watch was kept during the
night; and, just as the sun rose, the lookout at the mast-head sung
out, ""A sail to leeward!"" The mate went aloft with the glass, and
reported that it was an English man-o'-war.

""She is beating back to her station,"" said the captain. ""We'll get our
breakfast while she is working up.""

The midshipman, somewhat surprised at the coolness of the captain,
said, ""You have great confidence in the sailing qualities of your
vessel, captain.""

""I have reason for it, Mr. Reed,"" was the reply. ""Indeed, if assured
this wind would hold, I should not fear to lie here till she came
nearly within gunshot.""

After the meal was concluded, which was not at all hurried, the
man-o'-war was near enough to be distinguished with the naked eye.

""Do you recognize that frigate, Mr. Reed?""

""Yes, sir. It is the Leda, Captain Campbell.""

""One of your blockading fleet?""

""Yes, sir.""

The frigate, with every sail set, now came up fast.

""I am about as near to her as is prudent,"" said the captain, and gave
orders to launch the gig.

He then said, ""Now, Mr. Reed, there is one of your own fleet. You are
at liberty to depart with a fair wind and a fresh crew. Your captain,
I believe, don't like us Yankees; but give my respects to him, and add
whatever you think proper.""

All sail was made on the brigantine, and, by the time the boat reached
the frigate, she was nearing the harbor of Marseilles.

Notwithstanding Nelson's prejudices (certainly not groundless), the
Arthur Brown had not been a week in Marseilles when a flag of truce
came in, and by it came a letter to the captain from the midshipman,
enclosing a note from Nelson, thanking him for the rescue of his
officer, and the kindness manifested to both him and his crew.




CHAPTER X.

THE INFERNAL.


The midshipman, at the close of his letter, written in the most
affectionate spirit, particular reference being made to his rescuers,
Walter, Ned, and their companions in the boat, on that occasion, said,--

""You will recollect, my dear sir, that when you first hove in sight,
on the day of the gale, it was not so thick as afterwards, and then
a person in either vessel could, with a glass, easily make out the
other; but, shortly after I fell overboard, it shut down thick of snow.
During that time, our captain and first luff (lieutenant) recognized
the Arthur Brown, knew her to be the same vessel that was almost under
the guns of the Lowestaff in a fog, some months ago, and that she
gave chase to. The officers and crews of all the other vessels had a
good chance to look at her, when you lay so long under the guns of
the castle, after running the fire of the flag-ship. Her masts rake
so much, she carries such a cloud of canvas and is such a beautiful
model, that there is no mistaking her, although you have altered her
paint since the last trip. The fleet has taken scarcely any prizes, so
that all are hungry for prize-money. Every one of us from the admiral
to the powder-monkeys, feel chagrined at being thus bearded; that our
reputation as seamen will suffer if you should again escape us. There's
another motive. We all know if we could take the Arthur Brown, and
put a few light guns on board of her, she would catch everything on
the coast, and fill our pockets with prize-money. Add to this, your
slapping our captain in the face with your flag, the other day, and
you will perceive how matters stand between us. In short, while your
noble treatment of myself and shipmates has gained you the respect and
good will of every one,--and you would experience the utmost kindness,
should you fall into our hands,--believe me, you have a difficult task,
and one which will tax your resources to the utmost, for the fleet are
determined to have the brigantine, or sink her. I could not do less
than put those, to whom I owe my life, on their guard. But, from what
I have seen of yourself, the character of your crew, and the capacity
of the brigantine, I should not be so much surprised as my shipmates,
should you, by some of those chances which always seem to turn up in
favor of your people, escape us, though it by no means becomes me, as a
British officer, to express any such desire.""

The ship's company of the brigantine being, with the exception of
Jacques, all Americans, most of them having grown up together from
childhood, and a good part of them shipmates on the last voyage, the
relation between officers and crew was very different from that usually
existing on shipboard.

The communion was also more intimate from the fact that no one was
hired, each having a share in the risk and profits of the voyage, and
that they were bound together by a sense of common danger, cherished
a personal attachment to each other, and reposed perfect confidence
in the ability of the captain, insomuch that Quesnard, who marked
with curious interest the manner in which things went on board the
brigantine, said that he ""would vote for a king in France if they could
have a government like the government of that vessel.""

Upon receiving the letter, Captain Brown, calling his officers and crew
together, read it to them, remarking, ""You see, boys, what they are
preparing for us.""

They received the communication without much emotion of any kind. Henry
Merrithew observed, in his drawling way,--

""Yes, cap'n, I see what they calc'late; but they say 'a bird in the
hand is worth two in the bush.' Me and George here, and Elwell, was
figerin' up on our chists, with chalk, what each man's share of this
cargo of silks and other truck that we are taking in will come to. If
it comes to as much as the one we've just discharged,--and Elwell,
who's been in the trade afore, judges it will come pretty well up,
cause sich stuff is high now on account of the blockade,--why, I, for
one, think the game's worth the candle.""

""It's my opinion, captain,"" said Sewall Lancaster, squirting the
tobacco-juice through his teeth over the rail, ""that it's a good thing
for us these English are making the blockade so close, as long as we
kin run it; and I reckon we kin, because, as Henry says, it makes both
the cargo we fetch and the one we take away worth double; and I guess,
as that youngster says,--not wishing any harm to him howsomever,--that
something'll turn up on our side.""

This cool preference of greater risk, with the prospect of greater
profit, was received with a universal murmur of assent.

""Well, boys,"" said the captain, folding up the letter, ""I wanted to
know your minds, because we can't wait here a great while for a gale
of wind to drive the fleet from their anchors. We have sold our cargo,
and shall soon be short of provisions, and there are none to be had
here. We must take our chance, the first suitable night, to run their
battery, unless I can contrive some other way.""

While the vessel was completing her lading, the captain seemed quite
thoughtful, and spent the greater portion of his time alone on a high
hill, called Viste, over which led the road to Paris, and commanding a
good view of the fleet.

The port of Marseilles is completely land-locked, being a salt water
lake, of the shape of an egg, half a mile in length, and a quarter of a
mile in breadth. The entrance into it is not more than a hundred yards
in width, and defended by strong fortifications.

From his situation on the hill, the captain soon had ocular evidence of
the accuracy of the statements contained in the letter he had received.
He saw that not only had the number of vessels cruising outside been
reduced to two, but they had formed a complete cordon across the
road, effectually stopping all egress, except by encountering their
broadsides at short range. The increased number of vessels also made it
evident to him that the night patrols would be doubled.

As the young captain--after a careful scrutiny of the disposition
of the vessels--sat with the glass lying across his knees, an idea
presented itself, which, on his way to dinner, he more fully matured.

""Jacques,"" said he, while eating, ""what was it you were saying the
other day to a countryman of yours about a fire-ship? I can only catch
a word or two, here and there, of your dialect.""

""I was telling him, captain, that there were two condemned vessels
lying here, one a privateer, and the other a Guineaman (slaver), and
the government was going to make fire-ships of them both, and send them
down among the blockading fleet, now that they are moored in such close
order.""

""Indeed,"" replied the captain; but, making no further allusion to the
topic, he asked, ""How is the water along the shore, from the outlet of
the port, as you go to the westward?""

""The shore is quite bold, captain, with a few shoal spots, for some
miles.""

""Could you carry this vessel along shore, in the night, for two miles
without getting aground?""

""Yes, captain. I can feel my way with the lead, or I can carry you
through narrow passages, between islands and the main shore, where no
man-o'-war can follow.""

The captain said no more, but, rising from the table, sought his
merchants, who went with him to wait upon the authorities. From them he
learned that the privateer only was to be fitted for a fire-ship; that
the magazine was already made, and the powder would be put on board
directly.

Captain Brown bought the slaver for a trifle, as she was fit only to
break up for her iron. He also bought some old sails, and then hauled
her alongside his own vessel. She was not far from the tonnage of the
Arthur Brown; and there was so much resemblance between them, that, in
the night, one might easily be mistaken for the other. They were both
brigantines, but the difference was this: the main boom of the slaver
was shorter, she had no royal-mast, and was painted differently.

The young captain now communicated his plans to his crew, who set
to work with a will to execute them. The main-boom was lengthened,
a royal-mast, royal-yard, and flying-jib-boom added, and she was
painted precisely like the Arthur. The old sails were limed to make
them conspicuous in the night, as, in this case, no concealment was
intended; ballast was put in, to give her the appearance of being
loaded; in short, even a close observer would not have distinguished
one from the other in the night. The two were now hauled near to the
entrance of the harbor, awaiting the motions of the fire-ship.

The moment the captain told his plans to his officers and crew, Walter
and Ned volunteered to take charge of the slaver.

""I don't believe,"" said the captain, ""they will accomplish anything
with their fire-ship, except a scare.""

""Why so?"" asked the second mate.

""Because they must have a northerly wind to get down to the fleet, and,
with the wind that way, will not be likely to have a very dark night.
The guard-boats will probably see them before they get very near, and
give warning. It cannot be very hard work to get out of the way of a
vessel steering herself.""

""I should like very well,"" said Walter, ""to have the fleet scattered,
but have no desire that the young midshipman, whose life we labored so
hard to save, should be blown to pieces.""

""He won't be,"" said Jacques.

""Why not he as liable as another?""

""Because the Agamemnon, the vessel he belongs to, is the fastest vessel
they have, and is most always cruising.""

In the hold of the old privateer, near the foot of the mainmast,
was constructed a square room for a magazine, in which were placed
eight hundred barrels of powder. From this to the stern a fire-proof
passage-way or trunk was made, in which the train was laid, that it
might not explode prematurely. The train was ignited by a port-fire,
arranged to burn long enough to give those firing the train time to
escape.

The deck was filled with barrels of tar, dry wood, shavings, live
shells, pieces of pot-metal, spikes, broken glass, and links of
chains, to act as missiles when the explosion took place, and the guns
were loaded with grape shot.

[Illustration: THE EXPLOSION.]

Men who had volunteered for the duty were to fire the mass of
combustibles on deck in three places, and the train leading to the
magazine, all at the same moment, whenever the approach of the
fire-ship was discovered by the enemy. Then, the fire being applied,
and the helm lashed, she was to be left to make her own way.

The night, so anxiously expected, came at last, hazy, with here and
there a star just visible; the wind moderate, but fair, and enough of
it to give the vessels good headway. It was half an hour past midnight
when this infernal contrivance glided silently from the harbor and
passed the forts,--having the appearance of a blockade runner,--and
steered for the centre of the English fleet, followed by the slaver
with all her sails set. She, however, hove to, when a short distance
from the port, leaving the infernal to proceed alone.

Moments seemed lengthened to hours, as the boys, hanging over the rail,
gazed upon the dim outlines of the receding vessel, around which dark
shadows were closing fast. Although the distance was not great which
separated them from the fire-ship or the fleet, a thin haze, which
obscured the light of the stars, completely obstructed the view. With
bated breath they listened for some token from the bosom of that misty
shroud, which they strove in vain to penetrate.

No sound, save the occasional surge of the helm in the lee becket, or
the quiver of a sail, as the vessel came up to or fell off from the
wind, disturbed the repose of the night.

""Walter,"" whispered Ned, ""this silence is fearful; they must be almost
there.""

A pressure of his arm was the mute response. A few moments more of
suspense, when a stern hail broke the ominous silence so suddenly that,
with a convulsive start, the boys sprang to their feet. There was no
reply. Again the summons rose louder on the air, instantly followed by
a shot.

""They are discovered,"" said Ned. But even while the words were issuing
from his lips three spirals of bright flame, shooting up from the
fire-ship, revealed to the boys--who were looking from darkness towards
the light--a scene combining every element, both of the sublime and
terrible, and which thrilled them to the heart's core.

The period of French history, during which the events here narrated
occurred, abounded in the most startling contrasts. Acts of utter
selfishness and the most fiendish cruelty were relieved by others
manifesting the purest philanthropy and noble self-sacrifice. The crew
of the fire-ship, finding they were discovered, and foreseeing that if
they left the vessel to drift down by herself no damage would probably
be inflicted upon the enemy, after saying to each other, ""We will cover
ourselves with glory, lay her alongside an English ship, blow her to
atoms, and die for France,"" kindled the mass of inflammable material on
deck in three places, and by this light, which constantly increased in
intensity, the boys beheld the black hulls of the English ships, every
shroud and rat-line standing out in bold relief against the dark sky,
and the boats' crews, who, supposing the vessel a blockade-runner, were
pulling from different directions to ""board"" her; but, when the flames
revealed her true character, there was an instinctive pause; they lay
upon their oars.

""Give way, my hearts of oak,"" shouted the officer of the leading boat;
""we'll put out their fire and their slow-match.""

With an answering shout they dashed the oars into the water again;
but the flames burst from the port-holes and over the rail into their
very faces, rendering useless all attempts to board, the very purpose
for which this mass of material had been prepared and ignited. As,
expecting explosion, they pulled rapidly away, a volley from the
fire-ship killed the midshipman in charge and two men. The stern of
that vessel, where stood the four men, was as yet clear of flame, the
wind carrying the fire and smoke forward.

""Why, in the name of Heaven, don't they leave? There's a boat towing
astern,"" cried Ned; ""she must blow up soon.""

""Ned, those men don't mean to leave.""

""Don't mean to leave!""

""No; they know if that vessel is left to steer herself, ten to one if
she strikes an English ship. They're going to sacrifice themselves.""

Right ahead of the infernal, as near as they could swing at their
anchors, lay an eighty-gun ship and a sixty-four. It was evidently
the intention of these desperate men to lay her between them, apply
the match, and blow both themselves and their enemies into eternity
together. It seemed most probable that they would accomplish their
purpose; the breeze was light, and scarcely felt by the men-of-war,
whose crews had cut the cables and made sail, while the infernal, by
reason of momentum previously acquired, was coming down fast, bearing
destruction and death.

Now ensued an uproar impossible to describe. Blazing cinders and sparks
from the fire-ship blew on to the main-topsail of the eighty, which was
instantly in flames; but with that cool courage and perfect discipline
so characteristic of British seamen, the topmen cut the sail from the
yard, and passed water in buckets; the boats' crews were towing the
ship ahead, while at the same time a hot fire was kept up upon the
fire-ship from every gun that could be brought to bear; the other
ships, that were out of her path, also poured in whole broadsides, in
the hope of either blowing up or sinking her before she should get near
enough to do execution.

""That ship is gone for't,"" said Ned, as the helmsman of the infernal,
seeing the two ships were separating, and that he could hope to
destroy but one, altered his course, and steered direct for the
eighty. At this moment a well-directed broadside cut off the foremast
of the fire-ship, that, with all the head sails, went over the side.
This brought the vessel to the wind, and arrested her progress, the
man-o'-war improving the fortunate moment to escape.

The scene now grew appalling. The air was filled with the roar of
hundreds of cannon, while, as the now unmanageable vessel came head to
wind, the flames ran up the rigging of the mainmast and swept over the
place where those self-devoted men stood.

In the midst of this horrid din, a shell exploded on her deck, a flash
of blue flame illumined with its ghastly light the whole horizon,
followed by an explosion that made every vessel quiver as though racked
by the throes of an earthquake. The blazing mast shot up to the sky
like a rocket, followed by jets of water and torrents of flame, bearing
before them countless missiles, legs, arms, and other portions of
the dismembered bodies of that ill-fated crew, to which succeeded a
darkness made more intense by clouds of smoke, and a stillness as of
death.

As the smoke gradually lifted and drifted away to leeward before the
wind, the eyes of all in the fleet were naturally directed to the scene
of the explosion and the spot from which the infernal had disappeared,
when they beheld what they supposed to be the Arthur Brown coming
rapidly down before the wind, her snow-white canvas conspicuous against
the frowning sky. Instantly concluding that the shrewd Yankees had
improved this moment of confusion and alarm to escape, ""The brigantine!
The brigantine!"" rang out from many a boat's crew; and the water was
white with the foam of oars, as from all directions they dashed upon
their prey.

The boys, excited by the roar of artillery, the smell of gunpowder, and
the examples of daring they had witnessed, were now perfectly reckless.

""This is glorious, Wal,"" cried Ned. ""I'm going to stick her for sea,
and give them a pull for it.""

Notwithstanding a shot across their bows from the sixty-four, and a
volley of small arms from the boats, they refused to heave to; and it
was not till the man-o'-war's men were climbing over the side, that,
sliding down the painter, they cut the rope and pulled away with might
and main, the captors being too much occupied with their prize to
concern themselves about them.

Having put a good distance between themselves and the boats, they lay
upon their oars to breathe.

""Won't there be some swearing, Ned,"" said Walter, ""when they come to
look over their prize, and find her a condemned slaver, full of rocks?""

""Yes; but I guess there will be more when they find what I have written
on the companion-way.""

In the afternoon, while waiting for the fire-ship, Ned had written with
chalk on the slide of the companion-way the value of the Arthur Brown's
cargo, showing the man-o'-war's men what a rich prize they had lost,
closing with some reflections upon the disappointments to which mankind
are liable, and leaving the best respects of himself and Walter.

In the mean time the Arthur Brown, without a single sail set to attract
attention, propelled by muffled sweeps, and skilfully piloted by
Jacques, was creeping along under the shadow of the land in calm water,
till, entirely beyond the reach of observation, a kedge was silently
lowered to the bottom, and she waited for her boat. Upon the arrival
of the boys, with every inch of canvas spread, the swift vessel, now
swifter than ever (for she had been coppered in Marseilles--a recent
practice, and at that time scarcely known in the States), turned her
prow homeward.

Just as the sun rose above the horizon in the morning, the lookout at
the mast-head of the Agamemnon, sung out, ""Sail, O!""

""Where away?""

""Right ahead, sir.""

Mr. Reed beheld through the glass the well-known form of the Arthur
Brown, bathed in sunlight, studding sails, alow and aloft, with the
wind on her quarter making for the Straits of Gibraltar at a rate that
defied pursuit. A smile of satisfaction--which he walked forward to
conceal--passed over the fine features of the midshipman, as he took
the glass from his eye.

When, having composed his features, he reported to his superiors that
he knew the vessel, and that it was the brigantine, it was considered
useless to chase her; and long before eight bells struck, she had faded
from their view.




CHAPTER XI.

A STARTLING DISCLOSURE.


By reason of the tarry of the Arthur Brown in the oven, her voyage was
so lengthened, that much uneasiness was felt respecting her at Pleasant
Cove, and in Salem, by the parents of the captain and Ned.

A great many consultations were held between Lion Ben, Captain Rhines,
Fred Williams, John Rhines, and Charlie Bell, her owners.

""Father,"" said Ben, ""I'm afraid they have been taken by the English, or
foundered in a levanter. Only consider how much longer they have been
gone than they were on the other trip!""

""They say,"" replied Fred, ""that people there are killing each
other--half of them drunk, the rest crazy; perhaps they've been
murdered.""

Charlie Bell thought, that as affairs there were in a very unsettled
state, the people had but a scanty supply of food, and the vessel being
loaded with provision, the mob might have boarded her, and helped
themselves.

""I don't see any particular cause for so much concern, boys,"" said the
old captain. ""If it was peaceable times, and the Arthur Brown was a
regular trader, it would be another matter, and there might be some
reason for anxiety; but there are a thousand things that might delay
a blockade-runner. We have heard the blockade is very strict now that
Nelson is there, and we all know what he is. She may have had bad land
falls, been chased off the coast half a dozen times, had her sails
blown away, or lost some spars, and had to go to Leghorn to repair,
or have been crippled by a broadside, as she came near being before.
I've been there a good deal in past days, sometimes for a long time. In
December and January they have most delightful weather, and no storms
to scatter blockaders; and then, when it gets into February, they'll
come.""

""Well, father,"" said Ben, ""we are out of the world; can't hear
anything. I wish you would start off up to Boston and see Mr. Welch;
perhaps you may get some information there.""

This request being seconded by the others, the captain said, ""I don't
know but I will; I shall have to go up before long to see him on some
other business, and the coaster is going up the last of the week.""

He obtained no information in Boston or Salem, but determined to
remain there a while. On going through a portion of the town very much
occupied with sailor boarding-houses, he made a short cut through
""Black Dog Alley,"" when his progress was stopped by a crowd of sailors,
all more or less under the influence of liquor. One old tar had taken
it into his head to hire a truckman's horse for a ride up and down the
street. Drunk as he was, he sat the horse well; for, as he boasted,
he had been brought up among horses, and was half horse himself. He
would not have the harness taken off the horse, which was a leader, but
mounted, taking the trace-chains on his shoulder, with the rattling of
which he and all seemed to be delighted; and, as he was flush of money,
his vest pockets being crammed with bills, besides some silver in a
purse which he frequently shook in the truckman's face, exclaiming,
""Rich owners, my old boy!"" the latter seemed inclined to submit to
all his whims. He was surrounded by an admiring crowd of shipmates,
who, like himself, had just been paid off, all gloriously drunk, but
good-natured, and bent on having a merry time of it. In addition to
these was a crowd of loafers and loungers, such as are generally
abundant when sailors are paid off and liquor is plenty.

The dress of this horseman was comical enough. He had on a pair of
Turkish trousers, an India shawl round his waist for a sash, a shirt
made of fine grass-cloth also of East India manufacture, exceedingly
fine and beautiful; on his head a Greek cap, which made his large,
flushed features appear most prominent; his cue was wound with red
ribbon, the two ends streaming down his back, and red slippers on his
feet. Over the beautiful shirt were the rusty trace-chains, the hooks
of which chafed against the shawl at every motion of the horse.

After shaking his purse in the truckman's face, and boasting of his
riches, he next took it into his head to beg, and, pulling off his cap,
he knocked the top in, causing it to resemble a bowl.

""Christian people, one and all,"" cried he, in doleful accents, holding
out the cap, ""pity a poor, disenabled sailor, who's lost his legs
fighting for his country, whose father and mother are frying eggs in
a wooden saucepan on the rock of Gibraltar; pity him, good people, and
drop a shot in the lee locker.""

As he concluded, cheers arose from the crowd, and his shipmates flung a
shower of small coin into the cap, when, whirling it around his head,
the silver was scattered among the crowd, creating a universal scramble.

The truckman now wanted his horse.

""Your horse! You're drunk, old boy, and don't know what you're talking
about. I've chartered this 'ere horse for the vige, and the vige ain't
up yet. Ain't that so, shipmates?""

This declaration was followed by a cheer of assent. Captain Rhines,
meanwhile, was making strenuous efforts to get through the crowd, for
he had recognized in the sailor on horseback Dick Cameron, who had
been a great many voyages with him. Dick was an especial favorite with
Captain Rhines, for he was a splendid seaman when at sea and away from
liquors, and the captain would have been right glad to have met and
shaken hands with his old shipmate when sober, or to have entertained
him at his house; but he dreaded recognition by him in his present
state, and was striving to avoid it. Dick, however, caught sight of
him; for he was too conspicuous, by his size and noble physique, to
escape notice in a crowd.

Dick hailed him with shout and gesture that drew the eyes of all upon
him in an instant.

""Shipmates,"" he cried, ""as I'm alive and a sinner, if here ain't my
old cap'n, Cap'n Ben Rhines, the best man that ever sailed salt water;
as knows how to carry sail, and how to take in sail; none of your
kid-glove gentry! Ah, my boys, he's sailed for it! None of your ship's
cousins; a man as knows when a man does his duty, and how to keep good
dis-_cip_-line on board ship"" (emphasizing the second syllable of
""discipline,"" as seamen generally do). ""No humbugging, nor calling men
out of their watch or out of their names, on board his ship. God bless
you, cap'n! I thought you was dead and gone to heaven long ago. Ah,
cap'n, we've sailed the salt seas together round the Hook of Holland,
round Cape Horn, through the Straits of Gibraltar, and on the Spanish
Main. Haven't we had some tough ones on the coast? How are you, cap'n?""

""First rate, Dick. How are you, and where have you been all these years
since you disappeared in Calcutta? I thought you was overboard, or
knocked on the head with a slung shot; for I never believed you would
run away from me.""

""Run away from _you_, cap'n? I would run to you as I would to my mother
if she was alive, God bless her! I got a dose of sheet lightning, and,
when I waked up, I was aboard an English ship bound to Australia. What
become of my clothes? I had a good chistful.""

""I kept them aboard till I gave them all away to sailors that had been
robbed by the land-sharks.""

""Jest right, cap'n, jest like you. Now, shipmates, give me a fist. I
want to go ashore, and shake the cap'n's flippers.""

With their aid he dismounted, and, getting hold of the captain's hand,
which he extended most cordially, he continued to pour forth his
protestations of respect and affection.

""How is the wife, cap'n, and the pickaninnies, and that leetle boy of
yours, what's got Bunker Hill on his shoulders? Ah, shipmates, that's
the bully boy can bend a crowbar over his knee, and mast-head a topsail
alone.""

""They are all well. But where are you from, Dick?""

""Messina.""

""Have you spoke any American vessels on the coast?""

""Yes; two.""

""What were they?""

""West Indiamen from Antigua, bound into New London.""

""How long have you been ashore?""

""Since eight o'clock this morning--jest long enough to moisten the clay
a little.""

Here the conversation was interrupted by the truckman attempting to
lead off the horse, having received his pay in advance; but this
Dick's shipmates would by no means permit. One shook his fist in the
truckman's face, threatening to drive his teeth down his throat;
another seized the horse by the bridle, while two others caught hold of
his long tail.

""Catch a turn, Bill, round that timber-head.""

Bill caught a turn with the tail round a barber's pole that was set in
the ground before the door of a grog-shop, the barber occupying rooms
overhead. But the horse, not accustomed to being thus dealt with, began
to kick and jump, amid the cheers and laughter of the crowd, till he
pulled the pole over amongst them.

In order to restore good feeling, Dick now proposed to the truckman to
take some bitters.

""I say, Dick,"" said Bill Matthews, ""it seems to me as how you ought to
treat this 'ere horse.""

""So I will, shipmates, bless me if I don't,"" said Dick, who had
meantime been trying to persuade the captain to drink with him. ""If the
cap'n _won't_ drink, the horse _shall_;"" and, mounting, he intended to
ride him into the bar-room. The horse protested, and so did his owner,
but both alike without success. Despite his struggles, the beast was
pushed up three steps, into the bar-room.

""Mix him a good stiff glass, Tom,"" said Dick. ""He needs it.""

The bar-keeper, nothing loath, as he calculated to get his pay for
all the liquor poured out, whether drank or not, obeyed. The room was
crammed, all crowding in to see the fun and share the drinking, as Dick
had invited all hands; no change out of a dollar.

Captain Rhines might have escaped now; but he wished to make some
further inquiries of Dick. He was interrupted by the truckman calling
for his horse, and the disturbance that followed; so he remained on the
sidewalk.

Just as they were attempting to turn the liquor down the beast's
throat, the floor broke through with the great weight, and both horse
and crowd went into the cellar. None, however, were seriously injured.
Some were cut with broken glass of tumblers and bottles, some bruised
by the struggles of the horse: but, as usual, those drunkest fared the
best. Dick escaped unharmed, and the horse was not injured.

The captain now got hold of Dick again.

""Were those two West Indiamen all the vessels you saw or spoke?""

""All we spoke, cap'n; but there was one went by us, beating up the bay
yesterday arternoon, like as we had been lying at anchor.""

""What kind of a vessel?""

""A brigantine; a raal sharp-shooter,"" said Matthews.

""How painted?""

""All one color, spars and all, betwixt black and a lead color. I says
to Dick (we was on the fore-topsail-yard, freshening the sarvice on the
topgallant-sheet), 'Dick,' says I, 'that's some kind of a smuggler, or
slaver, or something. So handsome a clipper as that's not painted such
a color for nothing.'""

""Was she heavy sparred? Did she carry a press of sail?""

""She was all sail; long yards, and plenty of staysails and savealls, a
whacking mainsail, and a ringtail at the end of it. I noticed it,"" said
Dick, ""and spoke of it then, what a spread she had to her fore-rigging
and long spreaders on the cross-trees to spread the topgallant and
royal back-stays.""

""That must be the vessel I'm looking for; but if she passed you,
beating up, why ain't she here?""

""She went into Salem.""

""O, ho! went into Salem! Then it's her. The captain belongs in Salem;
and, as he had a head wind and tide, he went in there, and will be up
to-day.""

Captain Rhines had proceeded but a little way after leaving Dick,
when, just before him, a man was pushed out of the door of a sailor
boarding-house, and fell his whole length on the sidewalk. He rose
with difficulty to his feet as the captain came along, and addressed
him by name. He was covered with filth, his face bruised and bloody, a
battered tarpaulin on his head, a beard of three weeks' growth, clothed
in a red shirt, canvas trousers, and barefoot. He trembled like a man
with the fever and ague, evidently being in that state expressively
termed by sailors the ""horrors,"" and could scarcely stand.

""Cap'n,"" he cried, ""don't you know me?""

""No,"" he replied, after looking at him a moment, ""and don't want to.""

""I'm Percival, William Percival, that went mate of your ship with
Captain Aldrich.""

""Your own mother wouldn't know you, Percival. How came you in this
condition?""

""I've had hard luck, cap'n: been cast away; lost everything but what I
stood in.""

The captain was the last man to be imposed upon. He had always believed
that Percival and Aldrich both were two precious rascals, saw in an
instant what had reduced him to his present state, and that the story
of shipwreck was manufactured at the spur of the moment.

""You've cast yourself away,"" was the reply. ""You might have been master
of a ship if you had behaved yourself, and had any principle. Don't lie
to me. You've got the shakes on you this blessed minute.""

""That's so, cap'n,"" said the poor wretch, making a virtue of necessity;
""but I only drank to drown misery. O, cap'n,"" he cried, stretching out
his hands, which trembled like an aspen leaf, ""give me a quarter, just
to get a little rum to taper off with.""

""Not a cent. You've had too much now.""

""O, cap'n, dear cap'n, do,"" cried the miserable wretch; ""only a
fourpence ha'pp'ny, cap'n.""

""No.""

""Three cents, then, just to get one glass to taper off with.""

""Why don't you go and ship?""

""No cap'n will have me as I look now, when men are plenty.""

""I will give you victuals.""

""I can't eat, nor I can't sleep.""

""If I give you clothes, you'll sell them for rum.""

The captain was turning to leave him, when he said, ""I could tell you
something that would make you shell out the chink.""

The captain, paying no attention, kept on, when he cried, ""I can tell
you what became of that nigger you thought so much of.""

The captain whirled on his heel in an instant. ""What nigger?""

""Why, that was pilot in the Casco.""

""James Peterson?""

""Ay.""

""I _know_ what became of him. He was drowned between the vessel and the
wharf, in Martinique.""

""No, he wasn't.""

""What _did_ become of him?""

""I can tell you what became of him if I like?""

""I believe you lie.""

""Well, have it your own way, then.""

The captain mused a moment. He knew Aldrich and Percival well; that
there was no principle in either of them; had never believed the story
that Peterson was in liquor, and fell overboard, but always mistrusted
there had been some foul play. His suspicions were now thoroughly
aroused, and he determined to sift the matter to the bottom.

""Come along with me,"" he said.

The seaman followed the captain to a sailor boarding-house, kept by an
old acquaintance, with whom the latter had boarded when mate of a ship.

""Mr. Washburn,"" said he, ""I want you to oblige me by taking this man
in. He's got the 'horrors.' Give him liquor enough to taper off with,
clothes to make him decent, and look to me for pay.""

""I will, captain.""

He then said to Percival, ""Clean yourself up, and get a night's sleep.
I will come here to-morrow at ten o'clock; and, if I have reason to
think there's any truth in your statements, I'll do more for you.""

In the course of the afternoon the Arthur Brown came up with the flood
tide. It was a joyful meeting between Captain Rhines, Arthur Brown,
Walter, Ned, and the whole crew, who were all his neighbors. They spent
the evening talking over the events of the voyage, while the captain
made them acquainted with all that had taken place at home.

Seeing Captain Rhines was next to seeing their own parents, especially
to Ned, whose life he, with others, had saved. Ned got on one side and
Walter the other, and plied him with questions about everybody and
everything at home.

After retiring that night, the captain strove to recall all he had ever
heard said by any one of the crew who were in the Casco at the time of
the mysterious disappearance of Peterson, and recollected that Eaton,
who was a great friend to Peterson, said there had been some difficulty
between him and the captain on the passage out. He was sorely puzzled;
for, from the time he first heard of the occurrence, he had cherished
an opinion that somehow or other Aldrich was concerned in the matter;
still he could not help feeling that there was not the least evidence
of if, and that this opinion was based more upon his prejudice against
the captain than upon anything else; while he had no better opinion
of Percival than to believe he would trump up any kind of a story,
if there was the least possibility of its being believed, in order
to obtain money. At ten o'clock he was at Washburn's, where he found
Percival arrayed in a decent suit of seaman's clothes, clean, shaved,
his nerves steadied by liquor and a night's rest, and altogether
another man.

It is even now a mooted question among physicians whether, in delirium
tremens, to give moderate doses of liquor to ""taper off"" with, as it
is called, or not; but in those days there was but one opinion and one
mode of practice--to give the individual a hair of the dog that bit
him, which the captain had done.

""Now, Percival,"" said he, ""I am ready to hear what you have to say.""

""You see, Captain Aldrich was down on that nigger from the day he came
aboard the vessel.""

""What for?""

""I'm sure I don't know, except because everybody else liked him. He was
the best cook I ever see on board a vessel, and the best seaman; always
ready to lend a hand, night or day; knew his place, and kept it.""

""You've told the truth there, Percival.""

""I intend to tell the truth all the way through. There was a good deal
of hard feeling. The cap'n was overbearing. The men wouldn't stand it,
because there was no occasion for it. He came near having a row with
Eaton, but thought better of it, and one day he picked a quarrel with
the nigger.""

""And how did he come out with that?""

""Out of the little end of the horn, as they say. Peterson said some
pretty hard things about him and his folks, which the men said
afterwards was all true, and set out to fling him overboard. He run
aft, scared half to death.""

""I wish he had. He would have been no more in James Peterson's hands
than a peck of wheat bran.""

""Well, Aldrich was a very proud man, and it gravelled him terribly to
be put down by a nigger, and he was out with me, because I wouldn't
take his part. He laid it up. I heard him swear a hundred times that he
would be square with that nigger before he left Martinique, and he was
as good as his word.""

""He murdered him?""

""No, he sold him.""

""_Sold him!_ What do you mean by that?""

""I mean that he sold him into slavery.""

""The villain! I never should have thought of that. And was you a party
to it?""

""No.""

""Well, how was it managed?""

""It came about after this fashion. I don't think the cap'n thought
himself about selling him, but it was kind of flung in his way, and he
jumped at it like a dolphin at a flying-fish. Perhaps you know Peterson
was a first-rate calker?""

""Yes.""

""Well, there was a planter that lived on the other side of the island,
somewhere, who had a lot of drogers that brought sugar and coffee. One
day he was lying with his droger right under our stern, and Peterson
was on a stage, over the stem, calking. After that the planter came
on board, and I heard him say to Aldrich, 'Cap'n, I'll give you two
thousand in gold for that nigger.' The cap'n laughed, but said nothing.""

""The planter was joking,"" said Captain Rhines; ""I have had planters in
Cuba and Antigua say so to me a hundred times, when I've had Peterson
and other darkies with me.""

""I've no doubt he was, when he first spoke; but it put an idea into
Aldrich's head, and he carried it out. For some days after that, I saw
him and the planter Henri Lemaire always with their heads together on
the piles of boards, and saw them look at Peterson. Then they would
be together a long time in the cabin of his droger; and they had no
business with each other, for we hauled in to the government wharf,
because we sold our lumber to the government. This set me on the
lookout. I tried to listen, but couldn't get a chance to hear anything.
One night the cap'n sent Peterson ashore with letters, and he never
came back. Then I know he had sold him.""

""But he did come back. Danforth Eaton and all the crew told me that
there was a good fire in the fireplace; that he had got breakfast well
under way the next morning when they turned out, and had gone ashore,
as they supposed, to get something for his 'lobscouse,' and fell
overboard.""

""Peterson never made that fire, nor peeled the potatoes and onions, or
cut the pork and put it in the frying-pan; but he pounded the coffee
and chopped the beef the night before, for I saw him do it.""

""Who did the rest?""

""The cap'n did it himself.""

""The _captain_?""

""Ay. I had a tooth that grumbled, and didn't sleep well. I heard the
cap'n get out of his berth, like a, cat crawling after a squirrel, and,
having my suspicions, I followed him, and saw what he was up to--saw
him kindle the fire, put on the tea-kettle, and do all the other
things.""

""But his boy, Ben, told me that they found his handkerchief on the
fender.""

""True; but it was a handkerchief that he wore on his head when he was
cooking, and kept it on a nail before the fire, and the cap'n put it on
the fender himself. Besides, what did he want to send Peterson to the
office with letters that were blank, if it was not to make an errand to
get him ashore in the night, that he might be kidnapped?""

""_Blank letters?_""

""Ay. I peeked through the skylight, and saw him fold and direct them,
and there was not a word written in them.""

The captain rose and took a turn or two across the room. He was
a shrewd judge of men, had watched Percival closely during the
conversation, and was strongly inclined to believe all he said.

His account of the captain's relations with the ship's company tallied
precisely with what he had previously heard from the men, and it seemed
altogether improbable, if not impossible, that he could have originated
some of the statements.

""I have always suspected,"" said the captain, sitting down again,
""that there was foul play of some kind. I have known Ezra Aldrich
from the egg, and knew he was capable of any kind of villany; never
wanted him to go in the ship, but was overruled by others. If what
you say is true, it certainly looks like it. But how do you know that
he was sold? You have no proof. He might have been, and probably was,
murdered. There are plenty of renegade Spaniards in Martinique, and
Frenchmen, too, that would stab a man in in the back in the night for
two dollars. There was Enoch Freeman, of North Yarmouth, a cooper, had
a shop there for years, used to go out in the fall and come back after
it began to be hot (he went out with me a good many times), had some
difficulty with a Frenchman about coopering a cargo of sugar. He saw a
nigger hanging around his shop, and one of his men said to him, 'Mr.
Freeman, that nigger means to kill you.' Freeman walks right up to the
fellow, and says, 'What did that Frenchman offer you to kill me?' 'Two
dollars.' 'Go and kill him, and I'll give you four.' The nigger went
and killed him.""

""But I know he sold him.""

""How do you know?""

""Because he owned to me he did it.""

""How came he to be fool enough to do that?""

""We had some difficulty in Martinique.""

""How was that?""

""We were all discharged, and lay in the stream. The cap'n went ashore
in the morning, and left orders with me to send the boat for him at
four o'clock. He came on board drunk and ugly enough. As soon as he
got his head over the rail, he sings out, 'Why wasn't that boat sent
ashore, as I ordered?'

""'It was, sir.'

""'No, it wasn't. I ordered the boat to be on the beach at four; it was
five minutes after.'

""He then began to blow round deck, growl, curse, and find fault.

""'Why ain't those skids got ready,' he roared, 'to take in sugar? The
lighter will be alongside in the morning.'

""'They are ready, sir.'

""The skids were over the hatchway and blocked up.

""'Well, they ain't right.'

""'Yes, they are right, sir. I know how to rig skids to take in molasses
and sugar, and how to stow it afterwards, as well as you, or any other
man.'

""'You _do_--do you?'

""'Yes, sir. I do.'

""'Why ain't those head-stays set up, as I ordered, and chafing gear put
on the forestay in the wake of the topsail?'

""'There was not time, sir; the hold had to be cleared up, and the
dunnage piled up fore and aft, ready for taking in cargo.'

""'Why didn't you do it yourself, then?'

""'I didn't come here to work, sir.'

""'What did you come for?'

""'To see other folks work.'

""I now left him, and went below; but he came down into the cabin, and
began upon me again.

""'If you come here to see other folks work, why don't you do it? Why
didn't you send that foretopsail down, and have it mended? The duty of
the ship can't go on, if I am ashore seeing to my business.'

""I couldn't bear no more, but walked straight up to him, and, looking
him right in the eye, said, 'How about that nigger, Cap'n Aldrich? How
about those blank letters, those onions and potatoes I saw you peeling,
that handkerchief you put on the fender?' He changed countenance in a
moment, became as pale as a corpse, staggered, and caught hold of the
pantry door for support. I said no more, but went on deck.""

""What did he say afterwards. Did he ask you what you meant?""

""Never a word, but was as agreeable as could be, though he didn't
make much talk with me; but I was afraid he would poison me; didn't
drink any liquor all the passage for fear he might give me a dose, and
watched him as a cat would a mouse.""

""Pity you couldn't always have sailed with him. It might have made a
sober man of you.""

""One night, after we got in the edge of the gulf, he got crooking his
elbow again, and began to use bad language to me because I shortened
sail in my watch without consulting him. I just held up my fore-finger,
and said, 'Look here, my fine fellow: we are in the edge of the gulf.
I will hang you when we get in.' I then told him that I knew all
about his selling that nigger to Lemaire, that he had abused me in
Martinique, and on the passage thus far home, and I would have my
revenge; that the moment we made land, I would tell the crew, put him
in irons, and appear against him in court.""

""What did he say to that?""

""He was terribly frightened; said he was sorry he did it, but he
couldn't bear to be put down before the crew by a nigger; and that
he never should have thought of that way of getting revenge, if the
planter hadn't put it into his head; and wound up by telling me that he
would give me five hundred dollars to say nothing about it, when we got
in.""

""Then Peterson's alive, and a slave to this Lemaire?""

""Ay. The cap'n said, the moment he proposed to take him up, Lemaire,
was fierce for it; said that he owned a great many drogers and launches
that carried sugar, coffee, tortoise-shell, and other truck, and
he wanted him because he saw that he was a first-rate calker, and
calculated to keep him calking all the time.""

""Did you ever get your five hundred dollars?""

""No, sir; he put me off once or twice, and then cleared out while I was
on a spree.""

The captain now believed the story of Percival, for he had heard from
the crew that he and the captain had quarrelled, and of his coming
on board drunk in Martinique, and saying and doing just as Percival
said he did; he knew, also, that he disappeared suddenly and left the
country, although (through the influence of Isaac Murch) he was offered
the command of a vessel in Wiscasset. ""I think that your story seems
probable. At any rate, I'll do this much. I'll make arrangements with
the landlord in respect to your board for two weeks from to-day (no
rum, mind, for you are through with the horrors), and your outfit when
you go aboard some vessel. If I ever get hold of Peterson, or if he
dies there, and I find that you have told me the truth, there will be
time enough to do something more.""




CHAPTER XII.

THE NOBLE VOLUNTEERS.


Captain Rhines was occupied with business the remainder of the day,
and in the evening went aboard of the brigantine. The Arthur left
before the arrival of the Casco bringing tidings of the disappearance
of Peterson; consequently the ship's company had not heard of it till
informed by the captain, on the evening of their arrival. It therefore
excited no little astonishment and interest when they were informed
that he was sold for a slave in Martinique. After the affair had
been thoroughly discussed in all its bearings, the captain said, ""I
am getting somewhat the worse for wear, and when I went to Cuba on
the raft, I took leave of the sea, as I thought, forever; but James
Peterson saved my life once; and before a man like him (born a slave,
now an American citizen, and as noble-hearted a creature as ever drew
the breath of life) shall live and die a slave, perhaps feel the lash,
I'll risk these old bones once more, and spend the last dollar I've got
in the world.""

""Captain Rhines,"" cried Walter, leaping to his feet, ""you shan't go.
You ought not to go. I'll go. I, too, loved Peterson dearly. He carried
me in his arms when a child. I have spent weeks at his house. He made
all my playthings, and would do anything for our folks. I'll go, and
something tells me I shall succeed.""

""Count me in, too,"" cried Ned. ""I love everybody that Walter loves.
James was just like a father to me when I was wounded--sat up nights,
and did everything for me.""

""It is a great undertaking for persons of your age, and without much
experience; but, ever since you went from home, you have been put in
places where boys ripen fast, and always shown yourselves capable of
accomplishing whatever you undertook. You are going, too, upon a good,
I may say holy, errand, and may certainly expect aid and wisdom from
aloft. Have you thought of any plan, Walter?""

""No, sir; we are only boys, and must leave the direction of affairs
with you, who know everything.""

""I am a great ways from knowing everything,"" said the captain, smiling.
""We have been talking this matter over amongst ourselves the better
part of an hour and a half, and I don't think you made the offer you
have without some plan in your head upon which it was built.""

The captain made these remarks, wishing to draw Walter out.

""As I sat listening to your account,"" said Walter, ""it appeared to me
that, as Ned and myself had quite a little pile of money for boys of
our age, we could not spend part of it in any better manner than by
using it to restore Peterson to his family; that we might ship in some
vessel, before the mast, to Martinique, for low wages, to leave when we
got there. If we couldn't do that, work our passage; and, if no captain
would take us on that lay, pay our passage. As we both speak French
well, we should have no difficulty in finding the place where he is, if
alive.""

""How would you get him off, if you found him?""

""I suppose we must be governed by circumstances, when on the spot.""

""But you have probably thought of some way, if you should succeed in
getting hold of him, to get him and yourselves home?""

""I have heard Uncle John say,"" said Walter, ""that he has come out of
the West Indies in yellow fever time, when there was only one man
besides himself and his first and second mates fit for duty, and all
he could do was to sit in a chair and steer, and the crews of other
American vessels hove up the anchor and mast-headed the topsails for
them; and, as soon as they got to sea, they all began to come right up.
So, as it will be right in the sickly time of year, if we don't die
ourselves, there will be plenty of vessels short-handed that will be
glad enough to ship us.""

The captain, perceiving by the looks of Ned that he had some ideas in
respect to the matter in hand, but was too modest to speak, asked his
companion.

""Please, sir, I don't think my opinion would be of any value; but if
you will plan for us, sir, it will all go right.""

""I know you have some ideas, Ned, and I want to hear them. Speak up,
like a man. If you are going to risk your life, and spend hard-earned
money, you certainly are entitled to your opinions.""

Thus exhorted and encouraged, Ned, after some hesitation, said,--

""You know, sir, after you took us from the raft I was a long time at
Charlie Bell's, very weak and miserable--could only sit in a chair, and
walk about the room.""

""Yes.""

""Well, Charlie, in order to amuse me and pass the time, told me about
your going to Havana in the Ark; of the ventures you carried for him
and others. He told me what a lot of money was made on such simple
things as beets, onions, carrots, and potatoes, that are worth next to
nothing at home; that you made a lot on some hens, butter, candles, and
on beef--more, according to, than even on the lumber.""

""That is all so.""

""I hope you and Captain Brown will excuse me, sir, for presuming to
plan for people who know all about it. I was thinking that perhaps
by and by Walter and I might put our money together, build part of a
vessel, and go in her,--he master, and I mate; and that we ought, if it
is right, to keep our money, and get all we can to put with it. Not but
I am willing to spend the last dollar for James, if it is necessary;
but it seems to me it would be better to make money than to spend
money.""

""But how are you going to get James?""

""I was thinking, sir, if we could get a fore-and-after, a sloop, or
some kind of a vessel that we could handle, load her with something
that wouldn't be so bulky as lumber,--like those things you carried for
ventures,--so that a small vessel could carry a good deal of value, we
might get Peterson clear, and make money for ourselves likewise.""

""Bravo, my boy! That's a plan just as full of sense as it can be.""

""Then, you know, sir, we should have the vessel to get home with and
bring James in.""

""To be sure you would, and make a lot on your return cargo. What do you
think of that plan, Walter?""

""I think it is a first-rate plan, sir.""

""This little chap that you and all of us have been petting, and calling
little Ned so long, is outgrowing his teachers. He'll be taking the
wind out of your sails by and by.""

""There's nothing lost that a good friend gets,"" said Walter, putting
his arm round Ned.

""Well said. It's a principle I have always acted upon.""

""It struck me, while Ned was speaking, that if we carried such kind
of freight as he suggests, why not go and peddle it out at some of the
small ports. What is to hinder going to the plantation of this very
Lemaire, and swap our truck for his, get the right side of him, and
that would give us a first-rate opportunity to get at Peterson.""

""So you could. Nobody but a Yankee would have thought of that; whereas,
if you should go hanging round there without any business, you would be
suspected in a moment, watched, and perhaps shot or stabbed.""

""Allow me to make a suggestion,"" said Captain Brown.

""Certainly; the more heads the better.""

""Does that Lemaire _own_ those drogers, or only go in them?""

""Owns them! Man alive, he owns three estates and four or five hundred
niggers. I've sold him lumber, bought sugar and coffee of him, and they
say he treats his slaves well, and gives them a chance to earn money
for themselves, and buy their freedom.""

""Then he must have to buy a great many spars for drogers' masts. Why
not take a deck-load of spars and the other stuff in the hold? Then
he would be sure to trade with you, especially if you gave him a good
bargain. If he didn't want all the spars at once, he could pile them
up.""

""Those drogers are large, and require quite a large stick for masts. It
would take a larger vessel than the boys could handle. You can't keep
them on hand in that climate. If you pile them up, they rot; if you put
them in the salt water, the worms will eat them up in sixty days.""

""Captain,"" said Sewall Lancaster, ""may I speak in meeting?""

""Free your mind, brother.""

""Wal, what's the matter they couldn't take frames all ready to put up
for nigger quarters, small timbers not very bulky, sell 'em, not by the
foot, but for so much right out? I was out there three years ago in the
John and Frederick, with old Cap'n Treadwell. No! How time runs away!
'Twas four years ago this very month, because it was three days before
we sailed, that Lion Ben sarved Joe Bradish such a rinctum.""

""What was that?"" asked Captain Brown; ""let us hear it, Lancaster.""

""Wal, you see the Lion, besides being so all-fired strong, is a great
teamster; they say the greatest in town (now Uncle Isaac Murch is
gone). He won't abuse an ox, neither, nor let anybody else; but Joe
(he's no teamster at all, nor much else; when he gits stuck, he takes
off the forrard cattle), he can't make four oxen pull together; he's
real cruel, too. I've seen him stand with one foot on the tongue, and
the other on an ox's back, and beat him with a stake. Wal, he got to
the foot of Merrithew's Hill with a heavy load and four oxen; the
cattle wouldn't haul for him; he licked his goad up about 'em, and
hollered, and screeched, and cursed. They wouldn't haul; he looked
round for a stake, but it was stone wall both sides of the road, and
he had to go a good ways down, over the first little rise, to get one.
Lion Ben comes to the top of the hill; he'd heard the screeching; saw
the team standing there. Frank Chase told me this; he was picking rocks
in their field, and saw the whole of it. He said the Lion came along,
went to the cattle, patted 'em, lifted up the yokes, pulled up a last
year's mullein stalk, flourished that over 'em a few times, put his
pretty little shoulders to the wheel, and spoke to the cattle. Frank
said he didn't speak loud enough for him to hear; and they went right
up the hill with it; then Ben squats down behind the log fence. Joe
came back with his stake to whale 'em, and there was no team there.
Frank said it was comical enough to see him rub his eyes and stare
round. Bime by he went up the hill. There was his team. Frank said he
looked under the load, on the top of the load, and everywhere. Frank
held his tongue, and Joe allers thought that the cattle started for
fear of the licking they would get when he come back.""

""Did he ever find out?"" asked Walter.

""Yes; the Lion met him one night at the store, and told him, before all
hands, that if ever he saw him beat cattle with a stake, or heard tell
on't, he'd pay his respects to him. I reckon you kin guess what Lion
Ben's respects would be.""

""All the satisfaction,"" said the captain, ""I wish of the villain that
sold and the villain that bought Peterson is, that Ben might get his
mud-hooks on them both. If the blood and brains wouldn't fly when he
smashed their heads together, I'll never guess again. But about the
frames, Sewall?""

""Wal, the upshot was, the planters almost quarrelled to see who should
git 'em, they were so taken with 'em, and gave him his own price. The
old man said he wished he'd loaded with 'em.""

""Just the things for us, Sewall,"" said the captain. ""I've heard people
speak in meeting, when I thought they had better have held their
tongues, but you have spoken to the purpose.""

""The old cap'n,"" continued Lancaster, ""said he might have made his jack
if he had only brought bolts, locks, and cheap hinges for doors, cause
sometimes they want to lock the darkies up; and also if he had brought
handsome ones for the planters' houses, and nails, he might have
thribbled his money; but that his wits allers come afterwards he seemed
quite in a passion about it, cause he hadn't made more, when he'd made
enough a'ready to satisfy any reasonable person.""

""Thank you, Sewall; we'll try and not have our wits come afterwards.""

""The greatest difficulty with me at the outset,"" said Walter, ""is,
where to find a vessel.""

""I'll settle that matter at once--charter the Perseverance of Ben. I
can rig her so that nothing of her size can catch her; and a better
sea-boat never swam. No matter how hard it blows; she'll lay to like a
duck, go dry, and work to windward all the time.""

""She may do well in the bays and along shore, bit she is old, and must
be rotten.""

""Last fall Ben took her over to Pleasant Cove. He, John, and Charlie
overhauled her thoroughly, made a winter's job of it, put in new
ceiling, drove a lot of fastening into her, laid a new deck, and put
in a new mainmast and bowsprit. All the rot they found was under the
bowsprit and two timbers in the counter. While I am here, I am going
to get new rigging and sails for her. Ben would have her name put on
in gold leaf. I thought it was nonsense for a fisherman; but he sets
his life by that craft because she belonged to his nearest friend, John
Strout, who was drowned.""

""But will Mr. Ben let us have her?""

""Tell him that James Peterson is a slave in Martinique, and that you
want the schooner to go out there and rescue him, and see whether he
won't let you have her.""

""Don't it seem a pity, Captain Rhines,"" said Ned, ""when such awful
things are done as Aldrich did, that there couldn't be somebody like
Lion Ben around, to give them just what they deserve?""

""There is somebody round.""

""Yes, sir; but he don't interfere.""

""Not all the time, perhaps. He has no occasion to be in haste, but can
lay his hand on a villain next year, or a hundred years from now, as
well as to-day. Depend upon it, my boy, Aldrich will get his broth as
hot as he can sup it, and, perhaps, a good deal of it as he goes along.""

""O, I am so glad we are going to have the Perseverance, not only
because she is fast and a good sea-boat, but it was her that you took
us off the raft with.""

""Yes, my brave sailor-boy,"" said the captain, taking Ned on his knee
(for his jovial, sanguine temperament was stirred to its depths by the
safe arrival of the brigantine, the prospect of liberating Peterson,
and the noble sentiments and practical ability manifested by the boys),
""had not the schooner been just where I could lay my hand upon her,
you must have perished; nor do I know of another vessel, that, in
such a sea and wind, would have towed the raft clear of the breakers;
indeed, it was touch and go. Had the foremast gone overboard three
minutes before it did, you would not be sitting on my knee to-night. I
was frightened myself, after I was safe on shore, and the pressure was
taken off.""

""A penny for your thoughts, Mr. Griffin,"" observed Captain Brown,
noticing that Walter was preoccupied.

""Out with it, my boy,"" said Captain Rhines.

""I was thinking over something Sewall's conversation put in my head,
not clear to me. I have not got it shaped as yet. But if we can get to
Martinique with the kind of cargo Sewall speaks of, and Peterson is
alive, I feel sure that I know what to do when there.""

""What is that?"" asked Captain Rhines, pointing to the companion-way.

""It's daylight,"" said Ned; ""we've talked all night; it is break of
day.""




CHAPTER XIII.

CAPTAIN RHINES AND DICK CAMERON.


During the day they were occupied in discharging cargo, were tired
at night, and turned in early to make up their sleep. But the night
following the same company assembled again in the cabin of the Arthur.

""Now,"" said Captain Rhines, ""for the crew.""

""Ned and I are officers and crew,"" said Walter; ""we can handle her.""

""You could handle her in good weather, or in a gale of wind, if it gave
you time, but you might lose your masts in a sudden squall; besides,
you must have more than one in a watch. You must have a lookout, and
you might have a scuffle to get Peterson. You must have two men, and
a boy for a cook: one stout, reliable man, an able seaman, and an
ordinary, or stout, smart boy, eighteen or nineteen. One of you may be
sick, or washed overboard. However, there's time enough for that. I
think I know where to find the able seaman.""

A week after this Captain Rhines takes a walk to ""Black Dog Alley.""

""Where is Dick Cameron?"" he inquired of the bar-keeper.

""On that bench,"" pointing to a wooden settee, on which lay Dick, drunk
and sound asleep.

""Been out all night?""

""Ay.""

""Got the 'horrors'?""

""Never has 'em; head's too hard.""

""I suppose you had his advance.""

""Yes.""

""How much money has he left?""

""When his board is paid, Saturday night, he'll have three dollars and
some cents left.""

""Has he sold or pawned his clothes?""

""No. He has boarded with me, off and on, a good many years, and I never
knew him to do that.""

""Well, will you ask him to meet me at Washburn's at four o'clock this
afternoon?""

""I will.""

At the appointed time the captain found Dick on the spot.

""Dick, how many times, since we have been acquainted, have I told you
that you was an out-and-out fool?""

""Shiver my limbs if I know, cap'n; mayhap as many times as there are
yarns in the best bower cable.""

""It has done a great deal of good. You are just the same old sixpence
you were when you sailed with me, fifteen years ago.""

""Well, cap'n, you take a little something when you have a mind. Why
shouldn't an old sailor--that nobody cares anything about, and that's
going to be thrown overboard when he's worn out, just like the cook's
hot water and ashes--take his comfort while he can? I tell you, cap'n,
you don't know anything about it. It ain't so easy to get clear of your
shipmates. Here's mayhap half a dozen, or mayhap twenty-five of us,
been on a long vige or a short vige. We come ashore; go to a boarding
house. They treats me. Of course I must treat them. One glass brings on
another, till we are all blind drunk.""

""_Don't_ I know all about it? Haven't I been through it all? Wasn't I a
sailor, before the mast, years and years?""

""Not such a sailor as Dick Cameron, poor, God-forsaken devil. When you
got into port, you had something ahead. You had a good home, father,
mother, brothers and sisters, way back in the bush, that you carried
to sea with you in your heart. When you turned in, and when you turned
out, they turned in and turned out with you. They were close by you all
the while. When you was at the wheel, on the lookout, or walking the
deck in the middle watch, they were there. When you got farther along
you thought of that young wife, dutiful woman, the little children, the
trees you had planted; and though, mayhap, your body was in Trieste,
Antigua, or Calcutta, your heart was at home with the wife and the
little ones. You could see their faces, hear the fire snap. The moment
you got in, and the vessel was made fast, the grass didn't grow under
your feet till you was at home. You didn't see anything else. You
looked right over everything else to that home.""

""That is true, Dick, every word of it.""

""You see, cap'n, with all these shrouds, and head-stays, and back-stays
to hold you up, you could take your liquor in moderation, and stop when
you had enough. But here's old Dick comes ashore. He's no parents,
no home; nothing but his shipmates. They go to a rum mill. He's a
drunkard, they are drunkards, and you know the rest. I drew up a strong
resolution this time. Before I come ashore, says I to myself, 'I'll
take my glass in moderation, just as my old cap'n, Ben Rhines, used to,
and not make a beast of myself.' But it all ended in smoke.""

""I don't take my glass in moderation, Dick. I've knocked off; flung it
all overboard. Ben has done the same. We don't drink, nor keep it in
the house.""

""That's a go, now! Slipped the cable, and let the end run out the
hawse-hole?""

""Yes, Dick; and haven't buoyed the cable, neither.""

""But what was the need of that? You never abused yourself with liquor.
You could stop at the score.""

""Ben begun it. You know John Strout, who was such a great friend of
his.""

""Was mate of the Leonidas?""

""The same. Well, he fell overboard drunk, after getting his liquor at
Ben's house. Ben swore then that he'd never drink another drop, and he
never has. I held out a good while; but at length I found I was making
drunkards of the young folks by the wholesale. They had no idea of
imitating old Uncle Yelf, who died drunk among the pigs; but they were
going to do like Captain Rhines, who drank in moderation; and three
fourths of them ended in becoming drunkards.""

""This is all very fine for you, cap'n; but here's poor Dick comes
ashore, goes into a boarding-house. If he don't drink, his shipmates
tell him he's no part of a man. The landlord tells him, says he, 'Dick,
you're a disgrace to the place. You're taking the shingles off the
house, the shoes off my children's feet. You must drink for the good of
the house.' I've no home to go to, no place to be decent in.""

Our readers must recollect this was long before the era of ""sailors'
homes.""

""Look here, my old web-foot,"" said the captain, bringing down his hand
on Dick's shoulder with a force that would have made a less stalwart
man wince; ""you shall have a place to be decent in. You shall go home
with me.""

""_Go home with you_, cap'n! What could you do with such a rough
customer as me? I should scare your family. You wouldn't try to make
a farmer of an old shell-back. I might, perhaps, do something with
horses, for my father carried the king's mail from Greenock; and, since
I was knee high to a toad, I have been used to horses; but it's little
old Dick knows about your horned cattle.""

""I'll tell you what I want of you. Have you forgotten James Peterson,
that used to go with me?""

""I never had any shipmate of that name that I knows of.""

""Yes, you had. He was a negro. I used to hire him of his master. He was
with us in the James Welch to Cadiz the time I had the big dog.""

""I don't mind any nigger, only Flour.""

""Well, it's _Flour_ I mean. His real name is Peterson.""

""Ay, I mind him well, and liked him well.""

""You know the blacks are free here at the north since the war.""

""I've heard so. Then they are a mighty sight better off than the
sailors.""

""He went out of here to Martinique, with a great villain, in one of our
vessels. I coaxed him to go, because it was hard to get a crew; and the
rascal has sold him to a planter there. I am going to have him back.""

""If you can get him.""

""I shall get him.""

""Why don't you get your government to demand him of the French
government, if he's a citizen, and save the expense and trouble?""

""They have no government that amounts to anything. They don't like us
because we won't go into a war with England on their account. Peterson
might die of old age, and I likewise, before they could be got to move
in the matter. Ben has got a vessel that sails like a witch; she has
been repaired this winter past; we are going to put new rigging and a
new suit of sails on her; and two of our boys have volunteered to take
charge, and go after Peterson, and get him back by hook or by crook.""

""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you to go home with me. You, myself, and Ben will cut and make
the sails, rig and load her. You will live in my family, get all the
salt junk and bad rum out of you, be amongst steady people, away from
temptation, go out in the vessel with the boys, and, perhaps, a couple
more of our young men; no rum, no landlords, no drunken shipmates. I'll
give you better wages than you ever had in your life, because you
shall have a share of the profits when the voyage is up. I'll build you
a vessel; and, as you are no navigator, you shall coast along the shore
in her, Captain Richard Cameron, marry some one of our good girls,
and be a man. Is not there a chance to be decent? and do as I have
done--let the liquor alone.""

""God bless you, cap'n; will you do all that for old Dick?""

""I will, and there's my hand on it.""

The seaman grasped the extended hand of his benefactor, exclaiming,
""I'll do it, cap'n. Don't think the manhood is all so leached out of me
by rum and bad company that I can't rally with such a motive as that.""

""I don't want you to feel that the obligation is all on one side. It
is not so. I know you, Richard Cameron, through and through; you are a
cool, resolute, powerful, noble-hearted man. I never expected to meet
you again; but I have always said, that, in a real trying time, you
were worth any two men I ever had. I can't help thinking you have been
sent to help me at this present time. You have had experience, and are
seasoned to all climates and all kind of hardships, and you may have to
throttle somebody.""

""I don't profess to be much of a saint, cap'n; but, if there's any
throttling to do, I am as good as the next one.""

""Well, take your dunnage, and come right on board the brigantine.
There's room enough and grub enough. You'll get acquainted with the
boys, and be out of harm's way.""

After listening to the story of Percival, the captain had written
to his wife, recounting all the particulars. Such a commotion as it
created in the quiet community of Pleasant Cove has rarely been seen.
Peterson was known and liked by every one. The story, with all manner
of additions and exaggerations, flew from mouth to mouth, increasing
as it went, formed the staple of conversation at every fireside, and
excited universal concern and indignation. It was asserted that he was
compelled to work every day with a ball and chain fastened to his leg,
and flogged till the blood ran. Persons who would hardly have spoken
to him if they had met him on the street before his misfortune were
outrageous at this violation of the rights of an American citizen. Any
number of plans were devised; some were for bringing the matter before
President Washington at once; others proposed to raise money to ransom
him; but it was finally concluded to wait till Captain Rhines came
home, who, no one doubted, would stir at once in the matter.

Sewall Lancaster expressed his willingness to go, and Captain Rhines
gladly accepted him, as he was well acquainted in Martinique and with
their trade; and, two days after the Arthur Brown was discharged, the
captain, with the boys and seamen, started in a coaster for Pleasant
Cove.

They found everything ripe and ready for their purpose. Lion Ben told
the boys they were welcome to the schooner, and refused to receive a
cent of remuneration.

The whole community rose up as one man to load her. Every household
contributed its supply of butter, candles, and vegetables.

Captain Rhines said if they were going round to the plantations it was
no use to carry fowl, as there were enough there; but they took a few
to sell in St. Pierre, as everybody was eager to contribute something,
and some who had nothing else could furnish fowls.

Twenty-five young men, with Charlie Bell at their head, went into his
woods, cut down the trees, rolled them into the pond, floated them
to the saw-mill, sawed them into joist, and framed the small houses.
Others contributed money to buy locks, hinges, and nails.

The boys were not permitted to contribute a cent, it being agreed on
all sides that whatever was made should be divided between the rescuers
and Peterson's family. Captain Rhines had also brought with him in the
coaster from Boston a large lot of spermaceti candles, which Arthur
Brown, Mr. Welch, and the crew of the brigantine contributed.

I trust you will not think that Captain Rhines, Lion Ben, and the boys
were idle amid all this commotion. You may believe this experienced
seaman, and the boys, full of enthusiasm, made the Perseverance look
saucy enough. Dick Cameron was in the right place now. As they sewed on
the sails, he told yarns that excited as much laughter as wonder; for
Dick, as our readers may suspect, was a jolly soul, and, as he was in
agreeable company, had a clear conscience, was full of good resolutions
and new-born hopes, a happier fellow you never saw. They grafted,
hitched, and pointed every rope on board of her that admitted of it,
even to the bucket-rope, and holy-stoned the deck till it was white
as snow. Didn't they put the muslin on her--a bonnet on her jib for
light winds, a lug foresail that trimmed way aft to the tiller-head, a
squaresail that travelled on an up-and-down stay, and two gaff-topsails
that set from the deck? These were all kites for light winds, and could
be set or taken in very quick. I wish you could have seen her boat. The
readers of the Elm Island Stories know very well that Charlie Bell was
by no means slow as respected boat-building, and was a complete epitome
of progress.

Just after they began to repair the Perseverance, his old father said
to him one day, as they sat before the fire,--

""Charlie, they have a new fashion of building boats in France.""

""How is that, father?""

""Why, instead of doing as you do, and getting natural crooks for
timbers, they saw them out of a white-oak plank, or whatever kind of
wood they make them of, put them into a steam-box, and bend them. They
generally get natural crooks for stem, stern-post, and floor-timbers;
but often they saw them out of plank, because timber is not so plenty
there as here, and necessity has driven them to it.""

""I see, father,"" said Charlie, ""you could build two boats in that way
while you were building one in our fashion.""

Charlie instantly set to work, at odd jobs, to build a boat for the
Perseverance that should take the fly off of everything. It was a labor
of love, because he meant to make a present of it to Lion Ben, and felt
all the enthusiasm naturally connected with new ideas.

He made the stem, stern-post, sharp-risers, and floor-timbers of apple
tree, which takes a very good polish, and the other timbers from plank
sawed out of small, second-growth white-oak butts, tough enough for
ox-goads, and as blue as a whet-stone. The excellent quality of the
wood enabled him to secure sufficient strength, and yet make them quite
small and neat. She was planked with the best of cedar.

He then made a fancy rudder, fancy oars, mast, and boom, and
painted her white to correspond. As she was small, Lion Ben made a
shoulder-of-mutton sail for her, which shape brought the body of the
sail low in the boat, enabling her to carry it much longer. She was
just the prettiest, lightest thing imaginable; and she would streak it
with a good breeze. After work at night, the boys did enjoy sailing in
her. Pleasantly and swiftly did these days pass away. They hardly ate
two meals in the same house; for they were universal favorites, and all
wanted to have the boys at their houses, and it was only on Sabbath
days that Walter spent the day at home.

Again he sat beside Charlie Bell in the old church, and had many a
pleasant talk with him; but Walter was obliged to tell Charlie, that,
although he had often thought of that moonlight talk by the brook, and
how vividly, among the crumbling ruins of the old castle, the power
of association recalled that conversation, he had complied with his
request no farther than to repeat the Lord's Prayer with Ned then, and
ever after when he retired to rest.

The Perseverance was now ready for sea; as Dick Cameron said,
everything about her was ship-shape and Bristol fashion. Never did more
good wishes and fervent prayers follow a craft than followed her, as,
with a wholesale breeze, she weighed anchor, and went down the bay
like a race-horse. Reluctantly the crowd of spectators left the heights
from which they had watched her as she faded from view, and slowly
sought their different places of abode.




CHAPTER XIV.

WALTER AND HENRI LEMAIRE.


To make a quick passage was the great desire of all on board the
schooner from various motives, the most prominent of which was to
break the fetters of Peterson at the earliest opportunity; but they
also burned to show themselves equal to the occasion, and justify the
expectations formed of them, well aware that the attention of the
whole community, and those whom they loved best, was fixed upon them.
Time was also precious, us they could not tell how much time might be
occupied in the search and rescue at Martinique, and it was of the
greatest importance to get away from there before the hurricane months.

With new rigging and masts, new sails, and plenty of them, a clean
bottom, and a wholesale breeze, the gallant little craft, that had been
employed on so many errands of mercy, and with which so many pleasant
associations were connected, nobly seconded the eager wishes of her
young navigators, and sustained her previous reputation.

""Don't them 'ere sails set like a board, and don't she travel, the
jade?"" shouted Dick, in ecstasy, as Agamenticus grew dim in the
distance, and the stars came out one by one; ""we shall have to heave
to for the wind. That's the time o' day, shipmate,"" he cried, as a
rooster, sticking his head between the slats of a coop, uttered a
shrill note of defiance. ""Doctor"" (cook), ""don't kill that chap. We'll
keep him to crow when we get the nigger.""

It was the intention of Captain Rhines to have taken one of Peterson's
boys for cook; but Ben was in the Casco, with Isaac Murch, and the boy
next in age had sailed for Berbice, in a Kennebunk ship, the day before
Captain Rhines returned from Boston. They, therefore, shipped a black,
who, like Peterson, had been a slave, and was formerly owned by Henry
Merrithew's father. His name being Neptune, they called him Nep for
short.

Captain Griffin (though, for convenience, we shall continue to call him
Walter) and Dick were in one watch, Mr. Gates (little Ned) and Sewall
Lancaster in the other. It was not a very aristocratic arrangement;
for the captain and mate worked ship, and took their tricks at the
helm, although Dick and Sewall were very particular in addressing
them by their titles; and, when the captain was on deck, Ned was as
scrupulous about taking the weather-side of the quarter-deck as though
he had been aboard the largest ship.

At daybreak of the ninth day, they made Mount Pelee in the distance,
and soon after sighted the north-western part of Martinique, and saw a
big rock, and a flat point, with a plantation on it.

""This,"" said Lancaster, ""is Point Precheur, and the rock Pearl Rock.""

It was not long before they made the white awnings of the vessels in
the harbor of St. Pierre, the principal commercial port of Martinique.
This island belongs to France, is about thirty-five miles long, and of
irregular shape, rocky, somewhat mountainous, abounding in intricate
coves and creeks of difficult navigation, but affording excellent
sheltered harbors for vessels both of large and small burdens. The soil
is fertile, and water abundant; the population ninety-nine thousand, of
whom seventy-eight thousand are negroes. It is subject to earthquakes
and hurricanes at certain seasons of the year.

Captain Rhines had given Walter particular directions about taking care
of the vessel at St. Pierre, which is an open roadstead. The town is
built on the side of a hill which falls off towards the water, forming
a circular beach. The shore being bold, vessels moor head and stern,
with anchors carried out to the south-east and north-west. Lumber
is rafted to the eastern portion of the harbor, where the water is
shoaler, and merchandise from the shore is brought off in launches. For
special reasons, the boys were in no haste to sell, and went ashore to
look at the place.

The town presented a singular appearance, being built in such a manner
upon the declivity of the hill, that from the vessel you saw a good
part of one house over the roof of the one in front, while steeper
hills behind seemed to overhang the houses.

The roofs of their houses were covered with tiles, which excited
Walter's curiosity to see how they were made, as he was always
interested in everything of a mechanical nature. So he clambered up on
to the roofs, and found the tiles were of two kinds: some were shaped
like a gouge, or half of an earthen pot. A row of these were laid,
hollow side up, the length of the roof, and two or three inches apart,
to economize stock; then others laid hollow side down to cover the
space between the others, and direct the water into the hollow of those
first laid; and so on, till the roof was covered.

Multitudes of bats find a lodgment under the tiles covering the joints,
and come out as twilight comes on.

Other tiles were made the shape of the letter S, the extremity of one
lapping the hollow of the other. These tiles were made of strong,
coarse pottery, of different colors, red predominating, and were laid
in mortar.

The houses of the negroes and the poorer class of whites were merely
four bamboo posts, stuck in the earth, the walls formed of wicker-work,
and plastered with mud, and the roofs thatched with cane leaves.

There had been a rain the day before, and the water was running in
streams from the hills, in paved gutters, through the middle of the
streets. The next morning presented a curious spectacle. It seemed as
though the entire population had been seized with a desire to wash.
Negro nurses were bringing children of all ages and colors down to the
beach, and washing them; infants in arms, and those who could just go
alone; while men were washing horses, asses, and mules. Hosts of boys,
black, white, and mulatto, were swimming with a facility and grace
quite wonderful. Whenever they could obtain permission, they would dive
from the masts, and even top-gallant-yards, of the vessels, in some
seventy feet in height, going down feet foremost, with their hands
close to their sides.

Going to the market, the boys witnessed a singular sight. The
market-men were not allowed to kill any animal before five o'clock
in the afternoon, nor sell any fresh meat after ten in the morning.
Whatever was left at that time they were obliged to rub with salt, and
dry in the shade. Near to a butcher's stall a bullock was tied. The
butcher, finding he was likely to fall short of meat that morning, runs
out, and thrusts a sharp-pointed knife into the marrow of the bullock's
neck, just back of the horns. The creature dropped in a moment.

The butcher and his assistants instantly began to skin him, cutting the
flesh from the ribs, thighs, and brisket as fast as they skinned, and
selling it hot from the bones, the skin and flesh being stripped from
the bones before the entrails were removed. Then the bones were cut up
in short pieces, tied in little bunches, and sold for a few sous, or a
bit (twelve cents), to poor people, for soups. All sorts of coin were
current there.

Walter went to the market to buy some fruit; there were twenty-five
cents in change due him, and the negro gave him a triangular piece of
silver.

""What is this?"" asked Walter.

""Makkatena,"" replied the black; ""he be two bit.""

Upon examination, he found a Spanish dollar had been cut into four
equal parts, and, upon inquiry, ascertained that one way they procured
small change was to cut dollars, half dollars, and quarters into four
pieces, which they called ""makkatena.""

""Sewall,"" said Walter, when he returned on board the vessel, ""the
story, at first, was, that Peterson fell between the vessel and the
wharf. I don't see a wharf here.""

""They sold their lumber to the government, and there was a breastwork
belonging to them. Joe Elwell said it was torn to pieces by the sea.
Nothing of that kind will stand here after the middle of July, when the
hurricanes come.""

They were now surrounded by bumboat-men, wanting to buy vegetables;
and the captain, who was much ashore, had several offers for his
lumber; but he seemed in no haste to sell; thought he should go round
to some of the plantations and small villages along the coast; didn't
know but he should go to Precheur, Case Pilote, or Case de Navire;
might go to Port Royal. Trinity Bay, or to the plantations near Carvel
(Caravelle); meant to try the market; guessed he had the right sort
of things; shouldn't wonder at all if he went to Guadaloupe; rather
thought he should; guessed that was the best market. In the mean time,
he retailed a few hens, some vegetables, and a little butter.

The captain was also very liberal to the blacks, especially to those
belonging to launches and drogers, giving them beef and biscuit, which
they carried off in the top of their high-crowned hats. The whole
ship's company were very sociable, particularly with the free negroes.
The result of this was, that the vessel was thronged with negroes. One
old black, a bumboat-man, terribly pock-marked, and his wool white with
age, was very intimate with Nep, in consequence of which he got many a
fritter and cup of coffee, and bought the cook's slush.

He also did a great many errands for the captain, was half the time on
board the vessel, and often invited Nep to his house on Sundays. He was
constantly telling about going to Point Solomon, where he had a good
many negro acquaintances; so Lancaster christened him Solomon, to which
name he answered as readily as to his own.

Lion Ben told Walter, the day they sailed, that he might sell the boat,
buy some cheap affair that would answer to come home with, and divide
the money between himself, Ned, and the crew. Many were the offers he
had for this boat: he refused them all.

""Why don't you sell her?"" asked Dick Cameron.

""I have good reasons for not doing it,"" was the reply.

""Solomon,"" said the captain one afternoon, as the old negro sat on the
heel of the bowsprit, enjoying a cigar, ""how old are you?""

""Golly, massa, dunno. How much be two hunder?""

""As much again as one hundred.""

""Den s'pose I be two hunder.""

""No, you ain't two hundred, or one hundred. What makes you think you
are so old?""

""'Cause eberybody say, when come to de vessel, 'Dere come de old
bumboat-man.' I go 'long de street: dey say, 'Dere go ole Quambo.'
Eberybody gone I knowed; cap'ns all dead, vessels all dead, too; one,
two, tree massas--all be dead. Last massa, he be sick; he say, 'Gib old
Quambo his freedom; he ole nigger, all wear out; only fit eat plantin.'
Dat one die; his chillen all die. Ole Quambo live yet, run de bumboat,
buy de slush, sell plantin, bananas, eat fish Sunday. Yah, yah, yah!
S'pose Gorra mighty forget all about ole Quambo. Yah, yah, yah!""

""How long have you been a bumboat-man?""

""Dunno, massa cap'n. S'pose half hunder year.""

""O, pshaw! no, you haven't half of it. Captains that follow this trade
don't live long, and perhaps the vessels you used to know are not worn
out, but have gone to some other island. Do you board all the vessels
that come here?""

""Yes, massa, ebery one. Dey lets me hab de slush. All de cap'n know ole
Quambo.""

""Do you remember an American vessel, the Casco, that, came here last
year?""

""Bery big ship, massa. Nebber so big ship here, only men-o'-war.""

""Yes; do you remember her?""

""Yes, massa. Bring great pile o' boards; goberment buy it all. Me hab
her slush. Sell many tings to de crew; dey hab plenty ob money.""

""Did you know the cook?""

""He black man; bery large; white on his hair. Me buy de slush ob him.""

""What was his name?""

""Dunno, massa; old man no 'member. He lose part ob de small finger on
de right hand.""

""Just so. He was drowned. Do you remember their trying to find him on
the bottom?""

""Dat man nebber drowned, massa; he libe now.""

""How do you know that?""

""Sometime, when hurricane months come, no vessel. Me go to de houses,
sell de candles me buy ob de 'Merican sailors; me go to Pierre
Lallemont's house; hear him tell de wife dat man no dead; he sold to de
Frenchman on de plantation.""

""What Frenchman?""

""Dunno, massa; no 'member.""

""Who is Pierre Lallemont?""

""He free nigger; cooper; make much money; hab niggers hisself.
Eberybody know Pierre.""

""I guess that's a story, Solomon, that somebody got up to hear
themselves talk. The captain and crew all said he was drowned. It is
likely they knew best.""

""S'pose so, massa.""

Here ended Walter's questioning of Solomon, who certainly did not
resemble his namesake in wisdom. Walter told Nep to give Solomon half a
dozen biscuit, and send him ashore. After the old man had been gone a
while, he said to Cameron,--

""Dick, take the cook's axe, and stave in the head of that empty
water-cask that stands on end abreast the main batch.""

""It's a good cask, sir,"" amazed at the order from so prudent a man as
Walter.

""No matter; do as I tell you.""

""Obey orders if you break owners,"" said Dick; and in went the head of
the cask.

""Cut the upper hoops off that beef-barrel.""

Dick did as he was ordered.

""Take Sewall with you, go ashore, and inquire for a black cooper by the
name of Pierre Lallemont, and ask him to come aboard, and put a head in
a water-cask, cooper some barrels, and bring the stock to do it with. I
want it done aboard.""

Walter gave Dick the measure of the head.

""That beats all my going to sea,"" said Dick, as they pulled ashore--""to
stave in the head of a good water-cask, cut the hoops of a new
beef-barrel, and then send ashore for a cooper to mend 'em, as high
wages as the coopers charge here.""

""It's none of our consarn. We don't find the water-casks or pay the
cooper.""

""I guess Lion Ben would think it was his consarn to let us have the
vessel for nothing, and then have water-casks stove up for the fun of
the thing. There must be something the matter with his head. I hope the
poor lad ain't got a sun-stroke. He was sitting there a long time in
the sun, talking with the bumboat-man.""

""I reckon his head is well enough,"" said Sewall. ""I wish mine had as
much in it.""

At noon the boat came back, and, in company, a shore boat, in which
was Pierre Lallemont, with his stock and tools, rowed by a negro
boy. He was quite a contrast to Solomon, being a strong, tall,
intelligent-looking man, pretty well bleached, and in the prime of
life. He went to work directly, with his boy, on the water-cask. When
the job was finished, Walter took him into the cabin alone, and, after
paying him, said to him in French, ""Did you do any work for Captain
Aldrich, of the Casco, when he was here?""

""Yes, sir; I coopered his molasses.""

""He lost his cook here, it is said.""

""So I heard at the time.""

""Old Quambo, the bumboat-man, told me you said he was kidnapped, and
sold to a planter.""

""He lies!"" replied Pierre, quickly. ""I never spoke a word to him about
any such thing.""

""He never said you did, but that he overheard you tell your wife that
man was sold to a planter.""

""He's an old fool, and lost what sense he ever had.""

""Will one hundred dollars in gold help your recollection?""

This offer made no impression upon the negro.

""Cooper, was you born of free parents, or was you ever a slave?""

""I never was a field-hand, cap'n. I was a slave, but kept about my
master, and learned to read, write, and cast accounts, and learned the
cooper's trade.""

""How did you get your freedom?""

""By working holidays, Sundays, and extra hours, often in the night.""

""I know you can tell me what became of that man, if you will. I see
it in your face. Now take the matter home to yourself. Suppose, after
you had worked hard, obtaining your liberty by many long years of hard
toil, and had gone on business to Guadaloupe, leaving wife and children
behind; there been seized, and sold into slavery; what would you think
of a person of your own color, who, having been a slave, and knowing
from experience how bitter that bondage was, would not contribute in so
small a degree towards your deliverance as to tell your friends, your
wife, your children, where you was. Pierre Lallemont, you are that man.""

""Is that all you want me to do, cap'n?""

""Yes, to give such information as may enable me to act.""

""If I aid you, and it is known, I am a dead man.""

""I don't want you to lift a finger, or commit yourself in any way. All
the information I ask you can give me on this spot, where there are no
witnesses except the God above us; and I never will breathe a word you
utter.""

""Put your questions, captain.""

""Did Aldrich sell Peterson to Henri Lemaire for two thousand dollars?""

""He did.""

""Is he alive?""

""He is.""

""Where?""

""On Lemaire's plantation.""

""Where is that?""

""On the north-eastern side, at Vauclin. He has plantations at the
northern part of the island; but this is his home place, where he
lives, and where he keeps the most slaves, and stores the greatest part
of his coffee till he sells it.""

""What does he put Peterson to doing?""

""Calking. He has so many drogers, there's work enough for him and
others all the time.""

""Does he treat him well?""

""Yes; feeds him well, and hires him holidays; does all he can to make
him contented, for fear he will get away, but locks him up every night.
Haven't you obtained information enough?""

""A few more questions. Does he often come to St. Pierre in his droger?""

""Once a fortnight.""

""Does he have any particular one for his own use?""

""Yes.""

""Is she any different from the rest?""

""She has a white streak, a red bead, and H. L. in her mainsail; the
others are all black.""

""Here is your money.""

""I didn't give you this information for money, cap'n. I've been a slave
to Henri Lemaire. If he should find out that any information had gone
from me, he would have me assassinated. I have put my life in your
hands.""

""You may trust in me. I am equally in your power. You can secure
yourself and destroy me at any moment by telling him my business here.
Have you any objection to inform me of another thing?""

""No, now that we have gone so far.""

""How came you by this knowledge?""

""His overseer told me.""

""He was a very powerful man; how did they take him?""

[Illustration: THE CAPTURE OF PETERSON.]

""He had to pass through a narrow alley on his way back to the vessel.
The overseer and four more stretched a wire across it; he couldn't see
the wire in the night, and fell over it. They leaped on him while he
was down, handcuffed, gagged him, and put him into a droger. It was
nothing uncommon to see Lemaire's overseer taking a runaway slave home,
and no one paid any attention to it.""

""When will he probably be here again?""

""To-day is Saturday; next Tuesday will be his day.""

Walter did not communicate his information to any one, not oven to Ned.
In the mean time, they were all very much puzzled to divine why he did
not get under way, if he was going from one plantation to another, and
not lose any more time.

Sunday night, without giving the source of his information, he told
them he had ascertained where Lemaire's plantation was; that he would
probably be at St. Pierre the next Tuesday, or thereabouts; and to look
sharp for a droger with a white waist, a red bead round her, and H. L.
in the middle cloth of her mainsail.

Tuesday afternoon, about three o'clock, Ned, whose curiosity had
led him to go to the mast-head, reported that there was a sail in
sight, which proved to be the droger they were expecting, followed at
different distances by several others, also belonging to Lemaire.

""Mr. Gates,"" said the captain, ""let us take the boat when he gets
along, and have a look at him.""

They put the sail in the boat, shipped the fancy rudder, which had not
been used since they left Pleasant Cove, and started just as the droger
came to anchor at a cable's length from the beach.

They were passing the droger, on their way to the beach, while her
negro crew were furling the sails. The planter, who was seated on deck,
smoking, hailed and invited them to come on board. They gladly accepted
an invitation which afforded a personal interview with the very man
they were so anxious to see.

Quite contrary to their expectations, they found Henri Lemaire, in
appearance at least, an affable, frank, pursy little Frenchman, of
about sixty years of age, and very neatly dressed. It was evidently
the boat that had attracted his attention; for the first question he
asked, after the usual salutations had been exchanged, was, ""Will you
sell that boat, captain?"" instantly adding, with a smile, ""Of course
you will. Your countrymen will sell anything; for it was in this very
harbor that one of your American captains sold all the masts he had for
a thousand dollars, and went home with a jury-mast.""

Walter did not tell the Frenchman that the captain who did that was one
of his schoolmates, but replied, ""This is all the boat I have, and she
answers my purpose well. I should be loath to part with her.""

""What are you loaded with, captain?""

""Frames for small houses, shingles, nails, locks and hinges, spermaceti
candles, and knickknacks.""

""How large are the frames?""

Walter gave him the dimensions.

""How many have you got?""

""Twenty-five, or thereabouts.""

""I think they would be what I should like to store different qualities
of coffee in, and for other purposes. I want a house for my overseer.
They are not large enough for that.""

""Put two of them together.""

""What do you ask for them?""

""I haven't fixed any price yet. I don't know as I shall sell here.""

""Do you think you can do better at Guadaloupe?""

""I didn't know but I should go up to the northern part of the island,
and call at the plantations. My vessel is light draught. I can run into
any of the coves and creeks, and barter with the planters.""

""What do you want for your lumber?""

""My vessel is small to take sugar or cotton; therefore prefer coffee,
indigo, cloves, or cocoa.""

""But that boat--of course you'll sell her; you are only holding off for
price.""

""Well, I don't know. You see yourself, if I go calling round into
the creeks, this boat is just what I want, and I could not get along
without it.""

Walter then invited him to get into her, and take a sail, which he did,
and they parted on the best of terms.




CHAPTER XV.

VAUCLIN.


If the crew of the Perseverance thought their young captain somewhat
dilatory, they soon had reason to modify that opinion, since he turned
them out at three o'clock the next morning to raft one of the frames
ashore, and raise it on the beach.

A large crowd of buyers came to look at it, and among the first
Lemaire. All were anxious to buy, not merely the frames, but the
hardware, some edge-tools that were in the vessel, and, in short, the
whole cargo; but Lemaire outbid the rest, and made a bargain with
Walter to go to his plantation at Vauclin, and there exchange his
frames and other cargo for coffee, indigo, tortoise-shell, and cloves,
at certain prices agreed upon between them. Walter, for the sake of
going to the spot where Peterson was, would have closed with the
planter at almost any price; but the rates now agreed upon left him a
very large profit. The frame on the beach was taken down, and put on
board of one of the drogers that had discharged her cargo of sugar, and
she immediately made sail for the plantation.

That night, when the crew of the Perseverance assembled in the
cuddy,--for, like all pink sterns, she had her accommodations forward,
and the salt-room aft,--Walter told them that in two days, during which
time Lemaire would get through with his business, they were to set
sail for his plantation. The announcement gave rise to a most animated
discussion as to the course to be pursued after they arrived there. It
was much nearer morning than midnight when they turned in.

French and Spanish vessels are all well modelled, and, in general, sail
well. The West India drogers, being constantly obliged to work out
in creeks and coves, and contend with head winds, are generally fast
vessels; but although, during the war of Independence, the Americans
had been brought by necessity to build sharp vessels to prey upon
British commerce, and escape from their men-of-war, the great majority
of the American vessels employed in the West India trade were of the
old English model, built after the fashion of the colonial period.
Beauty and speed were sacrificed to capacity, and the vessel that could
carry the most lumber and molasses, with the least tonnage on the
custom-house books, was considered the best, since in that trade, at
that period, capacity was more profitable than speed. But the inventive
genius of the people, always equal to the situation, was manifested in
their fishermen. In respect to this class of vessels, always on a lee
shore, and navigating among shoals and breakers, where both life and
property depended upon their weatherly qualities, speed paid. Thus it
came to pass that occasionally, in the winter, after the fishing season
was over, an Ipswich chebacco boat or Marblehead pink-stern would
take a cargo of onions, codfish, or small lumber, and go to the West
Indies, when those who confounded her with the common lumber drogers,
and supposed they could sail two feet to her one, caught a Tartar. It
was so in the present instance. Lemaire prided himself upon the sailing
qualities of his droger, and thought nothing on the coast could hold
way with her.

He came alongside of the Perseverance, the morning of the day
appointed, and said,--

""Captain, I shall be ready in about two hours. I must go ashore again.
You had better get your anchor and make sail.""

""But I don't know the way.""

""No matter; you can be jogging along the coast. I'll overtake you, and
then you can follow me.""

""Very well,"" was the reply.

It was a good working breeze, the wind for a portion of the way nearly
ahead--a direction well adapted to show the weatherly qualities of a
vessel.

""Make sail,"" said Walter; ""we'll be _jogging_.""

With only her fore, mainsail, and jibs set, the Perseverance soon left
the harbor astern. Hour after hour passed, and nothing was seen of
Lemaire; but as they knew the general direction, and that there were no
reefs or shoals, they kept on till they made Diamond Rock, on the port
hand, when they must round the southern extremity of the island, and
a pilot was needed. They accordingly hove to abreast of this singular
rock, rising perpendicularly between five and six hundred feet above
the sea, except on the western side, which is accessible, and where are
a few small trees and bushes.

Lemaire was astonished, when, after getting his anchor, he looked in
vain for the Yankee schooner, and knew not what to make of it, as she
was hidden from his view by the island. After waiting till the droger
came up, and passed ahead for nearly a mile, they put the bonnet on
the jib, set the gaff-topsails, came up with and passed her, as Dick
Cameron said, ""hand over fist,"" then hove to, and waited for her to
come up.

""I guess,"" said Walter, ""we can spare him the gaff-topsails, the bonnet
off the jib, and the flying-jib, and then keep jogging.""

Having thus shortened sail, they fell into the wake of the droger.

Lemaire was excessively annoyed at being beaten so outrageously by a
lumber carrier, and internally resolved to buy the American schooner,
as he had not the least doubt but a Yankee would sell anything, only
give him his price; and if she would sail like that loaded, what
wouldn't she do in a set of pig-iron ballast, and with copper on her
bottom!

Rounding Cape Ferre, they entered the Passe Vauclin, where the
navigation was most intricate. Sewall Lancaster was one of those who
seem by nature constituted for pilots. If he went to a place once, he
could go again. In the woods, or on the water, Sewall could find his
way. Though an uncouth, awkward being, caring little whom he pleased
or displeased, he was a good navigator, had been mate several voyages,
and only went before the mast in the brigantine because of the profits,
and volunteered to go in the Perseverance because he was a relative of
Walter, and greatly attached to Captain Rhines. When Walter saw the
nature of the navigation, he said,--

""Sewall, I must calculate on you to bring us out again; this is a
crooked place.""

""Never fear, cap'n; I'll take my landmarks, crooked as it is.""

The plantation of Lemaire was of great extent, comprising two coves,
separated by a point of moderate height, rocky at its extremity. The
cove on the southern side being appropriated to the house and offices
connected with it, and the northerly one, where was a greater depth
of water, was the site of the mill, the house of the overseer, negro
quarters, hospital, and other buildings. Here were a wharf, and
facilities for repairing vessels, work-shop, and so on, and here the
drogers were moored. The great wealth of this planter was evident from
the character of the buildings, which were to a great extent of stone
or timber, and the roofs covered with tiles, instead of thatch and
palm-leaf, as is generally the case. Many of the work-shops were built
of timber framed together, the walls covered with narrow pine boards
lapped one over the other to shed rain, and the roofs either tiled
or shingled after the fashion in America--constant intercourse with
the States having taught the French planters many of the methods of
building in use there; and, as in that climate timber decayed rapidly,
there was a steady demand for lumber.

As they slowly entered the harbor, the sound of hammers, axes, and
calking mallets was heard from the northern cove. With eager curiosity
the boys strove to make out the form of Peterson among some negroes
driving oakum into the gar-board seams of a droger that lay aground
upon the beach.

""There is no man there large enough for him,"" said Walter.

The schooner dropped her anchor in the cove, and the ship's company
had the rest of the day--it being two hours before night--at their own
disposal, as nothing could be done towards discharging till the negroes
moved some sugar that occupied the wharf.

After supper they went ashore, and took a stroll over the plantation,
hoping they might get some inkling of Peterson, but without making any
inquiries, or manifesting any undue curiosity to excite suspicion, for
all felt that they were treading on dangerous ground. They went among
slaves employed in all sorts of work, calkers, coopers, carpenters, not
daring to inquire, and, without obtaining any information, returned on
board.

""Where do you suppose he can be?"" said Ned. ""We've looked everywhere.""

""Perhaps they've carried him to some of his other plantations,"" said
Lancaster.

""No, he's here,"" said Walter.

""Where is he, then?""

""Locked up. That was what that droger was sent off in such a hurry
for,--that we put the frame aboard of, that was on the beach,--to tell
the overseer that an American vessel was coming into the creek. Lemaire
is not such a fool as not to know that a fellow as smart as Peterson
would do his best to get aboard of her. He will probably be kept out of
sight as long as we are here, and we must find where he's confined, and
get at him.""

""What puzzles me,"" said Dick, ""is why so smart a nigger as you say he
is hasn't got away before, and got aboard some vessel.""

""That is what puzzles me, too,"" said Walter.

""What kind of a vessel do you call that, captain?"" said the planter,
when he came down in the morning.

""We call them pink-sterns.""

""Why don't you build larger vessels of the same model?""

""They would draw too much water, and would not carry enough.""

""What are they made for?""

""Fishing. They will carry all the fish necessary, and are excellent
sea-boats.""

""She sails like the wind. Will you sell her?""

""She doesn't belong to me.""

""Your captains are always allowed discretionary powers. Your owners
would not object to a round price.""

""She is owned by one man, who would not part with her, as she once
belonged to a dear friend of his.""

Every effort was made by Walter and his crew, by prowling round in the
night, to discover the place of Peterson's confinement.

They cultivated the acquaintance of the negroes, who for their long
residence on the estate, and supposed devotion to their master's
interests, were promoted to the office of night watchmen, in hopes
something might drop from them to throw light on the matter, while, at
the same time, they dared not commit themselves by inquiry. The captain
also became more and more intimate with Lemaire and the overseer, but
all to no purpose, till at length the matter grew serious. The vessel
was discharged, would soon begin to load, and there would be no longer
any excuse for remaining.

One night, as Walter lay feverish and wakeful in his berth, his
mechanical turn furnished him with an excuse for prolonging his stay.

""Monsieur,"" said he the next day to Lemaire, ""I thought you wanted a
new house for your overseer.""

""So I do; but these frames are not large enough.""

""Put three of them together, one on top of the other, and the third for
a porch.""

""That would be a great deal of work.""

""I'll do it for you with my crew, if you will find us, and pay us
moderate wages, cover the outside, lay the floors, and shingle the
roofs.""

To this the planter agreed, and forthwith all hands went to work, but
in a manner very much resembling that of the negroes, as they desired
to prolong the time.

For some time the attention of Walter had been attracted by a stone
building of moderate size, of which no use seemed to be made as a
storehouse, the windows of which were some feet from the ground and
grated. He noticed a negro, a body servant of the planter, go in there
about meal times with something in a basket, and thought it must be the
place where Peterson was confined.

Access was difficult, even to the outside, in the night, as a negro
called Jean Baptiste, and in whom great confidence was placed, kept the
night watch before it. Walter made the acquaintance of Jean, which was
not at all difficult, as the negro was delighted with the notice of
both him and Ned. Nothing, however, came of it for some days.

At length Walter, being at work with Ned on the frame of the overseer's
house, and thus brought above the level of the grates in the building
which had been so long the object of intense curiosity, thought, as he
looked towards it, he perceived something moving behind the grates,
although the distance was too great to determine its character.

But the very possibility that Peterson was confined there made Walter's
heart leap to his throat. He looked around. Below were Sewall, Dick,
and three negro assistants. He made a signal to Ned, and directed his
attention to the place, and received a nod of intelligence.

Every few moments that afternoon their eyes were fastened on those
grates. As the sun declined, the rays, falling on the apertures, made
them quite confident that they saw a human figure pacing back and
forth. It seemed to Walter and Ned as though the sun would never, never
set that night.

The moment they reached the vessel the announcement was made. Walter,
Ned, and Dick began to devise methods to ascertain whether their
suspicions were well founded.

""If you want to know, and can't see,"" said Lancaster, who stood
listening in silence, ""why don't you take the glass? That's what they
have 'em for.""

""What precious fools we are,"" said Walter, ""looking and longing all the
afternoon, and couldn't think of that!""

Within a short distance of the frame they had been at work upon, rose
the high ground, forming the point that separated the two coves. In
the evening, Walter hid the glass among some bushes on the side of the
ascent, and while the rest were at breakfast the next morning, he and
Ned repaired to the spot.

Walter put the glass to his eye, and was rewarded by seeing the
well-known features of his black friend pressed against the grates.

""It's he,"" whispered Walter, trembling with suppressed delight, as
he passed the glass to Ned. The boys sat and looked at each other in
silent ecstasy, with hand clasped in hand for a few moments, and then,
creeping stealthily from the place, by a look and gesture conveyed the
intelligence to their shipmates as they joined them at the building.
How to establish communication with Peterson was the subject that
occupied the thoughts of Walter during the entire day.

Having made the habits of Jean a study for some time, he ascertained
that he, like most negroes, kept a very poor watch. An old log lay
beside the wall of the pig-yard, several rods from Peterson's window;
upon this the negro would often sit, lean his back against the wall,
and get sound asleep. During this time a good opportunity offered to
attract the attention of Peterson, and communicate with him; but as
it was not until late at night that Jean fell asleep, Peterson would
be asleep also, and it would be impossible to arouse him within those
thick walls without making noise enough to wake Jean likewise. They
therefore determined to do it in the daytime, as exposing them to the
least chance of detection, there being no watch kept then, the building
not situated in any common thoroughfare, and the risk of observation
from any transient passer very little. There is a great difference in
the treatment of slaves by different planters, some being of a cruel,
others of a more mild disposition, and disposed not to aggravate the
hardships of their slaves by savage treatment; and there are some
in whose hands the institution assumes somewhat of a patriarchal
character. Lemaire was one of this latter class; whether it sprang
from kindness of natural disposition or calculation, as thinking they
would last longer and accomplish more in the end, his slaves were well
fed, lightly worked, and seldom flogged. He kept a strict watch over
his overseers, and the negro drivers especially, and has been known,
when he heard the lash too frequently, to go to the spot, take the
whip from the negro driver, and giving him three or four severe cuts,
say, ""See how you like that yourself!"" The chief business of the day
was over at three o'clock; then came the dinner hour at the mansion,
after which Lemaire took his afternoon nap. The overseer did the same;
the negroes improved the opportunity to shirk and sleep, and while
work went on in the field and at the cane mill more leisurely, all was
repose in the vicinity of the dwelling.

The boys had succeeded so well in gaining the confidence of all on the
plantation, that they went everywhere without question, both night and
day, sat down and gossiped with the children and worn-out darkies who
were employed in picking over coffee and cloves, strolled into the
fields, and among the carpenters and calkers, at work upon the drogers,
for Lemaire built his own vessels.

This hour of napping was the time of the day selected by the boys as
most favorable for their purpose. It was a little after four in the
afternoon of the day succeeding that on which they had obtained a
glimpse of Peterson, when they strolled leisurely towards the lock-up
to reconnoitre.

A superannuated negro, partially blind and wholly deaf, sat half
asleep on the steps; a parcel of negro children were burrowing in
the sand beneath the walls of the adjoining stable, and teasing a
turkey-cock by holding up before him a tattered red handkerchief.

With these exceptions, no person was seen around the premises. ""We need
not fear that old negro, nor these little children,"" said Walter, ""and
we never shall have a better opportunity than at this very time.""

In the yard was a small building used for storing the coarse cloth
of which coffee-bags were made; a cart was tipped up against it, by
clambering on which it was not difficult to reach the roof.

""I will get up to the roof of that shed,"" said Ned, ""where I can see
all around, and make a signal if any one is coming.""

No sooner had Ned gained the roof of the shed, than Walter placed
himself directly beneath the grated window, at which they had seen
Peterson the morning previous. The blacks possess a wonderful ability
for singing those songs of labor used by both black and white seamen
to lighten their toil. Negroes in general possess a great facility for
remembering tunes, and even the words of songs. In the West Indies
you will hear negroes who cannot speak a word of English (to know what
it means), sing a song which they have caught from white sailors, all
through, without knowing the meaning of one word.

Peterson had a large stock of these songs, which he had picked up in
the course of his sea life from sailors of different nations, with whom
he had been shipmate. It had been a favorite recreation of Walter,
in years past, to sit on Peterson's knee, and coax him to sing those
songs, while the little fellow would clap his hands, join in the
chorus, and applaud most lustily at the close, always winding up with
an entreaty for just one more. Sometimes on a rainy Saturday afternoon,
when the weather prevented Peterson from working, half a dozen of the
boys would get round him, and, together with his own children, make the
old house ring with their screams, while Luce, Peterson's wife, would
take her hands out of the suds and join the merry company.

Walter stood some minutes leaning against the wall, striving to recall
some favorite song that had often served them upon those occasions. Al
length, suddenly exclaiming, ""I have it,"" he began in a low tone to
sing,--

    ""Where have you been all this day,
      Bonnie laddie, Highland laddie,
    From your hills so far away,
      My bonny Highland laddie?""

Instantly, in the same cautious tone, came through the grates the
succeeding stanza,--

    ""Donald's been to Aberdeen,
      Bonnie lassie, Highland lassie,
    To see de duke in his Highland green,
      My bonnie Highland lassie.""

""Peterson,"" said Walter.

""Here I is. Who is you?""

""Walter--Walter Griffin.""

""Bress de Lord! Who is wid you?""

""Little Ned, Sewall Lancaster, and Dick Cameron, your shipmate in the
Leonidas, and old Neptune as cook. We are here in the Perseverance, and
have come after you. Luce and the children, Captain Rhines, Lion Ben,
and all our folks are well.""

""Bress de Lord. He's too good; O, bress de Lord.""

""Here, Peterson, take this;"" and Walter took from his pocket a long
piece of tarred twine, with a nail at the end of it, and fastening the
string to a piece of rattan, thrust it through the grates.

""What dis for?""

""I dare not stay any longer now. When it is dark, tie this string round
your wrist, and drop the nail out of the window. I'll come here at
twelve o'clock to-night, when Jean is asleep, pull it to wake you up,
and then we can talk more, and lay our plans.""

At the appointed time Walter was on the spot. After telling Peterson
how they ascertained he was sold and where he was, he asked,--

""Could you get out of that window, if we take the bars out?""

""No, sonny; it no large enough.""

""Then we must break the door.""

""Dat make too much noise. You bring strong string, piece of spun-yarn,
and crowbar; tie de bar to de spun-yarn; I pull him up, hide him in
my bed; den, when time come, pull de staple out de stone what hold de
bolt. De stones of dis island bery soft, Peterson bery strong; pull him
out; make no noise.""

The plantation at Vauclin abounded in domestic animals and fowls of
all kinds. Hogs were not suffered to run at large, but were kept in
a yard surrounded by a high stone wall, laid in lime mortar; here
were hogs, sucking pigs, and shotes of all ages. The fowls run at
large. There were ducks, geese, guinea-fowl, turkeys, and hens in
abundance. These were all under the supervision of an old negro,
assisted by several boys. Philip was a Guinea negro, uncommonly stupid
and indolent, although his office was no sinecure, as the other slaves
stole all the fowls and pigs they could lay their hands on. But the
depredations of the negroes upon their master's poultry and pigs were
few indeed compared with those of Dick Cameron. From the time Dick was
ten years old, and held horses for a baubee in the streets of Greenock,
he had been flung upon his own resources, was an old forager, and
his miscellaneous life was not favorable to the cultivation of very
accurate distinctions in respect to the rights of individuals in such
things as fruit, fowl, and other outlying property.

Dick would have cut his right hand off sooner than have cheated his
landlord, backed out after signing the ship's articles, or run away
after taking his advance wages; but he would not hesitate an instant in
helping himself to a pair of trousers, or a frock, from any piece of
canvas that was lying about decks, or to any rope, small line, twine,
or worming he wanted for beckets to his chest, hammock lashings, or
strings to a clothes-bag. Entertaining such sentiments, it was not
wonderful that, since the arrival of the Perseverance, turkeys, ducks,
and guinea-fowl should disappear with astonishing rapidity, especially
turkeys. At length Walter objected to the process by which he had good
reason to suppose the table of the Perseverance was supplied; but all
the difference this made was, that, although he and Ned fared less
sumptuously, Sewall, Dick, and old Nep lived none the worse, taking
their meals at extra hours by themselves; and what they were unable to
consume there were plenty of invited guests to finish.

At length the disappearance of some very fine turkeys attracted the
attention of the cook, who told his master. He threatened to flog Phil
if the matter went on.

""It is these white sailors,"" said the planter. ""They steal them in the
night. There's never a vessel comes here but the fowl and pigs are
stolen. You must set a watch while this vessel is here,--there's enough
of you,--or shut them up.""

As the easiest method, Phil and his understrappers shut up the fowl;
but every night, when Phil drove them in, some of the turkeys were
missing.

""You lazy rascal,"" said Lemaire, ""can't you keep them from stealing
them in broad daylight? They don't take the geese; why don't you keep
them from taking the turkeys as well?""

""Wharra fur you flog poor nigga, massa? How I help it, massa? When
buckra man come, goose he say, 'Sailor man, sailor man.' Den Phil he
look sharp. Buckra man go 'way; no git him. Turkey he big fool; go
round all de day long, head one side, hollerin, 'Quit, quit, quit.'
Wharra poor nigga do? He no tell when sailor man dere, 'cause turkey
holler, 'Quit, quit,' all de time.""

A few days after this conversation with his master, Phil was asleep in
the sun, in the midst of his feathered charge, when he was aroused by
a great outcry among the turkeys. Rousing up, he heard all the turkeys
crying, ""Quit, quit,"" and saw Dick running for dear life, with the
gobbler after him, his neck outstretched, and his wings flapping.

""Yah, yah!"" he exclaimed, rubbing his eyes; ""wharra fur you run so,
buckra man? Turkey no bite you.""

[Illustration: ""WHARRA FUR YOU RUN SO, BUCKRA MAN? TURKEY NO BITE
YOU.""]

It is said ""a stern chase is a long chase."" It proved so in this
instance; for the gobbler never returned. The simple truth was, Dick
had baited a hook with corn, and was dragging the old gobbler after
him.

Ned was quite fond of going up and sitting among the negroes Sundays,
listening to their queer expressions, and watching the frolics of
the little darkies. One Sunday morning, there were many of them in a
large yard near the house, one part of which was a garden, separated
by an open fence of bamboo from the pig-yard. On the other side of the
pig-yard was a smaller place, set apart for hens with young chickens.

The children were playing in the dirt and among the hogs, the older
negroes sitting in the sun on a bench, in their holiday clothes,
chatting and laughing. In the yard was a sow, with twelve pigs almost
weaned. Ned sat next to Phil, who, as usual, was half asleep, and saw
a pollock-line, which was not far from the color of the wall, flung
over, attached to which was a hook, baited with a piece of bread. In
a few moments a great squealing drew the attention of all, and one of
the pigs was seen going right up the wall as fast as he could move his
legs, and in a moment disappeared over the summit.

""Je hay, buckra man!"" cried Phil, in amazement, and, turning to Ned,
said, ""Eighteen year dis nigga been in Martinique; nebber see pig run
ober dat wall 'fore dis morning.""

It may strike some of our young readers as rather singular, since we
have spoken of a garden, that vegetables should be salable in the West
Indies, where the soil and climate are so favorable to vegetation,
and even bring high prices, especially in Martinique, which is well
watered. One great reason of this, undoubtedly, was neglect, since
most of the garden vegetables are raised in Martinique now. It must be
recollected that many vegetables used on the table are not palatable
when grown in a hot climate. Peas ripen so fast that you can only have
them just for one picking. It is the same with corn, which, instead
of being a long time in the milk, as with us at the north, ripens as
it grows. Potatoes are not half as good as those of cold climates;
beets and carrots soon grow tough and stringy, running up to seed the
first year; cabbages won't form a close head, and are now exported by
tons to Cuba. Add to this, that so many fruits grow spontaneously, and
attention is all directed to sugar, coffee, and cotton.




CHAPTER XVI.

""O, MASSA, BUCKRA CALKER!""


The vessel was now nearly loaded. The boys began to consult with the
crew in regard to getting Peterson out of the prison, and aboard the
vessel. As there were quite a number of watchmen to pass besides
Jean, and who were rather more wakeful than that worthy, Dick advised
getting them drunk. Sewall favored that plan. Neptune, on the other
hand, proposed taking the watchmen with them. He said every one of them
would go in a minute for the sake of getting their liberty. But neither
Walter nor Ned approved of either of these ways.

""I don't believe in getting persons drunk,"" said Walter; ""nor do I want
to steal his negroes.""

""Didn't he steal 'em?"" said Dick.

""No; he bought 'em.""

""Wal,"" said Sewall, ""he bought 'em of those that did steal 'em; and
the receiver is as bad as the thief.""

""Well, I won't do that,"" was the reply.

In a few days there would be a double-cross holiday, when the negroes
would be frolicking and dancing night and day. It was, therefore,
resolved to make the attempt the night after the frolic, when the
negroes, being completely tired out, would be sure to sleep soundly on
their posts.

Lemaire was notified of the time of sailing, and requested to furnish a
pilot to take the vessel out of the creek. Meanwhile, Sewall Lancaster,
under pretence of fishing, had sounded the passe, and made himself
familiar with the channel; and the vessel was towed out some distance
from the wharf, to a place where she was hidden from view by a sharp
turn of the creek around a wooded point, and lay at a single anchor.

Walter sold the boat to Lemaire for one hundred and fifteen dollars and
another boat, that, for a vessel's use, was worth more than the one he
sold, being longer, stronger, and more burdensome, though clumsy and
homely. Having ascertained when the vessel was going, the planter said
to his overseer,--

""The schooner is going two days after the holiday. They have made a
great deal of the servants, and perhaps may take off some of them, or
some may stow themselves away. You must keep a good watch the last
night they are here.""

""The watchmen,"" said the overseer, ""will all be sleepy after the
holiday. I will keep watch with my son. They might take some fowl or
pigs, if nothing else. They've got an old sailor on board that would
steal a man's boots off his feet while he slept.""

This arrangement would have interfered most seriously with the designs
of the boys, as it was their intention to sail the night before the
appointed time, and would probably have frustrated the entire plan.
But, the day before the holiday, a planter from Sans-Souci rode over to
Vauclin. He had seen the frames, and wanted to make arrangements with
Walter to bring him some of the same dimensions, and also frames for a
house, sugar mill, and out-buildings, inviting Walter so cordially to
come over to his plantation the next morning, offering to send a horse
and servant for him, that he consented. The next morning a servant came
on horseback, and leading another horse for Walter, who told the crew
that he should be back in the evening to start. Walter dearly loved
to ride on horseback. Edmund Griffin, his father, owned a vast deal
of land, and raised a great many colts. The travelling in those days,
in that portion of the country where Walter was reared, being almost
exclusively on horseback, he had been early accustomed to horses. Many
a spanking gallop he had enjoyed, riding a half-broken colt to pasture,
bareback, without shoes or stockings, and clinging with his great toes
to the animal's sides, with no better bridle than a rope halter, and a
half hitch over the colt's nose.

With a splendid, well-bitted horse under him, riding through wild and
beautiful scenery, and amid a vegetation entirely new, he enjoyed the
most exquisite pleasure. Uneasy and perplexing thoughts would have
flung their sombre shadow over those pleasant scenes, and marred all
their beauty, had Walter been aware that the overseer and his son, both
strong, resolute men, armed to the teeth, were intending to share the
watch that night, and rouse any sleeping darkies by blows on the skull
from the butt of a pistol.

In blissful ignorance of impending danger, he surrendered himself
to the pleasures of the hour, and enjoyed a most delightful ride,
succeeded by a day of equal enjoyment at the hospitable mansion of the
planter.

Deliverance came, however, from a quarter whence it was least to be
expected, and thus the circumstance which threatened to render the
effort abortive, and involved a desperate conflict, proved the very
means of its success.

Old Nep had been invited by the negroes to share in the amusements
of the holiday, and, arrayed in white pants, waistcoat, and jacket,
proceeded to the great house to pay his respects to the ladies in the
kitchen. When he arrived old Phil was engaged in a wordy contest with
Juan Baptiste. It seems Phil had been whipped at last, for the loss of
so many turkeys and pigs, and Juan had been twitting him of it.

""You Guinea nigga youself,"" retorted Phil. ""Nobody sleep more'n
youself. Oberseer and Massa Peter gwine to hold watch to-night. You set
down on de log, go sleep, see what you git youself; yah, yah.""

""How you know dat?""

""Dinah hear massa say so--tell oberseer, kase Yankee vessel gwine
away.""

Nep, in great alarm, hastened back with the tidings, upon which
Dick Cameron instantly goes up to the house, pulls off his hat, and
tells Lemaire that the captain has gone to Sans-Souci, to be gone he
didn't know how many days, and the vessel wouldn't sail the next day;
therefore there was no need of the negro pilot.

After Dick had gone, Lemaire sent for the overseer,--who was a Spaniard
named Juan Romero,--and said to him,--

""The vessel is not going the day set. The captain's gone to Sans-Souci.
I'm sorry, for I want the calker to go to work on the new droger. It's
no use to set those stupid creatures to work on new work without him;
neither do I understand it. These Yankees make the most of their time,
and he seems as sharp as any of them. However, there it is; she won't
go, and you need not watch.""

""I can explain it,"" replied the overseer. ""Monsieur Renault has been
here, and wants to make a contract with him for timber. He has gone
over to see about it, what kind of a place it is to get to, and the
depth of water, because, if he brings large timber, he will need a
bigger vessel, and, as I understand it, he's to bring, not only
timber, but boards, shingles, nails, lattices, and all the materials
for the buildings.""

The next afternoon Renault sent Walter back to Vauclin by water,
arriving at the vessel about eight o'clock.

It was very important for them to set out at the earliest moment, in
order to place the greatest possible distance between themselves and
the island before daybreak. So, at ten o'clock in the evening, they
went ashore, scattered themselves among the different sentinels, and
found nearly all of them asleep. During the whole of the holiday, and
for most of the night, they had been engaged in frolicking, drinking,
and dancing fandango, had been kept at work during all the next day,
and were now so utterly exhausted that they dropped asleep the moment
they sat down, and were so overcome with drowsiness as to stagger as
they walked.

Walter and Ned went to the yard, where they found Juan fast asleep.
Walter gave a light tap on the door of the lock-up, when it was
instantly opened, and they entered. Peterson had drawn the staple.
The black grasped the hands of his young deliverers, and sobbed for
joy. They left immediately, closing the door silently after them,
and sought the beach, soon coming to a watchman fast asleep, with
Dick standing by, ready to throttle him if he stirred. They passed on
till they came to another, whom Lancaster was watching, in the same
situation. All were now safely passed but the last, whom they saw at a
distance, pacing along the beach.

""I'll take care of him,"" said Ned.

As they must cross his beat directly to reach the boat, the others lay
flat upon the ground, while Ned went whistling along.

""Who dere?"" cried the sentinel.

Ned, giving his name, walked directly up to him, and they entered into
conversation about the holiday. Ned, giving him a cigar, persuaded him
to sit down on an old boat and smoke.

The poor darky had drawn but a few whiffs, when he began to nod; for
nature was exhausted by the sports of the holiday, want of sleep, and
subsequent labor. He fell over upon Ned, who was sitting beside him,
and the cigar dropped from his lips. Ned put his arm round the negro,
and gently laid him at full length upon the boat. In a few moments he
was sound asleep, and Ned ran to join his companions.

At the boat they found Neptune, who, having had his share of the
holiday, was asleep on the thwarts.

Swiftly and silently they pulled for the schooner.

""O, you bressed ole craft,"" said Peterson, kissing the gunwale; ""you
ole friend, you is; many the good time Peterson had in you.""

It was now dead calm, and they were on board a loaded vessel. The
prospect was by no means encouraging, for they well knew that, when the
absence of Peterson and the departure of the schooner were discovered,
a vengeful pursuit would take place.

Peterson, who had been many years a slave on this same island in his
youth,--as many of our readers are aware,--and was well acquainted with
the peculiarities of the climate, encouraged his shipmates.

""Nebber fear, Massa Walter. If it be calm here under de land in de
night, if we get out five, six miles, den we take trabe wind; sea
breeze, he blow all de time; plenty wind; much you carry, too.""

They hove up the anchor. There were two sweeps on board the schooner.
Dick and Peterson manned one, Walter and Lancaster the other, while
Ned and Nep took the boat and towed ahead. Matters soon began to
assume a brighter complexion. Cameron and Peterson were men of vast
strength. Lancaster was also a very strong man, and Walter belonged to
a family renowned for strength and endurance. They had, while lying
at the plantation, taken the precaution to clean the vessel's bottom,
and, as they could procure no tallow there, gave her bottom a coat of
tar and brimstone, which rendered it smooth, and added greatly to her
sailing. They were also excited to the utmost by their previous good
fortune, dread of being overtaken, and losing their hard-earned prize.
Not a word was spoken. No sound was heard but that of the oars, the
deep breathing of the rowers, as they exerted themselves to the utmost,
and at times a slight patter, as the sweat dropping from nose and chin
struck the deck. But when they had cleared the pass, were in the open
sea, no signs of daybreak, and the lessening shore assured them they
were making good progress, their efforts, though unremitting, became
less severe. In the course of another hour they had made such progress
that the long silence was broken by Peterson.

""Nebber fear, Massa Walter,"" he said; ""keep you heart up; dey no ketch
us dis time; we soon come to de wind; land air so hot he kill de wind
in shore. I tell you, you'se hab wind enough.""

""Only give me wind,"" said Walter, ""I'll risk their catching us.""

""The wind has got to come off the water,"" said Dick; ""if we've got no
wind to flee, they've got none to follow; it's as broad as 'tis long.""

""I take it, Peterson,"" said Lancaster, ""that we are somewhat nearer to
the wind than it is from us to the land.""

""Sartin; we not near so fur to go to git de sea-breeze as we hab come.""

""What time in the morning,"" asked Walter, ""did they bring your
breakfast?""

""About eight o'clock.""

""They won't know that you are gone till Peter comes to bring your
breakfast. The vessel was hidden by the woods; except by mere chance
some one should happen to go up on the hill, or down the creek in a
boat, she could not be seen.""

The day now began to break, and by the increasing light they saw with
the glass the line of blue water ahead rolling before the wind, while
between them and it extended a space of calm surface as smooth as
glass. A joyous shout burst from the weary, anxious crew at the sight.

""Come aboard, Mr. Gates,"" said the captain; ""we'll tow no more.""

Ned went to one of the sweeps, while Nep busied himself in preparing
breakfast. The line that separated the broken water from the calm was
now quite near. Peterson, unable to contain himself longer, gave vent
to his emotions in a favorite negro song, to which the rest contributed
a rousing chorus.

    ""My name is Johnny Jump-roun',
      And ebery person knock down.

        _Chorus._ Ho, ho, high-land-a,
                Roun' de corner Sally.

    ""My breast is made ob steel-plate,
      My arms dey made ob crow-bars.

        _Chorus._ Ho, ho, &c.

    ""And if you don't beliebe me,
      I gib you leabe to try me.

        _Chorus._ Ho, ho,"" &c.

Under this new impulse the vessel went through the water faster than
ever before, when the song was interrupted by the order, ""Make sail.""

""Gib dis chile room, 'cordin to his streff,"" shouted Peterson, flinging
the great sweep on board with a jerk, as though it had been the oar
of a yawl boat, and springing for the main throat-halyards. Nothing
now was heard but the creaking of pulley-blocks and the rattle of the
jib-hanks, as sail after sail went rapidly aloft. The Perseverance
had now lost the headway given by the oars, and lay motionless upon
the glassy surface of the ocean, her canvas hanging in idle folds;
but as the sun came up, the line of dark-blue water ahead came nearer
and nearer, little dimples flecked the smooth surface, a light cool
air fanned the cheeks of the expectant crew, the sails gave a slight
flutter, then slap came a heavy puff, the sheets strained and surged,
the lee rail was in the water; Lancaster sprang to the helm, and put
it hard up; the gallant craft shot ahead, the sunbeams glancing on her
sails, and the white foam flashing under her forefoot.

""Glory to God!"" shouted Peterson.

""O, Wal, we've done it,"" cried Ned; and utterly oblivious of the
distinctions of office, which he had heretofore so carefully observed,
flung his arms round Walter's neck.

""Shipmates,"" said Walter, as he returned the embrace, ""I have been for
more than two years trying to do my duty and pray to my Maker; but
though I have had courage for everything else, I have not had for that.
Let us thank God for bringing us safely through.""

Lancaster bent over the tiller, the rest, even to old Dick, knelt on
the deck, while in a few broken words Walter gave vent to his emotions,
and expressed the common sentiment. Charlie Bell's words had borne
fruit, but not by the light of the moon or beneath the stars in some
lone midnight watch, but in the bright glow of the morning sunbeams. In
the midst of his crew, while his brow was moistened with sweat, and his
hand outstretched to deliver the oppressed, the blessing of Him whose
ways are not our ways came.

Lemaire was at breakfast, when, with eyes starting from their sockets,
Peter entered the dining-hall (followed by Juan, old Phil, and all the
house servants), exclaiming, ""O, massa, de buckra calker no dere; he
gwine away.""

""Gone!"" cried Lemaire, leaping from his chair.

""Yes, massa. I go wid de breakfast, de door open, buckra man no dere.""

The negroes gave Peterson the name of buckra calker to distinguish him,
and on account of his superiority, although there was not a blacker
negro on the estate.

Without another word Lemaire ran to a cupola on the house-top, which
commanded a view of the sea. The schooner was nowhere to be seen; not a
sail was visible in the offing.




CHAPTER XVII.

DELIVERED.


Notwithstanding the Perseverance might bring a cargo that must be
discharged in Boston or Salem, it was considered a settled fact by all
at home, that she would, when arriving on the coast, steer first for
Pleasant Cove, and Captain Rhines was expecting her daily. The interest
felt there in respect to her coming was not a little increased by the
return of Ben (Peterson's oldest son) in the Casco.

Ben brought home considerable money, having been fortunate in a
""venture."" The first thing he did was to clothe his mother and the
three youngest boys, one eleven, one thirteen, and the oldest fifteen;
the next, to clapboard the house which, Peterson having lately built
it, was still unfinished. While Ben's hands were busy driving the
nails, his thoughts were on the stretch respecting the best place from
which to watch for the arrival of the Perseverance. He well knew there
was no place to compare, in that respect, with the big maple on the
heights of Elm Island. To Elm Island he hurried (when he had driven the
last nail), and repaired the platform in the top of the tree and the
ladder leading to it, both having become somewhat decayed since the
boy-days of John Rhines and Charlie Bell. He erected a signal staff on
the point of the island, from which to display a white cloth to give
notice to the people on the main land when the vessel hove in sight.
For the first few days he flattered himself that every vessel sighted
was the one so anxiously sought; but there were many fore-and-afters,
at that season of the year, making their way to the Bay of Chaleur,
Labrador, the Penobscot, or bound from the eastern ports and Nova
Scotia, to the westward. At last the poor boy, becoming quite
discouraged, said to Lion Ben at the supper table,--

""I believe I shall go home. If I was there I might be earning
something. I am spending time to no purpose, and shall wear out my
welcome.""

""Don't go, Ben,"" replied Sally; ""we love to have you here.""

""Don't go,"" said the Lion; ""I'll hire you to hoe corn, and then you
can earn something, and watch for the vessel, too.""

Two mornings after this conversation Ben was in the tree just as the
day was breaking, in order that he might make his observations before
it was time to go to hoeing. There were plenty of schooners, but none
of them _the schooner_. At length he espied one that seemed to be
steering in a different direction from the rest.

Long and patiently he watched her progress.

""She is heading directly up the bay; a pink-stern I guess, and about
the right size. It ain't her, after all,"" he exclaimed; ""this vessel is
rigged different; and yet how much she looks like her!""

At this he caught sight of Lion Ben, who was turning the cows into the
pasture.

""Mr. Rhines,"" he cried, ""I wish you would come up here. A pink is
coming up the bay, steering straight for Uncle Isaac's Cove. She hasn't
varied a pint this hour and a half. I could swear it was the schooner,
only she's rigged differently.""

""How is this one rigged?""

""She's got two jibs and two gaff-topsails.""

""So has the Perseverance.""

Peterson was not aware of the change that had been made in her rig, it
having been done while he was at sea.

The moment Lion Ben put the glass to his eye he said, ""It's her.""

Old and young were now flocking to every place commanding a good view
of the water. Half way between Elm Island and the main was a whale-boat
containing Ben Peterson, Lion Ben, and all his family, the Lion pulling
two oars, and Peterson one. Doubts now began to be freely expressed by
some of the least sanguine, and indignantly scouted by others.

""That's the vessel, to be sure,"" said Joe Bradish, always a prophet of
ill omen; ""but no knowing as Peterson's in her. He might be dead when
they got there, or that planter might have sold him to another planter
on some other island, or they might not be able to get him.""

""Just shut up your clam-shell--will you? You're always an off-ox,""
said Joe Griffin, seeing poor Luce tremble and the tears rundown
her cheeks,--as she stood holding the two youngest children by the
hand,--at the words of Bradish. ""She's deep-loaded; that, to my mind,
shows for itself that they've sold their cargo and had good luck; don't
it captain?"" turning to Captain Rhines.

""I think it does, Joseph. Cheer up, my girl,"" to Luce, ""and hope for
the best.""

But, to the disappointment of all, the wind, that had been moderating
for some time, died away to a flat calm, the tide turned, and the
vessel so anxiously expected was obliged to anchor.

""Neighbors,"" said Lion Ben, ""what say you for towing her up?""

""That's the talk, Ben,"" said Joe Griffin.

""Boats and boys!"" shouted Joel Ricker.

""Hurrah for a tow!"" echoed the crowd.

Thanks to Charlie Bell, whale-boats were plenty enough now.

""Father,"" said Ben, ""you shall be fleet commodore.""

It was but a short time before twelve boats and fifty men were ready.
Joe Bradish was getting into Joe Griffin's boat.

""You shan't go, you small concern,"" said Joe, and pitched him head
foremost into the water.

""Jonah's overboard--we shall have good luck, now.""

""I'll hoist the flag, neighbors,"" said the captain, as they were
shoving off, ""if they've got him.""

""If you want to get Peterson home,"" said Dick Cameron, ""take the boat
and pull up. I'll keep ship.""

""No need of that,"" said Walter, ""for here comes the whole neighborhood.""

""I seed him! I seed dad!"" screamed little Ike, who was nestled close to
the side of Captain Rhines.

""So do I see his old black face,"" said the captain, standing up. He
waved his hat, when a cheer arose from the fleet of boats astern. Like
bees they swarmed aboard the schooner, completely covering her deck,
while Peterson embraced his two boys, and clasped the hands of his
neighbors.

""They've got him, Luce; there goes the flag,"" cried Will Griffin; ""I
can see it plain with the glass; they are stringing out the boats.""

After a while,--

""Here she comes! Beeswax, don't she come!""

And well she might, with fifty of the strongest men in the town towing
her, three to each of her own sweeps, and Lion Ben to lead.

A shout arose from the crowd that made the shores ring as the sweeps
were shipped aboard the schooner, and Peterson, walking out on the
bowsprit, waved his hand to his friends.

Tears of joyous sympathy moistened many a cheek when Luce flung herself
into her husband's arms, while the little ones clasped his legs.

       *       *       *       *       *

Walter and Ned have now become accustomed to hardship, had experience
of danger, and incurred responsibility. The next volume of the series,
the Cruise of the Casco, will exhibit their capabilities when thrown
more entirely upon their own resources, and placed in trust of a large
interest under circumstances of deadly peril.

                           AN UNFINISHED COMEDY


The scene is a Surrey garden in early summer.  The paths are shaded by
tall box-wood hedges.  The--time is some sixty years ago.


                                 SCENE I

              PROFESSOR SPIRAL, DAME DRESDEN, LADY OLDLACE,
                  VIRGINIA, WINIFRED, SWITHIN, and OSIER

(As they slowly promenade the garden, the professor is delivering one of
his exquisite orations on Woman.)

SPIRAL:  One husband!  The woman consenting to marriage takes but one.
For her there is no widowhood.  That punctuation of the sentence called
death is not the end of the chapter for her.  It is the brilliant proof
of her having a soul.  So she exalts her sex.  Above the wrangle and
clamour of the passions she is a fixed star.  After once recording her
obedience to the laws of our common nature--that is to say, by descending
once to wedlock--she passes on in sovereign disengagement--a dedicated
widow.

     (By this time they have disappeared from view.  HOMEWARE appears;
     he craftily avoids joining their party, like one who is unworthy of
     such noble oratory.  He desires privacy and a book, but is disturbed
     by the arrival of ARDEN, who is painfully anxious to be polite to
     'her uncle Homeware.')



                                 SCENE II

                             HOMEWARE, ARDEN

ARDEN:  A glorious morning, sir.

HOMEWARE:  The sun is out, sir.

ARDEN:  I am happy in meeting you, Mr. Homeware.

HOMEWARE:  I can direct you to the ladies, Mr. Arden.  You will find them
up yonder avenue.

ARDEN:  They are listening, I believe, to an oration from the mouth of
Professor Spiral.

HOMEWARE:  On an Alpine flower which has descended to flourish on English
soil.  Professor Spiral calls it Nature's 'dedicated widow.'

ARDEN: 'Dedicated widow'?

HOMEWARE:  The reference you will observe is to my niece Astraea.

ARDEN:  She is dedicated to whom?

HOMEWARE:  To her dead husband!  You see the reverse of Astraea, says the
professor, in those world-infamous widows who marry again.

ARDEN:  Bah!

HOMEWARE:  Astraea, it is decided, must remain solitary, virgin cold,
like the little Alpine flower.  Professor Spiral has his theme.

ARDEN:  He will make much of it.  May I venture to say that I prefer my
present company?

HOMEWARE:  It is a singular choice.  I can supply you with no weapons for
the sort of stride in which young men are usually engaged.  You belong to
the camp you are avoiding.

ARDEN:  Achilles was not the worse warrior, sir, for his probation in
petticoats.

HOMEWARE:  His deeds proclaim it.  But Alexander was the better chieftain
until he drank with Lais.

ARDEN:  No, I do not plead guilty to Bacchus.

HOMEWARE:  You are confessing to the madder form of drunkenness.

ARDEN:  How, sir, I beg?

HOMEWARE:  How, when a young man sees the index to himself in everything
spoken!

ARDEN:  That might have the look.  I did rightly in coming to you, sir.

HOMEWARE: 'Her uncle Homeware'?

ARDEN:  You read through us all, sir.

HOMEWARE:  It may interest you to learn that you are the third of the
gentlemen commissioned to consult the lady's uncle Homeware.

ARDEN:  The third.

HOMEWARE:  Yes, she is pursued.  It could hardly be otherwise.  Her
attractions are acknowledged, and the house is not a convent.  Yet, Mr.
Arden, I must remind you that all of you are upon an enterprise held to
be profane by the laws of this region.  Can you again forget that Astraea
is a widow?

ARDEN:  She was a wife two months; she has been a widow two years.

HOMEWARE:  The widow of the great and venerable Professor Towers is not
to measure her widowhood by years.  His, from the altar to the tomb.  As
it might be read, a one day's walk!

ARDEN:  Is she, in the pride of her youth, to be sacrificed to a
whimsical feminine delicacy?

HOMEWARE:  You have argued it with her?

ARDEN:  I have presumed.

HOMEWARE:  And still she refused her hand!

ARDEN:  She commended me to you, sir.  She has a sound judgement of
persons.

HOMEWARE:  I should put it that she passes the Commissioners of Lunacy,
on the ground of her being a humorous damsel.  Your predecessors had also
argued it with her; and they, too, discovered their enemy in a whimsical
feminine delicacy.  Where is the difference between you?  Evidently she
cannot perceive it, and I have to seek: You will have had many
conversations with Astraea?

ARDEN:  I can say, that I am thrice the man I was before I had them.

HOMEWARE:  You have gained in manhood from conversations with a widow in
her twenty-second year; and you want more of her.

ARDEN:  As much as I want more wisdom.

HOMEWARE:  You would call her your Muse?

ARDEN:  So prosaic a creature as I would not dare to call her that.

HOMEWARE:  You have the timely mantle of modesty, Mr. Arden.  She has
prepared you for some of the tests with her uncle Homeware.

ARDEN:  She warned me to be myself, without a spice of affectation.

HOMEWARE:  No harder task could be set a young man in modern days.  Oh,
the humorous damsel.  You sketch me the dimple at her mouth.

ARDEN:  Frankly, sir, I wish you to know me better; and I think I can
bear inspection.  Astraea sent me to hear the reasons why she refuses me
a hearing.

HOMEWARE:  Her reason, I repeat, is this; to her idea, a second wedlock
is unholy.  Further, it passes me to explain.  The young lady lands us
where we were at the beginning; such must have been her humorous
intention.

ARDEN:  What can I do?

HOMEWARE:  Love and war have been compared.  Both require strategy and
tactics, according to my recollection of the campaign.

ARDEN:  I will take to heart what you say, sir.

HOMEWARE:  Take it to head.  There must be occasional descent of lovers'
heads from the clouds.  And Professor Spiral,--But here we have a belated
breeze of skirts.

     (The reference is to the arrival of LYRA, breathless.)



                                SCENE III

                          HOMEWARE, ARDEN, LYRA


LYRA:  My own dear uncle Homeware!

HOMEWARE:  But where is Pluriel?

LYRA:  Where is a woman's husband when she is away from him?

HOMEWARE:  In Purgatory, by the proper reckoning.  But hurry up the
avenue, or you will be late for Professor Spiral's address.

LYRA:  I know it all without hearing.  Their Spiral!  Ah, Mr. Arden!  You
have not chosen badly.  The greater my experience, the more do I value my
uncle Homeware's company.

     (She is affectionate to excess but has a roguish eye withal, as of
     one who knows that uncle Homeware suspects all young men and most
     young women.)

HOMEWARE:  Agree with the lady promptly, my friend.

ARDEN:  I would gladly boast of so lengthened an experience, Lady
Pluriel.

LYRA:  I must have a talk with Astraea, my dear uncle.  Her letters breed
suspicions.  She writes feverishly.  The last one hints at service on the
West Coast of Africa.

HOMEWARE:  For the draining of a pestiferous land, or an enlightenment of
the benighted black, we could not despatch a missionary more effective
than the handsomest widow in Great Britain.

LYRA:  Have you not seen signs of disturbance?

HOMEWARE:  A great oration may be a sedative.


LYRA:  I have my suspicions.

HOMEWARE:  Mr. Arden, I could counsel you to throw yourself at Lady
Pluriel's feet, and institute her as your confessional priest.

ARDEN:  Madam, I am at your feet.  I am devoted to the lady.

LYRA:  Devoted.  There cannot be an objection.  It signifies that a man
asks for nothing in return!

HOMEWARE:  Have a thought upon your words with this lady, Mr. Arden!

ARDEN:  Devoted, I said.  I am.  I would give my life for her.

LYRA:  Expecting it to be taken to-morrow or next day?  Accept my
encomiums.  A male devotee is within an inch of a miracle.  Women had
been looking for this model for ages, uncle.

HOMEWARE:  You are the model, Mr Arden!

LYRA:  Can you have intended to say that it is in view of marriage you
are devoted to the widow of Professor Towers?

ARDEN:  My one view.

LYRA:  It is a star you are beseeching to descend.

ARDEN: It is.

LYRA:  You disappoint me hugely.  You are of the ordinary tribe after
all; and your devotion craves an enormous exchange, infinitely surpassing
the amount you bestow.

ARDEN:  It does.  She is rich in gifts; I am poor.  But I give all I
have.

LYRA:  These lovers, uncle Homeware!

HOMEWARE:  A honey-bag is hung up and we have them about us.  They would
persuade us that the chief business of the world is a march to the altar.

ARDEN:  With the right partner, if the business of the world is to be
better done.

LYRA:  Which right partner has been chosen on her part, by a veiled
woman, who marches back from the altar to discover that she has chained
herself to the skeleton of an idea, or is in charge of that devouring
tyrant, an uxorious husband.  Is Mr. Arden in favour with the Dame,
uncle?

HOMEWARE:  My sister is an unsuspicious potentate, as you know.
Pretenders to the hand of an inviolate widow bite like waves at a rock.

LYRA:  Professor Spiral advances rapidly.

HOMEWARE:  Not, it would appear, when he has his audience of ladies and
their satellites.

LYRA:  I am sure I hear a spring-tide of enthusiasm coming.

ARDEN:  I will see.

     (He goes up the path.)

LYRA:  Now! my own dear uncle, save me from Pluriel.  I have given him
the slip in sheer desperation; but the man is at his shrewdest when he is
left to guess at my heels.  Tell him I am anywhere but here.  Tell him I
ran away to get a sense of freshness in seeing him again.  Let me have
one day of liberty, or, upon my word, I shall do deeds; I shall console
young Arden: I shall fly to Paris and set my cap at presidents and
foreign princes.  Anything rather than be eaten up every minute, as I am.
May no woman of my acquaintance marry a man of twenty years her senior!
She marries a gigantic limpet.  At that period of his life a man becomes
too voraciously constant.

HOMEWARE:  Cupid clipped of wing is a destructive parasite.

LYRA:  I am in dead earnest, uncle, and I will have a respite, or else
let decorum beware!

     (Arden returns.)

ARDEN:  The ladies are on their way.

LYRA:  I must get Astraea to myself.

HOMEWARE:  My library is a virgin fortress, Mr. Arden.  Its gates are
open to you on other topics than the coupling of inebriates.

     (He enters the house--LYRA disappears in the garden--Spiral's
     audience reappear without him.)



                                 SCENE IV

             DAME DRESDEN, LADY OLDLACE, VIRGINIA, WINIFRED,
                          ARDEN, SWITHIN, OSIER


LADY OLDLACE:  Such perfect rhythm!

WINIFRED:  Such oratory!

LADY OLDLACE:  A master hand.  I was in a trance from the first sentence
to the impressive close.

OSIER:  Such oratory is a whole orchestral symphony.

VIRGINIA:  Such command of intonation and subject!

SWITHIN:  That resonant voice!

LADY OLDLACE:  Swithin, his flow of eloquence!  He launched forth!

SWITHIN:  Like an eagle from a cliff.

OSIER:  The measure of the words was like a beat of wings.

SWITHIN:  He makes poets of us.

DAME DRESDEN:  Spiral achieved his pinnacle to-day!

VIRGINIA:  How treacherous is our memory when we have most the longing to
recall great sayings!

OSIER:  True, I conceive that my notes will be precious.

WINIFRED:  You could take notes!

LADY OLDLACE:  It seems a device for missing the quintessential.

SWITHIN:  Scraps of the body to the loss of the soul of it.  We can allow
that our friend performed good menial service.

WINIFRED:  I could not have done the thing.

SWITHIN:  In truth; it does remind one of the mess of pottage.

LADY OLDLACE:  One hardly felt one breathed.

VIRGINIA:  I confess it moved me to tears.

SWITHIN:  There is a pathos for us in the display of perfection.  Such
subtle contrast with our individual poverty affects us.

WINIFRED:  Surely there were passages of a distinct and most exquisite
pathos.

LADY OLDLACE:  As in all great oratory!  The key of it is the pathos.

VIRGINIA:  In great oratory, great poetry, great fiction; you try it by
the pathos.  All our critics agree in stipulating for the pathos.  My
tears were no feminine weakness, I could not be a discordant instrument.

SWITHIN:  I must make confession.  He played on me too.

OSIER:  We shall be sensible for long of that vibration from the touch of
a master hand.

ARDEN:  An accomplished player can make a toy-shop fiddle sound you a
Stradivarius.

DAME DRESDEN:  Have you a right to a remark, Mr. Arden?  What could have
detained you?

ARDEN:  Ah, Dame.  It may have been a warning that I am a discordant
instrument.  I do not readily vibrate.

DAME DRESDEN:  A discordant instrument is out of place in any civil
society.  You have lost what cannot be recovered.

ARDEN:  There are the notes.

OSIER:  Yes, the notes.

SWITHIN:  You can be satisfied with the dog's feast at the table, Mr.
Arden!

OSIER:  Ha!

VIRGINIA:  Never have I seen Astraea look sublimer in her beauty than
with her eyes uplifted to the impassioned speaker, reflecting every
variation of his tones.

ARDEN:  Astraea!

LADY OLDLACE:  She was entranced when he spoke of woman descending from
her ideal to the gross reality of man.

OSIER:  Yes, yes.  I have the words [reads]: 'Woman is to the front of
man, holding the vestal flower of a purer civilization.  I see,' he says.
'the little taper in her hands transparent round the light, against rough
winds.'

DAME DRESDEN:  And of Astraea herself, what were the words?  'Nature's
dedicated widow.'

SWITHIN:  Vestal widow, was it not?

VIRGINIA:  Maiden widow, I think.

DAME DRESDEN: We decide for 'dedicated.'

WINIFRED:  Spiral paid his most happy tribute to the memory of her late
husband, the renowned Professor Towers.

VIRGINIA:  But his look was at dear Astraea.

ARDEN:  At Astraea?  Why?

VIRGINIA:  For her sanction doubtless.

ARDEN:  Ha!

WINIFRED:  He said his pride would ever be in his being received as the
successor of Professor Towers.

ARDEN:  Successor!

SWITHIN:  Guardian was it not?

OSIER:  Tutor.  I think he said.

     (The three gentlemen consult Osier's notes uneasily.)

DAME DRESDEN:  Our professor must by this time have received in full
Astraea's congratulations, and Lyra is hearing from her what it is to be
too late.  You will join us at the luncheon table, if you do not feel
yourself a discordant instrument there, Mr. Arden?

ARDEN (going to her):  The allusion to knife and fork tunes my strings
instantly, Dame.

DAME DRESDEN:  You must help me to-day, for the professor will be tired,
though we dare not hint at it in his presence.  No reference, ladies, to
the great speech we have been privileged to hear; we have expressed our
appreciation and he could hardly bear it.

ARDEN:  Nothing is more distasteful to the orator!

VIRGINIA:  As with every true genius, he is driven to feel humbly human
by the exultation of him.

SWITHIN:  He breathes in a rarified air.

OSIER:  I was thrilled, I caught at passing beauties.  I see that here
and there I have jotted down incoherencies, lines have seduced me, so
that I missed the sequence--the precious part.  Ladies, permit me to rank
him with Plato as to the equality of women and men.

WINIFRED:  It is nobly said.

OSIER:  And with the Stoics, in regard to celibacy.

     (By this time all the ladies have gone into the house.)

ARDEN:  Successor!  Was the word successor?

     (ARDEN, SWITHIN, and OSIER are excitedly searching the notes when
     SPIRAL passes and strolls into the house.  His air of self-
     satisfaction increases their uneasiness they follow him.  ASTRAEA
     and LYRA come down the path.)



                                 SCENE V

                              ASTRAEA, LYRA


LYRA:  Oh!  Pluriel, ask me of him!  I wish I were less sure he would not
be at the next corner I turn.

ASTRAEA:  You speak of your husband strangely, Lyra.

LYRA:  My head is out of a sack.  I managed my escape from him this
morning by renouncing bath and breakfast; and what a relief, to be in the
railway carriage alone! that is, when the engine snorted.  And if I set
eyes on him within a week, he will hear some truths.  His idea of
marriage is, the taking of the woman into custody.  My hat is on, and on
goes Pluriel's.  My foot on the stairs; I hear his boot behind me.  In my
boudoir I am alone one minute, and then the door opens to the inevitable.
I pay a visit, he is passing the house as I leave it.  He will not even
affect surprise.  I belong to him, I am cat's mouse.  And he will look
doating on me in public.  And when I speak to anybody, he is that fearful
picture of all smirks.  Fling off a kid glove after a round of calls;
feel your hand--there you have me now that I am out of him for my half a
day, if for as long.

ASTRAEA:  This is one of the world's happy marriages!

LYRA:  This is one of the world's choice dishes!  And I have it planted
under my nostrils eternally.  Spare me the mention of Pluriel until he
appears; that's too certain this very day.  Oh! good husband! good kind
of man! whatever you please; only some peace, I do pray, for the husband-
haunted wife.  I like him, I like him, of course, but I want to breathe.
Why, an English boy perpetually bowled by a Christmas pudding would come
to loathe the mess.

ASTRAEA:  His is surely the excess of a merit.

LYRA:  Excess is a poison.  Excess of a merit is a capital offence in
morality.  It disgusts, us with virtue.  And you are the cunningest of
fencers, tongue, or foils.  You lead me to talk of myself, and I hate the
subject.  By the way, you have practised with Mr. Arden.

ASTRAEA:  A tiresome instructor, who lets you pass his guard to
compliment you on a hit.

LYRA:  He rather wins me.

ASTRAEA:  He does at first.

LYRA:  Begins Plurielizing, without the law to back him, does he?

ASTRAEA:  The fencing lessons are at an end.

LYRA:  The duetts with Mr. Swithin's violoncello continue?

ASTRAEA:  He broke through the melody.

LYRA:  There were readings in poetry with Mr. Osier, I recollect.

ASTRAEA:  His own compositions became obtrusive.

LYRA:  No fencing, no music, no poetry!  no West Coast of Africa either,
I suppose.

ASTRAEA:  Very well!  I am on my defence.  You at least shall not
misunderstand me, Lyra.  One intense regret I have; that I did not live
in the time of the Amazons.  They were free from this question of
marriage; this babble of love.  Why am I so persecuted?  He will not take
a refusal.  There are sacred reasons.  I am supported by every woman
having the sense of her dignity.  I am perverted, burlesqued by the fury
of wrath I feel at their incessant pursuit.  And I despise Mr. Osier and
Mr. Swithin because they have an air of pious agreement with the Dame,
and are conspirators behind their mask.

LYRA:  False, false men!

ASTRAEA:  They come to me.  I am complimented on being the vulnerable
spot.

LYRA:  The object desired is usually addressed by suitors, my poor
Astraea!

ASTRAEA:  With the assumption, that as I am feminine I must necessarily
be in the folds of the horrible constrictor they call Love, and that I
leap to the thoughts of their debasing marriage.

LYRA:  One of them goes to Mr. Homeware.

ASTRAEA:  All are sent to him in turn.  He can dispose of them.

LYRA:  Now that is really masterly fun, my dear; most creditable to you!
Love, marriage, a troop of suitors, and uncle Homeware.  No, it would not
have occurred to me, and--I am considered to have some humour.  Of
course, he disposes of them.  He seemed to have a fairly favourable
opinion of Mr. Arden.

ASTRAEA:  I do not share it.  He is the least respectful of the
sentiments entertained by me.  Pray, spare me the mention of him, as you
say of your husband.  He has that pitiful conceit in men, which sets them
thinking that a woman must needs be susceptible to the declaration of the
mere existence of their passion.  He is past argument.  Impossible for
him to conceive a woman's having a mind above the conditions of her sex.
A woman, according to him, can have no ideal of life, except as a ball to
toss in the air and catch in a cup.  Put him aside.  .  .  . We creatures
are doomed to marriage, and if we shun it, we are a kind of cripple.
He is grossly earthy in his view of us.  We are unable to move a step
in thought or act unless we submit to have a husband.  That is his
reasoning.  Nature!  Nature!  I have to hear of Nature!  We must be above
Nature, I tell him, or, we shall be very much below.  He is ranked among
our clever young men; and he can be amusing.  So far he passes muster;
and he has a pleasant voice.  I dare say he is an uncle Homeware's good
sort of boy.  Girls like him.  Why does he not fix his attention upon one
of them; Why upon me?  We waste our time in talking of him .  .  .  .
The secret of it is, that he has no reverence.  The marriage he vaunts is
a mere convenient arrangement for two to live together under command of
nature.  Reverence for the state of marriage is unknown to him.  How
explain my feeling?  I am driven into silence.  Cease to speak of him
. . . .  He is the dupe of his eloquence--his passion, he calls it.
I have only to trust myself to him, and--I shall be one of the world's
married women!  Words are useless.  How am I to make him see that it is
I who respect the state of marriage by refusing; not he by perpetually
soliciting.  Once married, married for ever.  Widow is but a term.  When
women hold their own against him, as I have done, they will be more
esteemed.  I have resisted and conquered.  I am sorry I do not share in
the opinion of your favourite.

LYRA:  Mine?

ASTRAEA:  You spoke warmly of him.

LYRA:  Warmly, was it?

ASTRAEA:  You are not blamed, my dear: he has a winning manner.

LYRA:  I take him to be a manly young fellow, smart enough; handsome too.

ASTRAEA:  Oh, he has good looks.

LYRA:  And a head, by repute.

ASTRAEA:  For the world's work, yes.

LYRA:  Not romantic.

ASTRAEA:  Romantic ideas are for dreamy simperers.

LYRA:  Amazons repudiate them.

ASTRAEA:  Laugh at me.  Half my time I am laughing at myself.  I should
regain my pride if I could be resolved on a step.  I am strong to resist;
I have not strength to move.

LYRA:  I see the sphinx of Egypt!

ASTRAEA:  And all the while I am a manufactory of gunpowder in this quiet
old-world Sabbath circle of dear good souls, with their stereotyped
interjections, and orchestra of enthusiasms; their tapering delicacies:
the rejoicing they have in their common agreement on all created things.
To them it is restful.  It spurs me to fly from rooms and chairs and beds
and houses.  I sleep hardly a couple of hours.  Then into the early
morning air, out with the birds; I know no other pleasure.

LYRA:  Hospital work for a variation: civil or military.  The former
involves the house-surgeon: the latter the grateful lieutenant.

ASTRAEA:  Not if a woman can resist .  .  .  I go to it proof-armoured.

LYRA:  What does the Dame say?

ASTRAEA:  Sighs over me!  Just a little maddening to hear.

LYRA:  When we feel we have the strength of giants, and are bidden to sit
and smile!  You should rap out some of our old sweet-innocent garden
oaths with her--'Carnation!  Dame!'  That used to make her dance on her
seat.--'But, dearest Dame, it is as natural an impulse for women to have
that relief as for men; and natural will out, begonia! it will!'  We ran
through the book of Botany for devilish objurgations.  I do believe our
misconduct caused us to be handed to the good man at the altar as the
right corrective.  And you were the worst offender.

ASTRAEA:  Was I?  I could be now, though I am so changed a creature.

LYRA:  You enjoy the studies with your Spiral, come!

ASTRAEA:  Professor Spiral is the one honest gentleman here.  He does
homage to my principles.  I have never been troubled by him: no silly
hints or side-looks--you know, the dog at the forbidden bone.

LYRA:  A grand orator.

ASTRAEA:  He is.  You fix on the smallest of his gifts.  He is
intellectually and morally superior.

LYRA:  Praise of that kind makes me rather incline to prefer his
inferiors.  He fed gobble-gobble on your puffs of incense.  I coughed
and scraped the gravel; quite in vain; he tapped for more and more.

ASTRAEA:  Professor Spiral is a thinker; he is a sage.  He gives women
their due.

LYRA:  And he is a bachelor too--or consequently.

ASTRAEA:  If you like you may be as playful with me as the Lyra of our
maiden days used to be.  My dear, my dear, how glad I am to have you
here!  You remind me that I once had a heart.  It will beat again with
you beside me, and I shall look to you for protection.  A novel request
from me.  From annoyance, I mean.  It has entirely altered my character.
Sometimes I am afraid to think of what I was, lest I should suddenly
romp, and perform pirouettes and cry 'Carnation!'  There is the bell.
We must not be late when the professor condescends to sit for meals.

LYRA:  That rings healthily in the professor.

ASTRAEA:  Arm in arm, my Lyra.

LYRA:  No Pluriel yet!

     (They enter the house, and the time changes to evening of the same
     day.  The scene is still the garden.)



                                 SCENE VI

                              ASTRAEA, ARDEN

ASTRAEA:  Pardon me if I do not hear you well.

ARDEN:  I will not even think you barbarous.

ASTRAEA:  I am.  I am the object of the chase.

ARDEN:  The huntsman draws the wood, then, and not you.

ASTRAEA:
               At any instant I am forced to run,
               Or turn in my defence: how can I be
               Other than barbarous?  You are the cause.

ARDEN:  No: heaven that made you beautiful's the cause.

ASTRAEA:
               Say, earth, that gave you instincts.  Bring me down
               To instincts!  When by chance I speak awhile
               With our professor, you appear in haste,
               Full cry to sight again the missing hare.
               Away ideas!  All that's divinest flies!
               I have to bear in mind how young you are.

ARDEN:
               You have only to look up to me four years,
               Instead of forty!

ASTRAEA:  Sir?



ARDEN
                    There's my misfortune!
               And worse that, young, I love as a young man.
               Could I but quench the fire, I might conceal
               The youthfulness offending you so much.

ASTRAEA:  I wish you would.  I wish it earnestly.

ARDEN:  Impossible.  I burn.

ASTRAEA:  You should not burn.

ARDEN
               'Tis more than I.  'Tis fire.  It masters will.
               You would not say I should not' if you knew fire.
               It seizes.  It devours.

ASTRAEA:  Dry wood.

ARDEN:
               Cold wit!
               How cold you can be!  But be cold, for sweet
               You must be.  And your eyes are mine: with them
               I see myself: unworthy to usurp
               The place I hold a moment.  While I look
               I have my happiness.

ASTRAEA:  You should look higher.

ARDEN:
               Through you to the highest.  Only through you!
                    Through you
               The mark I may attain is visible,
               And I have strength to dream of winning it.
               You are the bow that speeds the arrow: you
               The glass that brings the distance nigh.  My world
               Is luminous through you, pure heavenly,
               But hangs upon the rose's outer leaf,
               Not next her heart.  Astraea!  my own beloved!

ASTRAEA:  We may be excellent friends.  And I have faults.

ARDEN:  Name them: I am hungering for more to love.

ASTRAEA:
               I waver very constantly:  I have
               No fixity of feeling or of sight.
               I have no courage: I can often dream
               Of daring: when I wake I am in dread.
               I am inconstant as a butterfly,
               And shallow as a brook with little fish!
               Strange little fish, that tempt the small boy's net,
               But at a touch straight dive!  I am any one's,
               And no one's!  I am vain.
               Praise of my beauty lodges in my ears.
               The lark reels up with it; the nightingale
               Sobs bleeding; the flowers nod; I could believe
               A poet, though he praised me to my face.

ARDEN:
               Never had poet so divine a fount
               To drink of!

ASTRAEA:
               Have I given you more to love

ARDEN:
               More!  You have given me your inner mind,
               Where conscience in the robes of Justice shoots
               Light so serenely keen that in such light
               Fair infants, I newly criminal of earth,'
               As your friend Osier says, might show some blot.
               Seraphs might!  More to love?  Oh!  these dear faults
               Lead you to me like troops of laughing girls
               With garlands.  All the fear is, that you trifle,
               Feigning them.

ASTRAEA:
               For what purpose?

ARDEN:
                         Can I guess?

ASTRAEA:

               I think 'tis you who have the trifler's note.
               My hearing is acute, and when you speak,
               Two voices ring, though you speak fervidly.
               Your Osier quotation jars.  Beware!
               Why were you absent from our meeting-place
               This morning?


.

ARDEN:
                    I was on the way, and met
               Your uncle Homeware

ASTRAEA:  Ah!

ARDEN:  He loves you.

ASTRAEA:
               He loves me: he has never understood.
               He loves me as a creature of the flock;
               A little whiter than some others.
               Yes; He loves me, as men love; not to uplift;
               Not to have faith in; not to spiritualize.
               For him I am a woman and a widow
               One of the flock, unmarked save by a brand.
               He said it!--You confess it!  You have learnt
               To share his error, erring fatally.

ARDEN:  By whose advice went I to him?

ASTRAEA:
                              By whose?
               Pursuit that seemed incessant: persecution.
               Besides, I have changed since then: I change; I change;
               It is too true I change.  I could esteem
               You better did you change.  And had you heard
               The noble words this morning from the mouth
               Of our professor, changed were you, or raised
               Above love-thoughts, love-talk, and flame and flutter,
               High as eternal snows.  What said he else,
               My uncle Homeware?

ARDEN:
                         That you were not free:
               And that he counselled us to use our wits.

ASTRAEA:
               But I am free I free to be ever free!
               My freedom keeps me free!  He counselled us?
               I am not one in a conspiracy.
               I scheme no discord with my present life.
               Who does, I cannot look on as my friend.
               Not free?  You know me little.  Were I chained,
               For liberty I would sell liberty
               To him who helped me to an hour's release.
               But having perfect freedom .  .  .

ARDEN: No.

ASTRAEA:
               Good sir,
               You check me?

ARDEN: Perfect freedom?

ASTRAEA: Perfect!

ARDEN: No!

ASTRAEA:  Am I awake?  What blinds me?

ARDEN:
                                   Filaments
               The slenderest ever woven about a brain
               From the brain's mists, by the little sprite called
                    Fancy.
               A breath would scatter them; but that one breath
               Must come of animation.  When the heart
               Is as, a frozen sea the brain spins webs.

ASTRAEA:
               'Tis very singular!
               I understand.
               You translate cleverly.  I hear in verse
               My uncle Homeware's prose.  He has these notions.
               Old men presume to read us.

ARDEN:
               Young men may.
               You gaze on an ideal reflecting you
               Need I say beautiful?  Yet it reflects
               Less beauty than the lady whom I love
               Breathes, radiates.  Look on yourself in me.
               What harm in gazing?  You are this flower
               You are that spirit.  But the spirit fed
               With substance of the flower takes all its bloom!
               And where in spirits is the bloom of the flower?

ASTRAEA:
               'Tis very singular.  You have a tone
               Quite changed.

ARDEN:
               You wished a change.  To show you, how
               I read you . . .

ASTRAEA:
               Oh!  no, no.  It means dissection.
               I never heard of reading character
               That did not mean dissection.  Spare me that.
               I am wilful, violent, capricious, weak,
               Wound in a web of my own spinning-wheel,
               A star-gazer, a riband in the wind .  .  .

ARDEN:
               A banner in the wind!  and me you lead,
               And shall!  At least, I follow till I win.

ASTRAEA:
               Forbear, I do beseech you.

ARDEN:
                              I have had
               Your hand in mine.

ASTRAEA:
               Once.

ARDEN:
                              Once!
               Once!  'twas; once, was the heart alive,
               Leaping to break the ice.  Oh!  once, was aye
               That laughed at frosty May like spring's return.
               Say you are terrorized: you dare not melt.
               You like me; you might love me; but to dare,
               Tasks more than courage.  Veneration, friends,
               Self-worship, which is often self-distrust,
               Bar the good way to you, and make a dream
               A fortress and a prison.

ASTRAEA:
                              Changed!  you have changed
               Indeed.  When you so boldly seized my hand
               It seemed a boyish freak, done boyishly.
               I wondered at Professor Spiral's choice
               Of you for an example, and our hope.
               Now you grow dangerous.  You must have thought,
               And some things true you speak-save 'terrorized.'
               It may be flattering to sweet self-love
               To deem me terrorized.--'Tis my own soul,
               My heart, my mind, all that I hold most sacred,
               Not fear of others, bids me walk aloof.
               Who terrorizes me?  Who could?  Friends?  Never!
               The world? as little.  Terrorized!

ARDEN:
                              Forgive me.

ASTRAEA:
               I might reply, Respect me.  If I loved,
               If I could be so faithless as to love,
               Think you I would not rather noise abroad
               My shame for penitence than let friends dwell
               Deluded by an image of one vowed
               To superhuman, who the common mock
               Of things too human has at heart become.

ARDEN:
               You would declare your love?

ASTRAEA:
                              I said, my shame.
               The woman that's the widow is ensnared,
               Caught in the toils! away with widows!--Oh!
               I hear men shouting it.

ARDEN:
               But shame there's none
               For me in loving: therefore I may take
               Your friends to witness?  tell them that my pride
               Is in the love of you?

ASTRAEA:
                              'Twill soon bring
               The silence that should be between us two,
               And sooner give me peace.

ARDEN:
               And you consent?

ASTRAEA:
               For the sake of peace and silence I consent,
               You should be warned that you will cruelly
               Disturb them.  But 'tis best.  You should be warned
               Your pleading will be hopeless.  But 'tis best.
               You have my full consent.  Weigh well your acts,
               You cannot rest where you have cast this bolt
               Lay that to heart, and you are cherished, prized,
               Among them: they are estimable ladies,
               Warmest of friends; though you may think they soar
               Too loftily for your measure of strict sense
               (And as my uncle Homeware's pupil, sir,
               In worldliness, you do), just minds they have:
               Once know them, and your banishment will fret.
               I would not run such risks.  You will offend,
               Go near to outrage them; and perturbate
               As they have not deserved of you.  But I,
               Considering I am nothing in the scales
               You balance, quite and of necessity
               Consent.  When you have weighed it, let me hear.
               My uncle Homeware steps this way in haste.
               We have been talking long, and in full view !



                                SCENE VII

                         ASTRAEA, ARDEN, HOMEWARE

HOMEWARE:
               Astraea, child!  You, Arden, stand aside.
               Ay, if she were a maid you might speak first,
               But being a widow she must find her tongue.
               Astraea, they await you.  State the fact
               As soon as you are questioned, fearlessly.
               Open the battle with artillery.

ASTRAEA:
               What is the matter, uncle Homeware?

HOMEWARE (playing fox):
                                   What?
               Why, we have watched your nice preliminaries
               From the windows half the evening.  Now run in.
               Their patience has run out, and, as I said,
               Unlimber and deliver fire at once.
               Your aunts Virginia and Winifred,
               With Lady Oldlace, are the senators,
               The Dame for Dogs.  They wear terrific brows,
               But be not you affrighted, my sweet chick,
               And tell them uncle Homeware backs your choice,
               By lawyer and by priests! by altar, fount,
               And testament!

ASTRAEA:
               My choice!  what have I chosen?

HOMEWARE:
               She asks?  You hear her, Arden?--what and whom!

ARDEN:
               Surely, sir!  .  .  . heavens!  have you . . .

HOMEWARE:
                                   Surely the old fox,
               In all I have read, is wiser than the young:
               And if there is a game for fox to play,
               Old fox plays cunningest.

ASTRAEA:
               Why fox?  Oh!  uncle,
               You make my heart beat with your mystery;
               I never did love riddles.  Why sit they
               Awaiting me, and looking terrible?

HOMEWARE:
               It is reported of an ancient folk
               Which worshipped idols, that upon a day
               Their idol pitched before them on the floor

ASTRAEA:
               Was ever so ridiculous a tale!

HOMEWARE
               To call the attendant fires to account
               Their elders forthwith sat .  .  .

ASTRAEA:
                                   Is there no prayer
               Will move you, uncle Homeware?

HOMEWARE:
                              God-daughter,
               This gentleman for you I have proposed
               As husband.

ASTRAEA:
               Arden! we are lost.

ARDEN:
                                   Astraea!
               Support him!  Though I knew not his design,
               It plants me in mid-heaven.  Would it were
               Not you, but I to bear the shock.  My love!
               We lost, you cry; you join me with you lost!
               The truth leaps from your heart: and let it shine
               To light us on our brilliant battle day
               And victory

ASTRAEA:
               Who betrayed me!

HOMEWARE:
                              Who betrayed?
               Your voice, your eyes, your veil, your knife and fork;
               Your tenfold worship of your widowhood;
               As he who sees he must yield up the flag,
               Hugs it oath-swearingly!  straw-drowningly.
               To be reasonable: you sent this gentleman
               Referring him to me .  .  .  .

ASTRAEA:
                                        And that is false.
               All's false.  You have conspired.  I am disgraced.
               But you will learn you have judged erroneously.
               I am not the frail creature you conceive.
               Between your vision of life's aim, and theirs
               Who presently will question me, I cling
               To theirs as light: and yours I deem a den
               Where souls can have no growth.

HOMEWARE:
               But when we touched
               The point of hand-pressings, 'twas rightly time
               To think of wedding ties?

ASTRAEA:
               Arden, adieu!

                    (She rushes into house.)



                                SCENE VIII

                             ARDEN, HOMEWARE


ARDEN:
               Adieu!  she said.  With her that word is final.

HOMEWARE:
               Strange!  how young people blowing words like clouds
               On winds, now fair, now foul, and as they please
               Should still attach the Fates to them.

ARDEN:
                              She's wounded
               Wounded to the quick!

HOMEWARE:
                         The quicker our success: for short
               Of that, these dames, who feel for everything,
               Feel nothing.

ARDEN:
                         Your intention has been kind,
               Dear sir, but you have ruined me.

HOMEWARE:
                         Good-night. (Going.)

ARDEN:
               Yet she said, we are lost, in her surprise.

HOMEWARE:
               Good morning.  (Returning.)

ARDEN:
                         I suppose that I am bound
               (If I could see for what I should be glad!)
               To thank you, sir.

HOMEWARE:
                         Look hard but give no thanks.
               I found my girl descending on the road
               Of breakneck coquetry, and barred her way.
               Either she leaps the bar, or she must back.
               That means she marries you, or says good-bye.
                                        (Going again.)

ARDEN:
               Now she's among them.  (Looking at window.)

HOMEWARE:
               Now she sees her mind.

ARDEN:
               It is my destiny she now decides!

HOMEWARE:
               There's now suspense on earth and round the spheres.

ARDEN:
               She's mine now: mine!  or I am doomed to go.

HOMEWARE:
               The marriage ring, or the portmanteau now!

ARDEN:
               Laugh as you like, air!  I am not ashamed
               To love and own it.

OFFICER AND MAN

From “The Tapu Of Banderah and Other Stories”

By Louis Becke

C. Arthur Pearson Ltd.

1901

The anchor of her Majesty's ship _Hannibal_ was underfoot and the
captain on the bridge, and Rear-Admiral Garnet had shaken hands with
the last of the “leading” Fijian white residents, who always did the
welcoming and farewelling when distinguished persons visited Levuka,
when Lieutenant Bollard approached him and intimated that “a person”
 from the shore had just come alongside in a boat and desired to see “his
Excellency on private and important business.”

“What the devil does the fellow want?” said the Admiral irascibly, not
a whit softened by the “his Excellency” style of address; “I'm going on
the bridge, and can't see any one now; we can't delay the ship and get
into a mess going through the passage.”

“Told him so, sir; but he says he wants to see you upon an important--a
most pressing matter.”

“Oh, well! Confound him! Let the sentry show him to my cabin, and tell
Captain Bracely I shall be up in five minutes.”

The “person,” conducted by the sentry, was shown into the cabin, where
the Admiral, without taking a seat or offering one to his visitor,
inquired with a cold, cautious politeness born of much experience of
island visitors with “important and private Service matters of great
urgency,” what he might be pleased to want?

The stranger was a short, fat, coarse-looking man with little pig-like
eyes and scanty tufts of black beard and whiskers growing in irregular
patches on his cheeks and chin, like clumps of gorse on clayey banks.
He was dressed--in a manner--in an ill-fitting black cloth suit imported
from Sydney. His hair was very black and shiny, plastered down over
his temples and beautifully parted at the back of his bullet head.
Altogether he was an unpleasantly sleek, oleaginous creature, and as
he stood bowing and smirking with a catlike grin, the Admiral felt
an almost irresistible impulse to kick him out of the cabin.
Notwithstanding his haste, however, he began to recollect the man as an
individual who had been introduced to him a few days previously at some
municipal function.

“Can't recollect the fellow's name,” he muttered to himself. “I wonder
what the devil the creature wants! Got a complaint against the Consul
very likely--every one has a complaint against a Consul--it's a disease
in the South Seas. Confound their twopenny-halfpenny squabbles!” Then
the little fat man, with another servile grin, spoke.

“I wish, your Excellency, to see you upon a matter which I think, as
a loyal subject, it is my duty--my painful duty--to bring under your
notice.”

“Thought as much,” said the Admiral to himself. “Some row about a
trader insulting a native teacher, or _vice-versa_.” Then smothering an
exclamation of impatience, he said--

“What is it, sir? I have no time to lose. By the way, who are you, sir?”

“My name, your Excellency, is Obadiah Howl-man. I had the distinguished
honour, your Excellency, of showing your Excellency over the grounds of
the new Mission College. I was the contractor for the erection of that
ornament to our little town.” And again the oily creature smirked and
bowed and did the invisible soap business.

“Surely _you_ are not a missionary, sir?” asked the Admiral, with
undisguised contempt.

“I am not, your Excellency. That is, I am not yet an ordained labourer
in the Vineyard, your Excellency; but I hope soon to be one. Meanwhile,
all the time that is left to me from my business (I am a storekeeper and
contractor) is given to the cause of spreading the Light I was once a
lost soul, your----”

“I see, I see,” interrupted the Admiral, with ill-disguised disgust
and open impatience, “but do, for Heaven's sake, tell me what is your
complaint. I am due in Sydney on the tenth of this month, and the ship
is already under way. As it is, we shall have to stop outside the reef
to let you get into your boat.”

“I am aware of it, your Excellency, and I should not have ventured to
detain you, but this is a very serious matter--I may say, a criminal
matter. When I had the honour of meeting your Excellency, on the
occasion of your Excellency's visit to the College, I would have spoken
of this matter then; but my poor, weak nature was so torn by conflicting
emotions that I _could_ not And for the past two nights have I struggled
and wrestled in spirit, and sought Divine guidance. 'Tis indeed hard for
one man to reveal the sins and wickedness of a fellow-sinner--knowing
that we are all but weak vessels. But yet in this case it is my bounden
duty as a loyal----”

“Go on--go on, for Heaven's sake! What on earth is the matter? And what
the deuce do you want?”

“Your Excellency, I wish, in all sorrow and tribulation of spirit,
to give you information as to the whereabouts of a deserter from her
Majesty's Navy.”

“What do you mean, sir? None of my men are missing, and if any were, I'd
tell the Fijian police about it, and not delay the _Hannibal_,” and with
a curt nod the Admiral turned on his heel and was about to leave the
cabin, when the man stepped forward and interrupted him, saying--

“One word more, your Excellency. There is in connection with this
case----”

“The reward. Yes, of course. I forgot all about that. If there is a
deserter from any of her Majesty's ships living ashore here, you will
get the usual reward, I have no doubt. But really, sir, this is a matter
that you must arrange with the police when the next man-of-war comes
here, or go to the Consul”--and then, _sotto voce_--“or the devil,
confound you!” and the Admiral more than ever felt inclined to kick his
visitor out.

“You quite mistake me, Admiral Garnet I have no wish to claim an earthly
reward for doing my duty to my Queen and country. Since I have lived in
these islands the Lord has prospered me in my worldly affairs, and I am
in a position far above taking payment in money for doing my duty. I am,
I trust, walking in the Light, and do not want to obtain wealth--which
is but of this world--for performing such duty.”

“Well, well, I am sure I beg your pardon, Mr. Howlman. But now I really
cannot talk any longer here, so please do not keep me. At the same time
if there is a deserter here I don't see what business it is of yours to
interest yourself in his capture. Don't you think you have enough to do
to look after your store, and contracting, and your _alleged_ missionary
business, without running after deserters?” And inwardly the Admiral
cursed his visitor for a meddlesome ass. He was in a hurry to get to
sea, and yet this fellow might make it necessary for the ship to be
delayed till the deserter was apprehended.

“My humble connection with missionaries, Admiral, has taught me that, at
whatever cost to my own feelings, my duty as a loyal subject must, next
to my duty as a Christian, be performed honestly.”

“Oh, yes, yes. That's all right, I meant no disrespect to the
missionaries. Many of the _gentlemen_ engaged in missionary work in
these islands have rendered very valuable services to her Majesty's
ships on many occasions,” and then to himself, “and given us a devil of
a lot of trouble as well.”

“Now, sir,” the Admiral resumed, “having explained that the Consul
or police will attend to this deserter, you will allow me to say
'Good-day.'”

“One moment more, sir,” and a spiteful green lit up the little piggish
eyes. “I desire, as a British subject, to speak to you privately on
this matter, and to you alone. There are reasons--very particular
reasons--why her Majesty's Consul or the Fiji police here cannot deal
with this case.”

“Oh, well,” sighed the Admiral resignedly; “sit down, Mr. Howlman. I see
I am in for it, and so I'll send for my secretary and----”

“Cannot this matter be arranged without a third party?”

“No, sir; it CANNOT!”

The Admiral said this with so much emphasis, and rang the bell with so
much force at the same moment, that the sentry almost jumped into the
cabin to see what was the matter.

“Pass the word for Mr. Hayling to come to my cabin, and to the captain
that I shall not be with him for ten minutes yet. Ten minutes will do
your business, Mr. Howlman, eh?”

“Certainly, your Excellency,” and an evil smile crossed the man's
repulsive features.

The marine saluted, the secretary appeared, and the Admiral, nodding
towards Mr. Howlman in anything but a friendly manner, growled: “My
secretary, Mr. Hayling. This is Mr. Howlman, Mr. Hayling; he has a
communication to make about a deserter. Now, sir, proceed.”

“This,” said the man, producing a photograph and laying it on the table,
“is a portrait of a person named George Barcom, who, I have every reason
to believe, was a sergeant of marines on the _Flycatcher_ when she was
on this station five years ago.”

“Take charge of that photograph, Mr. Hayling. Go ahead, Mr. Howlman.”

“This man, after deserting from the _Flycatcher_ at a place in this
group called Yasawa, managed to make his way to the island of
Niuafou, where at that time I was in temporary charge of the Christian
Cultivation Association's trading station. He came to the island in
an open boat from the Yasawa Group, and was not suspected until quite
recently.”

“Deuced long time finding him out. But proceed, sir.”

“Guilty as the man was of the crime of desertion, I must yet, perforce,
say that he behaved himself very well. He was kindly received by the
King Tepuaka (a very earnest seeker after the Light), and all went well
for the space of four years.”

“Well, what happened then? Five minutes left,” and the Admiral looked at
his watch.

“My story will soon be told, your Excellency. The man, who calls
himself George Barcom, gained the affections of Tuilagi,{*} the youngest
daughter of the King. She, although not a seeker after the truth, was
yet beginning to display some interest in the teachings of Christianity,
and was an exceedingly comely young woman.” Here Mr. Howlman clasped
his fat hands together and cast up his eyes. “But her father, at my
suggestion, objected to their union. One night Barcom and the poor,
misguided girl were missing. They had fled in an open boat to another
island called Anuda--one of those dark places of the earth where the
good seed has not yet been sown.”

     * Tuilagi--“Queen of the Sky”; a name common in Polynesia.

“And what was the nature and reason of your objection to their
marriage?” said the Admiral quietly.

“I had every reason by this time to believe that the man was a deserter,
and in my capacity as a preacher of the Gospel--though not ordained as
such--I----”

“Confine yourself to the subject, if you please,” interrupted the
Admiral, with a mingled look of impatience and disgust. “You are not
a missionary, you tell me, and I'm hanged if I'm going to listen to a
sermon in my own cabin just now. Yet I have already given you as much
of my time as if you were one. But don't trespass on my good nature too
much.”

“I thought it my duty to interfere and prevent such a wicked and
improper marriage. And, your Excellency, this carrying away the young
woman against her father's wishes was very detrimental to the progress
of the Mission work. As I have said, she was beginning to evince a
certain concern for her soul----”

“Confound it, man! why will you so persistently harp upon irrevelant
matters that do not, as far as I can see, possibly concern what you
really want to tell me? Have you a brief to speak for the missionaries?
I am acquainted with the principal _gentlemen_ (again he emphasised the
word) who conduct mission work in the South Seas, but I'll be hanged if
I ever heard your name before--not even as a house-builder, or whatever
your vocation is.” And then, with a quick glance at the cunning
visage of Howlman, he added, “I suppose you knew this young woman very
well--perhaps were a particular friend of hers?”

Mr. Obadiah Howlman coughed. “Hm--er. Well, your Excellency, my dear
wife, who has now departed to her rest--an indeed well-earned rest--when
alive, took much interest in this young girl, and, before she was called
away, besought me to cherish and protect her. And, as time went on,
there _was_ formed, I may say, an attachment between this young creature
and myself--that is, of course, such an attachment as could exist
between a young woman of this kind, yearning for instruction, and her
spiritual adviser and guide.”

“Yes, yes; I quite understand, Mr. Howlman. Mr. Hayling has notes of
your statement, and the photograph. Now, if you will kindly keep your
own counsel on the matter, you will hear in due course that we have
arrested this man, and then, I think, you will be satisfied.”

Then turning to his secretary, the Admiral said, “The _Spitfire_ is due
at Levuka about the 8th. Write a letter to Commander Arness, and tell
him to call at Anuda and arrest a deserter from the marines, calling
himself George Barcom, and who can be identified by this photograph. He
is the only white man on the island, so this Mr. Howlman says, and
there should be no difficulty in finding him. That will satisfy you, I
presume, Mr. Howlman?”

“Quite, sir, I assure you. I have done my duty and----”

“Good-day, sir. You will just have time to get into your boat and get
ashore while we are in smooth water, and before we start the engines.”

The Admiral did not seem to notice the little fat man's outstretched
hand. The secretary bowed him out of the cabin, holding the photograph
in one hand and his notebook in the other. Neither of them liked his
look well enough to shake hands with him.

The Admiral, however, did not give the order to start the engines
immediately, for the sentry, in accordance with orders received from
the secretary, waited till Mr. Obadiah Howlman was at the foot of the
accommodation-ladder, and then called out, “Hold on that boat a minute
or two; the Admiral wants to send a letter ashore.”

For twenty minutes Mr. Howlman waited impatiently in the boat, and
then a big, official-looking letter was handed down the ladder to the
boatman, addressed: “O.H.M.S.--Commander Arness, H.M.S. _Spitfire_ care
of H.B.M. Consul, Levuka, Fiji.”

Mr. Howlman smiled to himself with the satisfied air of a man who
has done his duty. He knew the contents of the letter, and recognised
through its envelope the hard cardboard of the photograph of George
Barcom enclosed therein. There was also a smaller note, addressed to
Commander Arness by name, and marked, “Private letter.”

Five minutes later the _Hannibal_ steamed through the passage, and
shaped a course for Sydney.

*****

The _Spitfire_ was steaming full speed E.S.E. from Levuka. On the bridge
was Commander Arness talking to the navigating lieutenant, a young and
almost effeminate-looking officer.

The land had just been sighted, and lay right ahead.

“Will there be daylight enough left for us to get there and have this
wretched thing over, Carteret?” asked Commander Arness.

“Plenty, sir, if this weather keeps up and you don't want to stay there
more than a couple of hours.”

“No. Two hours should be ample time. This letter from Hayling explains
the whole business,” and he handed, the lieutenant the despatch from
the Admiral's secretary, which duly set forth that the _Spitfire_ was to
take on board a certain white trader living on Anuda--otherwise, Cherry
Island--and bring him prisoner to Sydney. His wife was to be returned
to her father at Niuafou. The last paragraph in the letter was to this
effect--

“Be careful to identify beyond doubt this alleged deserter. The
Rear-Admiral has received this information at the instant of sailing,
and he is by no means certain that the statements of his informant
can be depended upon. A photograph of the reputed deserter is enclosed
herewith. The Admiral thinks that Mr. Carteret may know the man, as he
was serving in the _Flycatcher_ five years ago.”

“This rascal Howlman has informed upon the poor devil for spite,” said
the Commander; “here's a private note from Hayling to myself about the
fellow.”

The lieutenant took the note and read--

     “My dear Arness,--Just a line on my own account. Be careful
     what you are doing in this business. The fellow who informed
     is a sort of hanger-on to the missionaries here. They don't
     think much of him, but seem to put up with the swab as a
     necessary evil. He confessed that jealousy had something to
     do with the matter, and I could see the Admiral wanted to
     kick him out of the cabin. Make sure that this man Barcom
     _is_ a deserter, or there will be the devil to pay if he
     should prove to be an American citizen, or anything of that
     kind.--Yours, CHARLES Hayling.”

“You see why they have left the matter to us, Carteret. You were on the
_Flycatcher_ five years ago, and the Admiral thinks you may be able to
identify this fellow. Of course Barcom is not his name.”

Mr. Carteret at this moment was very busy with the chart, over which he
bent his head a moment, and then turned sharply to the man at the wheel,
who was not out of earshot.

“Keep your course,” he said sharply; “why don't you attend to your
steering!” Then he turned to the commander: “I beg your pardon, sir; you
were saying?----”

“I was saying that you ought to remember such an incident as a sergeant
of marines deserting from the _Flycatcher_ when she was down here five
years ago.”

“I do remember it. The man's name was Charles Parker.”

“Is that the man?” And Arness handed him a photograph of a man dressed
in white ducks and a straw hat, evidently taken by an amateur.

Carteret looked at the photograph for fully a couple of minutes before
he answered slowly--

“No, I don't think that this is the man.”

A few hours later the _Spitfire_ had steamed in close to the land, and
a boat was lowered. In this boat were Lieutenant Carteret, a sergeant of
marines, with three privates and half a dozen bluejackets.

“I have force enough to take a boat-load of deserters,” remarked the
lieutenant to his commander, as he descended the poop ladder on his way
to the boat.

Commander Arness laughed. “Oh, well, you know the natives might take
it into their heads to resist his arrest. But be careful what you are
doing: make perfectly sure that he _is_ the man. You don't know what
complications might arise if we carried off the wrong person.”

* * * * *

The moment the boat touched the shore, she was surrounded by a crowd
of friendly, brown-skinned islanders, who seemed delighted to see the
strangers.

“Any one of you fellows speak English?” asked Mr. Carteret

“Yes, sir,” and a big, burly fellow with a fine open countenance
advanced to the officer. “Me speak English, and plenty more men here
speak it, too. What you want, sir?”

“Any white men living here?” asked Carteret quietly.

“Oh, yes--one, a very good man; his name is Joajai” [George].

“Take me to his house,” said the officer. “I want to see him.”

In a few minutes Mr. Carteret and his marines were being conducted up
a steep and rugged path towards the white trader's house, which was
situated quite apart from the native village, while the bluejackets were
left in the boat, remarking to each other that this white man was a most
cursed unfriendly sort of a chap not to come down to the beach when he
saw a man-of-war's boat ashore.

“Don't you be such a fool, Tom,” said the coxswain to one of the men.
“You're always a-jumpin' at conclusions too rapid. Just you wait a bit
and see. It's my belief that this chap has been up to something, and the
marines have gone with Carteret to scruff him and bring him aboard. I
saw the sergeant had a pair of darbies, and what do you suppose that
Carteret's come ashore with a regular escort for?”

A ten minutes' walk and Lieutenant Carteret and his men, guided by a
number of natives, reached the white man's thatched dwelling, which
stood amid a grove of banana and bread-fruit trees. When within a few
yards, the lieutenant saw a tall, graceful young native girl, clad in
semi-European style, advance to the open door, and then with a terrified
exclamation withdraw again.

“That is Tui,{*} Joajai's wife,” said one of the natives, pointing to
the girl, who now again appeared, and, with her full dark eyes dilated
with alarm, timidly held out her hand to the officer and murmured
something in the native tongue.

     * The diminutive of Tuilagi.

“She speaks English, but she is afraid of the men with the guns,”
 explained the native guide.

“Where is your husband?” said Lieutenant Carteret, motioning to the girl
to seat herself, and the marines to stand back.

She only shook her head, and turned inquiringly to the natives who
accompanied the officer.

“The white man is away on the other side of the island, sir. He be here
in 'bout one half-hour,” said the English-speaking native. “Suppose you
like, sir, I send some one go tell him come quick?”

Carteret hesitated a moment, then answered “No.” Then turning to the
sergeant of marines, he said, “Let your men fall still further back,
sergeant This is a delicate matter, and I don't want this confounded
crowd of natives, many of whom understand English, to hear what I have
to say to this woman. Send a man down to the boat, and tell the coxswain
that I shall have to wait for some time. If the ship makes a signal, the
boat can go off and tell the captain that I shall have to wait; then she
can come back for me.”

All this time the trader's young wife sat trembling upon a rude couch
that stretched across one side of the room; and her eyes never left
the officer's face for an instant, save when for a moment she gave a
terrified glance at the rifles and bayonets of the marine escort.

The moment that the marines had fallen back the lieutenant stepped
forward and took the young woman by the hand.

“Tui,” he said hurriedly, drawing her to the further end of the room
with firm but gentle hand, and speaking so low and without motion of his
lips that none but she knew that he spoke at all, “for God's sake and
for mine and your husband's, do not be frightened, but listen to me and
do exactly as I tell you.”

Still trembling like a startled fawn, the girl raised her lustrous eyes
to the young officer's face. His earnest, sincere manner and expression
of deep concern seemed to reassure her, and though her bosom heaved and
her breath came in quick, short gasps, she turned her face to him in the
confidence of dawning hope.

“Who are you, sir, and what do you wan' my husban' for?”

“Tell these natives to go,” said the lieutenant “Have no fear. I am your
husband's friend; but, _be quick_!”

Still, with a wondering look upon her beautiful face, the girl advanced
to the door, said something in the island tongue to the crowd of curious
natives, and then gently closed the door.

“This is a rum go!” said the sergeant of marines to himself, as he
saw the door shut to. “What the devil has the girl been doing? Are the
bracelets for her, I wonder?”

“Tui,” said Lieutenant Carteret, the moment they were alone, “time
presses. You speak English so well as to thoroughly understand that
which I am now about to tell you?”

“Yes, sir,” she answered, standing before him with clasped hands, “I
think so. A white woman who is dead now taught me to read and write
English, and my husban' always talk English to me.”

“Good. Then listen to me, my girl. I am Lieutenant Carteret, of H.M.S.
_Spitfire_--that ship out there--sent here with the ship's police to
arrest a deserter from the _Flycatcher_ on this station five years ago.
This is the man's photograph. He is said to be your husband, and calls
himself George Barcom. Now, when I was an officer of the _Flycatcher_,
I knew a man named Charles Parker”--her face went a deadly pallor--“who
deserted the ship at the Yasawa Group in Fiji. I can, without doubt,
identify this man. But, Tui, I have looked at this photograph when it
was held in the hand of my captain, and said that this is _not_ the man
whom I knew as Charles Parker. But look at it yourself and tell me--is
this the photograph of your husband, and is this man on this island?”

With shaking fingers she took it from him, looked at it, and then raised
her face to the officer.

“Is this the doin' of a man called Obadiah Howlman?”

“Yes,” answered the lieutenant, “it _is_ the work of Obadiah Howlman. He
brought this photograph to the Admiral only a few days ago.”

A savage gleam came into her eyes. “The brute! I kill him for _this_
some day!”

“That will not save your husband, my girl,” said Carteret; then he
waited a moment and added, “whatever it might do later on.”

Suddenly the girl's dark eyes filled with tears, and she laid her hand
on the officer's sleeve.

“What is to be done, sir? For God's sake don' you take my husband from
me, sir.”

“_This_ can be done. You have seen this photograph. You say that it is
not that of your husband, don't you? But, Tui, I must do my duty, do you
understand? I must see your husband.”

“And you are the man whose life he saved--for now I 'member your name
and the story he told me long ago--you who say you are his friend,
you would do this thing, you who in the ship gave him money so that he
might----”

“Wait, my girl, till I have finished; then you will understand. Listen
now. I will remain here, and you will yourself find your husband and
bring him here to this house so that I may see him. Bring him here
quickly, and by some way that my men cannot see his face. And then, Tui,
when I have spoken to him, then for your sake and for his sake I will
lie, and swear he is not the man I have been sent to take. Then, when
my ship has gone, you--you and he--you must promise me this, Tui--must
leave this island as quickly as possible; so that when Obadiah Howlman
sends another warship here--as he will do--they may not discover that I
am a liar and have been false to my duty.”

“Oh, sir, is this true? Surely you would not tell a lie to a poor native
girl like me?”

“Go, my girl”--and Carteret placed a kindly hand on her shoulder--“go
quickly to Parker--I know very well that he is not far off. _He_ will
believe what I say.”

For a moment she gazed intently into his face, as if she would read his
soul; and then seizing his hand pressed it to her lips, and went out by
the door that opened at the rear of the house.

Then the lieutenant opened the front door and walked slowly across to
where the marines were standing.

“Take your men out of sight, sergeant. I don't want this fellow
frightened until I know who he is. If he's the man we want, we'll have
no trouble in getting him. I've induced his wife to go and bring him.”

Whistling softly in an unconcerned manner, he turned back and stood at
the door of the house and waited there for perhaps ten minutes, until
he saw the girl returning with a white man, who appeared to be ill and
weak, for he had on a heavy top-coat, and a shawl wrapped round his neck
in such a way that his features were almost entirely hidden.

*****

Lieutenant Carteret allowed the man and woman to enter, and then
followed, closing the door after him.

As soon as he was inside, the white man threw off his muffler and turned
towards the officer.

“You must take me, sir,” he said, speaking calmly. “I cannot let you do
this for me. I know, sir, that you cannot help yourself.”

“No, by Heavens! Parker, I cannot take you. You jumped overboard and
saved my life. I tell you, man, that I _can't_ do it. Do you think I can
ever forget that awful thirty minutes, nearly six years ago, when you
kept me afloat off the Bampton Shoal? Now, Parker, just listen. I have a
plan; the whole thing is arranged as soon as we leave here. But you and
your wife _must_ get away from this island soon after the _Spitfire_
leaves. That infernal sweep, Howlman, will be sure to send another
man-of-war after you----”

“Listen to me, sir. I, too, have a plan. You shall not ruin yourself for
me. You are only a very young man, sir, and have the world before you.
I dread nothing but the temporary separation from Tui here. To me my
arrest means only dismissal from the service and a couple of years
in gaol; and likely enough, I shall get back here again without much
trouble.”

“No, I----”

“Don't waste time, sir. Call the escort, but for God's sake, sir, do the
thing quickly; look at my girl, sir, and let me get away before I break
down too, and act the coward. If you don't call the escort at once, I
will.”

“You madman, Parker,” began Carteret, and then Tui threw her arms round
her husband.

“Are you tired of me?” she sobbed. “Is this how you would leave the
woman who loves you, and who will be the mother of your child?”

The deserter caught her in his arms, and looking over his shoulder at
the lieutenant, said, “For God's sake, sir, don't wait. Call in your men
and get it over.”

“Parker, for Heaven's sake take this chance. I tell you, man, that I
have no fear for myself. I don't care a straw about the Service if this
is discovered.”

“Stand aside, sir. I'm not the man to let you sacrifice yourself for
me----” And unloosing his wife's arms from his neck, he advanced to the
door.

“Very well; it is your own fault.”

The next instant the lieutenant threw open the door.

“Sergeant, bring your men here.”

* * * * *

Half an hour later Lieutenant Carteret reported to Commander Arness.

“I have brought the prisoner on board, sir. He is a man named Charles
Parker, and was sergeant of marines on the _Flycatcher?_”

“Very good, Mr. Carteret What have you done with his wife?”

“She refused to leave, sir, and when we brought the man away, went off
to the other side of the island.”

* * * * *

When the _Spitfire_ reached Sydney, Charles Parker was duly tried by
court-martial, and in consequence of the friendly exertions of the
principal witness against him, Lieutenant Neil Carteret, was let
off lightly. He was dismissed from the service, and sentenced to
imprisonment in a Sydney jail for eighteen months.

When his time had expired, he managed, after a few months of waiting
about in Sydney, to work his way back to Anuda Island. And scarce had
the boat touched the beach when he was seized by the welcoming arms of
his native friends and carried ashore.

“Is it well with my wife, O friends?” he asked.

“It is well with her,” they answered; “in a little while we will take
you to her, but first let us tell thee of that which has befallen her on
this island.”

Then they told him.

*****

“One day after the warship had gone,” they said, “there came here a
trading schooner from Niuafou. On the ship were Tepuaka, the King of
Niuafou--the father of thy wife--and many of his men. And with him there
came also the little fat white man named Opataia [Obadiah]. All those
men that came with Tepuaka, the King, were _lotu_ [Christians]. No
sooner did they land, than Tepuaka and his friend, the fat little white
man, Opataia, walked to the house of his daughter, thy wife, Tui, but
all of his men he bade remain here in the village.

“'See,' said one of these men of Niuafou to us vauntingly, 'see what has
come to pass! Tuilagi refused to take for her husband the good and pious
man Opataia, but fled with this common white man, who is no better than
a heathen. And then what comes? This bad white man is caught by his
countrymen and put in a prison with chains upon his body. So now the
King comes for his daughter, for even now is Opataia willing to take
her, though she is but of little worth, to my mind.'

“While they spoke thus to us, Tepuaka and his white friend had gone to
thy house, and there did Tui, thy wife, meet them with smiles to hide
what lay in her heart.

“'Get thee ready, thou wicked woman,' said her father roughly to her;
'get thee ready quickly to leave this heathen land and return to thy own
country, where thou shalt be wife to this good man, Opataia, who desires
thee still.'

“'It is well, my father,' said Tui; 'but yet leave us now for a little.
Surely if this man desires me for his house he can speak to me with his
own mouth, and not through thine.'

“So her father went without the house, and Opataia, the white man,
remained with Tui.

“Then said the evil-faced white man to Tui: 'For the wrong that thou
did'st me by running away with that evil white man do I forgive thee,
for I love thee well.' And then he put his arms about her, and sought to
embrace her after the manner of a lover.

“And then from beneath her gown did Tui take out a little gun that fires
six bullets; and as the fat man, Opataia, pressed her to his bosom and
heeded not what she did, she placed the mouth of the little gun to the
side of his fat head. Then she said--

“'This do I, dog, for the husband of whom thou hast robbed me,' and then
there came a flash and a cry, and the white man sprang to his feet and
fell forward on his face--dead.

“Then Tui ran from the house. She fled from her father and came towards
the village, and Tepuaka the King followed her with death in his face.

“'Kill her!' he called to the men of Niuafou.

“But then we men of Anuda sprang to her aid with our clubs in our hands,
and she ran into our midst and called to us to save her from her father.

“So there was much talk, and then her father's wrath began to subside,
for we made him many presents of food for his journey back, and he went
away in peace.

“That is all. And see, Jaojai, hither comes thy wife with her son in her
arms to welcome thee home.”

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
