"1",768,"Wuthering Heights","Emily Brontë","Wuthering Heights  by Emily Brontë     CHAPTER I   1801—I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist’s Heaven—and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.  “Mr. Heathcliff?” I said.  A nod was the answer.  “Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—”  “Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,” he interrupted, wincing. “I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!”  The “walk in” was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, “Go to the Deuce!” even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.  When he saw my horse’s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the court,—“Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood’s horse; and bring up some wine.”  “Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,” was the reflection suggested by this compound order. “No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.”  Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy. “The Lord help us!” he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.  Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. “Wuthering” being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.  Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date “1500,” and the name “Hareton Earnshaw.” I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.  One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here “the house” pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.  The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose. Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling—to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He’ll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I’m running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.  While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I “never told my love” vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return—the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shame—shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.  By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.  I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.  “You’d better let the dog alone,” growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. “She’s not accustomed to be spoiled—not kept for a pet.” Then, striding to a side door, he shouted again, “Joseph!”  Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me _vis-à-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household in re-establishing peace.  Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm: I don’t think they moved one second faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the scene.  “What the devil is the matter?” he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.  “What the devil, indeed!” I muttered. “The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!”  “They won’t meddle with persons who touch nothing,” he remarked, putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. “The dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?”  “No, thank you.”  “Not bitten, are you?”  “If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.” Heathcliff’s countenance relaxed into a grin.  “Come, come,” he said, “you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your health, sir?”  I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his humour took that turn. He—probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant—relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,—a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.     CHAPTER II   Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.—I dine between twelve and one o’clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five)—on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles’ walk, arrived at Heathcliff’s garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.  On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.  “Wretched inmates!” I ejaculated, mentally, “you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don’t care—I will get in!” So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently. Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.  “What are ye for?” he shouted. “T’ maister’s down i’ t’ fowld. Go round by th’ end o’ t’ laith, if ye went to spake to him.”  “Is there nobody inside to open the door?” I hallooed, responsively.  “There’s nobbut t’ missis; and shoo’ll not oppen ’t an ye mak’ yer flaysome dins till neeght.”  “Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?”  “Nor-ne me! I’ll hae no hend wi’t,” muttered the head, vanishing.  The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the “missis,” an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute.  “Rough weather!” I remarked. “I’m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the consequence of your servants’ leisure attendance: I had hard work to make them hear me.”  She never opened her mouth. I stared—she stared also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.  “Sit down,” said the young man, gruffly. “He’ll be in soon.”  I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.  “A beautiful animal!” I commenced again. “Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?”  “They are not mine,” said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.  “Ah, your favourites are among these?” I continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.  “A strange choice of favourites!” she observed scornfully.  Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.  “You should not have come out,” she said, rising and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.  Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold.  “I don’t want your help,” she snapped; “I can get them for myself.”  “I beg your pardon!” I hastened to reply.  “Were you asked to tea?” she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.  “I shall be glad to have a cup,” I answered.  “Were you asked?” she repeated.  “No,” I said, half smiling. “You are the proper person to ask me.”  She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child’s ready to cry.  Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state.  “You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!” I exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; “and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter during that space.”  “Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; “I wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in. Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.”  “Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the Grange till morning—could you spare me one?”  “No, I could not.”  “Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.”  “Umph!”  “Are you going to mak’ the tea?” demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.  “Is _he_ to have any?” she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.  “Get it ready, will you?” was the answer, uttered so savagely that I started. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow. When the preparations were finished, he invited me with—“Now, sir, bring forward your chair.” And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.  I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their every-day countenance.  “It is strange,” I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another—“it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet, I’ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart—”  “My amiable lady!” he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his face. “Where is she—my amiable lady?”  “Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.”  “Well, yes—oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even when her body is gone. Is that it?”  Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.  Then it flashed upon me—“The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice.” The last reflection may seem conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.  “Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,” said Heathcliff, corroborating my surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.  “Ah, certainly—I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy,” I remarked, turning to my neighbour.  This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.  “Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,” observed my host; “we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.”  “And this young man is—”  “Not my son, assuredly.”  Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.  “My name is Hareton Earnshaw,” growled the other; “and I’d counsel you to respect it!”  “I’ve shown no disrespect,” was my reply, laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself.  He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.  The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.  “I don’t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,” I could not help exclaiming. “The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.”  “Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They’ll be covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,” said Heathcliff.  “How must I do?” I continued, with rising irritation.  There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out—“Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i’ idleness un war, when all on ’ems goan out! Bud yah’re a nowt, and it’s no use talking—yah’ll niver mend o’yer ill ways, but goa raight to t’ divil, like yer mother afore ye!”  I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her answer.  “You scandalous old hypocrite!” she replied. “Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil’s name? I warn you to refrain from provoking me, or I’ll ask your abduction as a special favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,” she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; “I’ll show you how far I’ve progressed in the Black Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The red cow didn’t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations!”  “Oh, wicked, wicked!” gasped the elder; “may the Lord deliver us from evil!”  “No, reprobate! you are a castaway—be off, or I’ll hurt you seriously! I’ll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the limits I fix shall—I’ll not say what he shall be done to—but, you’ll see! Go, I’m looking at you!”  The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and ejaculating “wicked” as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my distress.  “Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said earnestly, “you must excuse me for troubling you. I presume, because, with that face, I’m sure you cannot help being good-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to London!”  “Take the road you came,” she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair, with a candle, and the long book open before her. “It is brief advice, but as sound as I can give.”  “Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow, your conscience won’t whisper that it is partly your fault?”  “How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn’t let me go to the end of the garden wall.”  “_You_! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my convenience, on such a night,” I cried. “I want you to _tell_ me my way, not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.”  “Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you have?”  “Are there no boys at the farm?”  “No; those are all.”  “Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.”  “That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.”  “I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills,” cried Heathcliff’s stern voice from the kitchen entrance. “As to staying here, I don’t keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.”  “I can sleep on a chair in this room,” I replied.  “No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!” said the unmannerly wretch.  With this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend me.  “I’ll go with him as far as the park,” he said.  “You’ll go with him to hell!” exclaimed his master, or whatever relation he bore. “And who is to look after the horses, eh?”  “A man’s life is of more consequence than one evening’s neglect of the horses: somebody must go,” murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected.  “Not at your command!” retorted Hareton. “If you set store on him, you’d better be quiet.”  “Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,” she answered, sharply.  “Hearken, hearken, shoo’s cursing on ’em!” muttered Joseph, towards whom I had been steering.  He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.  “Maister, maister, he’s staling t’ lanthern!” shouted the ancient, pursuing my retreat. “Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him, holld him!”  On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out—on their peril to keep me one minute longer—with several incoherent threats of retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.  The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don’t know what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.  “Well, Mr. Earnshaw,” she cried, “I wonder what you’ll have agait next? Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house will never do for me—look at t’ poor lad, he’s fair choking! Wisht, wisht; you mun’n’t go on so. Come in, and I’ll cure that: there now, hold ye still.”  With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.  I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.     CHAPTER III   While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know, she answered: she had only lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not begin to be curious.  Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table.  I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.  The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters, large and small—_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.  In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw—Heathcliff—Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres—the air swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.  I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the inscription—“Catherine Earnshaw, her book,” and a date some quarter of a century back.  I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all. Catherine’s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary—at least the appearance of one—covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph,—rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.  “An awful Sunday,” commenced the paragraph beneath. “I wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute—his conduct to Heathcliff is atrocious—H. and I are going to rebel—we took our initiatory step this evening.  “All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire—doing anything but reading their Bibles, I’ll answer for it—Heathcliff, myself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us descending, ‘What, done already?’ On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.  “‘You forget you have a master here,’ says the tyrant. ‘I’ll demolish the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his hair as you go by: I heard him snap his fingers.’ Frances pulled his hair heartily, and then went and seated herself on her husband’s knee, and there they were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour—foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph, on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork, boxes my ears, and croaks:  “‘T’ maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o’ered, und t’ sound o’ t’ gospel still i’ yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye down, ill childer! there’s good books eneugh if ye’ll read ’em: sit ye down, and think o’ yer sowls!’  “Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!  “‘Maister Hindley!’ shouted our chaplain. ‘Maister, coom hither! Miss Cathy’s riven th’ back off “Th’ Helmet o’ Salvation,” un’ Heathcliff’s pawsed his fit into t’ first part o’ “T’ Brooad Way to Destruction!” It’s fair flaysome that ye let ’em go on this gait. Ech! th’ owd man wad ha’ laced ’em properly—but he’s goan!’  “Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, ‘owd Nick’ would fetch us as sure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a shelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is impatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman’s cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant suggestion—and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his prophecy verified—we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we are here.”  * * * * * *   I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took up another subject: she waxed lachrymose.  “How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!” she wrote. “My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I can’t give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond, and won’t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he and I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father (how dared he?) for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right place—”  * * * * * *   I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from manuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title—“Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.” And while I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep. Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I don’t remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.  I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrim’s staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we were journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text—“Seventy Times Seven;” and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the “First of the Seventy-First,” and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.  We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the clergyman’s stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached—good God! what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.  Oh, how weary I grew. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and revived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would _ever_ have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the “_First of the Seventy-First_.” At that crisis, a sudden inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.  “Sir,” I exclaimed, “sitting here within these four walls, at one stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to depart—Seventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninety-first is too much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down, and crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!”  “_Thou art the Man!_” cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his cushion. “Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage—seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul—Lo, this is human weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the Seventy-First is come. Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!”  With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim’s staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man’s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez’s part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than before.  This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also, the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when awake, but forgotten. “I must stop it, nevertheless!” I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!  The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,  “Let me in—let me in!”  “Who are you?” I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.  “Catherine Linton,” it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of _Linton_? I had read _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)—“I’m come home: I’d lost my way on the moor!”  As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child’s face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still it wailed, “Let me in!” and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening me with fear.  “How can I!” I said at length. “Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!”  The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.  I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!  “Begone!” I shouted. “I’ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.”  “It is twenty years,” mourned the voice: “twenty years. I’ve been a waif for twenty years!”  Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward.  I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright.  To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.  At last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer,  “Is any one here?”  I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff’s accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.  With this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.  Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.  “It is only your guest, sir,” I called out, desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. “I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. I’m sorry I disturbed you.”  “Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the—” commenced my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it steady. “And who showed you up into this room?” he continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. “Who was it? I’ve a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!”  “It was your servant Zillah,” I replied, flinging myself on to the floor, and rapidly resuming my garments. “I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it is—swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up, I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!”  “What do you mean?” asked Heathcliff, “and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven’s sake! don’t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were having your throat cut!”  “If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have strangled me!” I returned. “I’m not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham akin to you on the mother’s side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or however she was called—she must have been a changeling—wicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal transgressions, I’ve no doubt!”  Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliff’s with Catherine’s name in the book, which had completely slipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the offence, I hastened to add—“The truth is, sir, I passed the first part of the night in—” Here I stopped afresh—I was about to say “perusing those old volumes,” then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I went on—“in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or—”  “What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_” thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence. “How—how _dare_ you, under my roof?—God! he’s mad to speak so!” And he struck his forehead with rage.  I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of “Catherine Linton” before, but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the night: “Not three o’clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!”  “Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,” said my host, suppressing a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm’s shadow, dashing a tear from his eyes. “Mr. Lockwood,” he added, “you may go into my room: you’ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.”  “And for me, too,” I replied. “I’ll walk in the yard till daylight, and then I’ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. I’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.”  “Delightful company!” muttered Heathcliff. “Take the candle, and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard, though, the dogs are unchained; and the house—Juno mounts sentinel there, and—nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But, away with you! I’ll come in two minutes!”  I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears. “Come in! come in!” he sobbed. “Cathy, do come. Oh, do—_once_ more! Oh! my heart’s darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!” The spectre showed a spectre’s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out the light.  There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a querulous mew.  Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.  A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a “good-morning,” but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed, by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.  It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog, now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an indignant groan.  “And you, you worthless—” he broke out as I entered, turning to his daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep, but generally represented by a dash—. “There you are, at your idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread—you live on my charity! Put your trash away, and find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight—do you hear, damnable jade?”  “I’ll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,” answered the young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair. “But I’ll not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I please!”  Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance, obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and cold as impalpable ice.  My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges of mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday’s walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road.  We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own resources; for the porter’s lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.  My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming, tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured that I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs; whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study, feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.     CHAPTER IV   What vain weather-cocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable—I, weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.  “You have lived here a considerable time,” I commenced; “did you not say sixteen years?”  “Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her; after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.”  “Indeed.”  There ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her own affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having studied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated—“Ah, times are greatly changed since then!”  “Yes,” I remarked, “you’ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?”  “I have: and troubles too,” she said.  “Oh, I’ll turn the talk on my landlord’s family!” I thought to myself. “A good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise for kin.” With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior. “Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?” I inquired.  “Rich, sir!” she returned. “He has nobody knows what money, and every year it increases. Yes, yes, he’s rich enough to live in a finer house than this: but he’s very near—close-handed; and, if he had meant to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more. It is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!”  “He had a son, it seems?”  “Yes, he had one—he is dead.”  “And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?”  “Yes.”  “Where did she come from originally?”  “Why, sir, she is my late master’s daughter: Catherine Linton was her maiden name. I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would remove here, and then we might have been together again.”  “What! Catherine Linton?” I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute’s reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. “Then,” I continued, “my predecessor’s name was Linton?”  “It was.”  “And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr. Heathcliff? Are they relations?”  “No; he is the late Mrs. Linton’s nephew.”  “The young lady’s cousin, then?”  “Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother’s, the other on the father’s side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton’s sister.”  “I see the house at Wuthering Heights has ‘Earnshaw’ carved over the front door. Are they an old family?”  “Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of us—I mean, of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? I beg pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!”  “Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think, not very happy.”  “Oh dear, I don’t wonder! And how did you like the master?”  “A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character?”  “Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with him the better.”  “He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl. Do you know anything of his history?”  “It’s a cuckoo’s, sir—I know all about it: except where he was born, and who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.”  “Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.”  “Oh, certainly, sir! I’ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I’ll sit as long as you please. But you’ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and you must have some gruel to drive it out.”  The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find me so companionable.  * * * * *   Before I came to live here, she commenced—waiting no farther invitation to her story—I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton’s father, and I got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to. One fine summer morning—it was the beginning of harvest, I remember—Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me—for I sat eating my porridge with them—and he said, speaking to his son, “Now, my bonny man, I’m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You may choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!” Hindley named a fiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.  It seemed a long while to us all—the three days of his absence—and often did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw expected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o’clock, the door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master. He threw himself into a chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly killed—he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.  “And at the end of it to be flighted to death!” he said, opening his great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms. “See here, wife! I was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e’en take it as a gift of God; though it’s as dark almost as if it came from the devil.”  We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy’s head I had a peep at a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its face looked older than Catherine’s; yet when it was set on its feet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it. Well, the conclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.  Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored: then, both began searching their father’s pockets for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw’s door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.  This was Heathcliff’s first introduction to the family. On coming back a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I found they had christened him “Heathcliff”: it was the name of a son who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn’t reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.  He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment: he would stand Hindley’s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him. He took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.  So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at Mrs. Earnshaw’s death, which happened in less than two years after, the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent’s affections and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn’t wit to guess that I was compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble.  He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn’t dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one. Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley—  “You must exchange horses with me: I don’t like mine; and if you won’t I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you’ve given me this week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.” Hindley put out his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. “You’d better do it at once,” he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): “you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you’ll get them again with interest.” “Off, dog!” cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. “Throw it,” he replied, standing still, “and then I’ll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly.” Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused it. “Take my colt, Gipsy, then!” said young Earnshaw. “And I pray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper! and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what you are, imp of Satan.—And take that, I hope he’ll kick out your brains!”  Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will hear.     CHAPTER V   In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child’s pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley’s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that he could not do it.  At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said—“Hindley was nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.”  I hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two people—Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up yonder. He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him about his soul’s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly. He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw’s weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.  Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed, we had not a minute’s security that she wouldn’t be in mischief. Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going—singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same. A wild, wicked slip she was—but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us on his account. In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let her know.  Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look, and her ready words; turning Joseph’s religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most—showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination. After behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night. “Nay, Cathy,” the old man would say, “I cannot love thee, thou’rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask God’s pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared thee!” That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.  But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw’s troubles on earth. He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the fire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all together—I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy had been sick, and that made her still; she leant against her father’s knee, and Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair—it pleased him rarely to see her gentle—and saying, “Why canst thou not always be a good lass, Cathy?” And she turned her face up to his, and laughed, and answered, “Why cannot you always be a good man, father?” But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his fingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him. We all kept as mute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and called him by name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the candle and looked at him. I thought there was something wrong as he set down the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to “frame upstairs, and make little din—they might pray alone that evening—he had summut to do.”  “I shall bid father good-night first,” said Catherine, putting her arms round his neck, before we could hinder her. The poor thing discovered her loss directly—she screamed out—“Oh, he’s dead, Heathcliff! he’s dead!” And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.  I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then. However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children’s room: their door was ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing we were all there safe together.     CHAPTER VI   Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and—a thing that amazed us, and set the neighbours gossiping right and left—he brought a wife with him. What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father.  She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold, appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the mourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly—“Are they gone yet?” Then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping—and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn’t know; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely to die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don’t in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to us first.  Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.  She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning. Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy. He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm.  Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper. But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together again: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge; and many a time I’ve cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere. We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household went to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.  “Where is Miss Catherine?” I cried hurriedly. “No accident, I hope?” “At Thrushcross Grange,” he answered; “and I would have been there too, but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.” “Well, you will catch it!” I said: “you’ll never be content till you’re sent about your business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?” “Let me get off my wet clothes, and I’ll tell you all about it, Nelly,” he replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued—“Cathy and I escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their man-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they don’t answer properly?” “Probably not,” I responded. “They are good children, no doubt, and don’t deserve the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.” “Don’t cant, Nelly,” he said: “nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park, without stopping—Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You’ll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw—ah! it was beautiful—a splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn’t they have been happy? We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good children were doing? Isabella—I believe she is eleven, a year younger than Cathy—lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I’d not exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton’s at Thrushcross Grange—not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley’s blood!”  “Hush, hush!” I interrupted. “Still you have not told me, Heathcliff, how Catherine is left behind?”  “I told you we laughed,” he answered. “The Lintons heard us, and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and then a cry, ‘Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa, oh!’ They really did howl out something in that way. We made frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell down. ‘Run, Heathcliff, run!’ she whispered. ‘They have let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!’ The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out—no! she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting—‘Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!’ He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker’s game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I’m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. ‘What prey, Robert?’ hallooed Linton from the entrance. ‘Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,’ he replied; ‘and there’s a lad here,’ he added, making a clutch at me, ‘who looks an out-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir, don’t lay by your gun.’ ‘No, no, Robert,’ said the old fool. ‘The rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I’ll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don’t be afraid, it is but a boy—yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as well as features?’ He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping—‘Frightful thing! Put him in the cellar, papa. He’s exactly like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn’t he, Edgar?’  “While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to recognise her. They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet them elsewhere. ‘That’s Miss Earnshaw!’ he whispered to his mother, ‘and look how Skulker has bitten her—how her foot bleeds!’  “‘Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!’ cried the dame; ‘Miss Earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning—surely it is—and she may be lamed for life!’  “‘What culpable carelessness in her brother!’ exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from me to Catherine. ‘I’ve understood from Shielders’” (that was the curate, sir) “‘that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism. But who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to Liverpool—a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.’  “‘A wicked boy, at all events,’ remarked the old lady, ‘and quite unfit for a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I’m shocked that my children should have heard it.’  “I recommenced cursing—don’t be angry, Nelly—and so Robert was ordered to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly, secured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons—a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them—to everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?”  “There will more come of this business than you reckon on,” I answered, covering him up and extinguishing the light. “You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if he won’t.” My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found it impossible.     CHAPTER VII   Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, “Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?” “Isabella has not her natural advantages,” replied his wife: “but she must mind and not grow wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things—Stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls—let me untie your hat.”  I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.  Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and uncared for, before Catherine’s absence, he had been ten times more so since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention his clothes, which had seen three months’ service in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he expected. “Is Heathcliff not here?” she demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.  “Heathcliff, you may come forward,” cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself. “You may come and wish Miss Catherine welcome, like the other servants.”  Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, “Why, how very black and cross you look! and how—how funny and grim! But that’s because I’m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton. Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?”  She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.  “Shake hands, Heathcliff,” said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; “once in a way, that is permitted.”  “I shall not,” replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; “I shall not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!”  And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.  “I did not mean to laugh at you,” she said; “I could not hinder myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will be all right: but you are so dirty!”  She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his.  “You needn’t have touched me!” he answered, following her eye and snatching away his hand. “I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty.”  With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper.  After playing lady’s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires, befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph’s affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging Missy’s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness. They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that “naughty swearing boy.”  Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular care—the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad’s situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.  “Make haste, Heathcliff!” I said, “the kitchen is so comfortable; and Joseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.”  He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.  “Come—are you coming?” I continued. “There’s a little cake for each of you, nearly enough; and you’ll need half-an-hour’s donning.”  I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o’clock, and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly—“Nelly, make me decent, I’m going to be good.”  “High time, Heathcliff,” I said; “you _have_ grieved Catherine: she’s sorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her, because she is more thought of than you.”  The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.  “Did she say she was grieved?” he inquired, looking very serious.  “She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.”  “Well, _I_ cried last night,” he returned, “and I had more reason to cry than she.”  “Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach,” said I. “Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say—you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I have dinner to get ready, I’ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are younger, and yet, I’ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don’t you feel that you could?”  Heathcliff’s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed.  “But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn’t make him less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be!”  “And cried for mamma at every turn,” I added, “and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to the glass, and I’ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil’s spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don’t get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.”  “In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton’s great blue eyes and even forehead,” he replied. “I do—and that won’t help me to them.”  “A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,” I continued, “if you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly. And now that we’ve done washing, and combing, and sulking—tell me whether you don’t think yourself rather handsome? I’ll tell you, I do. You’re fit for a prince in disguise. Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week’s income, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!”  So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour into their white faces.  I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph “keep the fellow out of the room—send him into the garret till dinner is over. He’ll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them a minute.”  “Nay, sir,” I could not avoid answering, “he’ll touch nothing, not he: and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.”  “He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till dark,” cried Hindley. “Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks—see if I won’t pull them a bit longer!”  “They are long enough already,” observed Master Linton, peeping from the doorway; “I wonder they don’t make his head ache. It’s like a colt’s mane over his eyes!”  He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff’s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival. He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under his gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker’s face and neck; who instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless. I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar’s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.  “You should not have spoken to him!” she expostulated with Master Linton. “He was in a bad temper, and now you’ve spoilt your visit; and he’ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can’t eat my dinner. Why did you speak to him, Edgar?”  “I didn’t,” sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. “I promised mamma that I wouldn’t say one word to him, and I didn’t.”  “Well, don’t cry,” replied Catherine, contemptuously; “you’re not killed. Don’t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush, Isabella! Has anybody hurt _you?_”  “There, there, children—to your seats!” cried Hindley, bustling in. “That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar, take the law into your own fists—it will give you an appetite!”  The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her. “An unfeeling child,” I thought to myself; “how lightly she dismisses her old playmate’s troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.” She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals.  In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.  Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made no stay at the stairs’-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour’s, to be removed from the sound of our “devil’s psalmody,” as it pleased him to call it. I told them I intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterday’s dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered gravely—“I’m trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back. I don’t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last. I hope he will not die before I do!”  “For shame, Heathcliff!” said I. “It is for God to punish wicked people; we should learn to forgive.”  “No, God won’t have the satisfaction that I shall,” he returned. “I only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I’ll plan it out: while I’m thinking of that I don’t feel pain.”  But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I’m annoyed how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff’s history, all that you need hear, in half a dozen words.  * * * * *   Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I was very far from nodding. “Sit still, Mrs. Dean,” I cried; “do sit still another half-hour. You’ve done just right to tell the story leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or less.”  “The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.”  “No matter—I’m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.”  “You shouldn’t lie till ten. There’s the very prime of the morning gone long before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day’s work by ten o’clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.”  “Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold, at least.”  “I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw—”  “No, no, I’ll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently that puss’s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?”  “A terribly lazy mood, I should say.”  “On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and, therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year’s standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.”  “Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,” observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.  “Excuse me,” I responded; “you, my good friend, are a striking evidence against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think. You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.”  Mrs. Dean laughed.  “I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,” she said; “not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, from year’s end to year’s end; but I have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor man’s daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip’s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will be content to pass to the next summer—the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty-three years ago.”     CHAPTER VIII   On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling me as she ran.  “Oh, such a grand bairn!” she panted out. “The finest lad that ever breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she’s been in a consumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she has nothing to keep her, and she’ll be dead before winter. You must come home directly. You’re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because it will be all yours when there is no missis!”  “But is she very ill?” I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet.  “I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,” replied the girl, “and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She’s out of her head for joy, it’s such a beauty! If I were her I’m certain I should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps forward, and says he—‘Earnshaw, it’s a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt convinced we shouldn’t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will probably finish her. Don’t take on, and fret about it too much: it can’t be helped. And besides, you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass!’”  “And what did the master answer?” I inquired.  “I think he swore: but I didn’t mind him, I was straining to see the bairn,” and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very sad for Hindley’s sake. He had room in his heart only for two idols—his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn’t conceive how he would bear the loss.  When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and, as I passed in, I asked, “how was the baby?”  “Nearly ready to run about, Nell!” he replied, putting on a cheerful smile.  “And the mistress?” I ventured to inquire; “the doctor says she’s—”  “Damn the doctor!” he interrupted, reddening. “Frances is quite right: she’ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going upstairs? will you tell her that I’ll come, if she’ll promise not to talk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she must—tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.”  I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits, and replied merrily, “I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won’t speak: but that does not bind me not to laugh at him!”  Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn’t put him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, “I know you need not—she’s well—she does not want any more attendance from you! She never was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.”  He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her—a very slight one—he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about his neck, her face changed, and she was dead.  As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.  The master’s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_ possessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton’s visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side, and his wife’s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you might see something of what she was. Can you make that out?  Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw.  “A very agreeable portrait,” I observed to the house-keeper. “Is it like?”  “Yes,” she answered; “but he looked better when he was animated; that is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.”  Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her five-weeks’ residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first—for she was full of ambition—and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard Heathcliff termed a “vulgar young ruffian,” and “worse than a brute,” she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.  Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He had a terror of Earnshaw’s reputation, and shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her. I’ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser.  Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of. In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and any love for books or learning. His childhood’s sense of superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance.  Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother’s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.  “Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?” asked Heathcliff. “Are you going anywhere?”  “No, it is raining,” she answered.  “Why have you that silk frock on, then?” he said. “Nobody coming here, I hope?”  “Not that I know of,” stammered Miss: “but you should be in the field now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were gone.”  “Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,” observed the boy. “I’ll not work any more to-day: I’ll stay with you.”  “Oh, but Joseph will tell,” she suggested; “you’d better go!”  “Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will take him till dark, and he’ll never know.”  So saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected an instant, with knitted brows—she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion. “Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon,” she said, at the conclusion of a minute’s silence. “As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for no good.”  “Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,” he persisted; “don’t turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I’m on the point, sometimes, of complaining that they—but I’ll not—”  “That they what?” cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled countenance. “Oh, Nelly!” she added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands, “you’ve combed my hair quite out of curl! That’s enough; let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about, Heathcliff?”  “Nothing—only look at the almanack on that wall;” he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, “The crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with me. Do you see? I’ve marked every day.”  “Yes—very foolish: as if I took notice!” replied Catherine, in a peevish tone. “And where is the sense of that?”  “To show that I _do_ take notice,” said Heathcliff.  “And should I always be sitting with you?” she demanded, growing more irritated. “What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do, either!”  “You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked my company, Cathy!” exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.  “It’s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,” she muttered.  Her companion rose up, but he hadn’t time to express his feelings further, for a horse’s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and pronounced his words as you do: that’s less gruff than we talk here, and softer.  “I’m not come too soon, am I?” he said, casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.  “No,” answered Catherine. “What are you doing there, Nelly?”  “My work, Miss,” I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)  She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, “Take yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don’t commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!”  “It’s a good opportunity, now that master is away,” I answered aloud: “he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I’m sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.”  “I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,” exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.  “I’m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,” was my response; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation.  She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm. I’ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and screamed out, “Oh, Miss, that’s a nasty trick! You have no right to nip me, and I’m not going to bear it.”  “I didn’t touch you, you lying creature!” cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.  “What’s that, then?” I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to refute her.  She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water.  “Catherine, love! Catherine!” interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.  “Leave the room, Ellen!” she repeated, trembling all over.  Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out complaints against “wicked aunt Cathy,” which drew her fury on to his unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.  “That’s right!” I said to myself. “Take warning and begone! It’s a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.”  “Where are you going?” demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.  He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.  “You must not go!” she exclaimed, energetically.  “I must and shall!” he replied in a subdued voice.  “No,” she persisted, grasping the handle; “not yet, Edgar Linton: sit down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all night, and I won’t be miserable for you!”  “Can I stay after you have struck me?” asked Linton.  Catherine was mute.  “You’ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,” he continued; “I’ll not come here again!”  Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.  “And you told a deliberate untruth!” he said.  “I didn’t!” she cried, recovering her speech; “I did nothing deliberately. Well, go, if you please—get away! And now I’ll cry—I’ll cry myself sick!”  She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious earnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there he lingered. I resolved to encourage him.  “Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,” I called out. “As bad as any marred child: you’d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to grieve us.”  The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no saving him: he’s doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy—had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess themselves lovers.  Intelligence of Mr. Hindley’s arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out of the master’s fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun.     CHAPTER IX   He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast’s fondness or his madman’s rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.  “There, I’ve found it out at last!” cried Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of my neck, like a dog. “By heaven and hell, you’ve sworn between you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is always out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn’t laugh; for I’ve just crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one—and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!”  “But I don’t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,” I answered; “it has been cutting red herrings. I’d rather be shot, if you please.”  “You’d rather be damned!” he said; “and so you shall. No law in England can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine’s abominable! Open your mouth.”  He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably—I would not take it on any account.  “Oh!” said he, releasing me, “I see that hideous little villain is not Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin. Unnatural cub, come hither! I’ll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don’t you think the lad would be handsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce—get me a scissors—something fierce and trim! Besides, it’s infernal affectation—devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears—we’re asses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my darling! wisht, dry thy eyes—there’s a joy; kiss me. What! it won’t? Kiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a monster! As sure as I’m living, I’ll break the brat’s neck.”  Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father’s arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and lifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in his hands. “Who is that?” he asked, hearing some one approaching the stairs’-foot. I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell.  There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton’s skull on the steps; but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered and abashed.  “It is your fault, Ellen,” he said; “you should have kept him out of sight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?”  “Injured!” I cried angrily; “if he is not killed, he’ll be an idiot! Oh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him. You’re worse than a heathen—treating your own flesh and blood in that manner!”  He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if he would go into convulsions.  “You shall not meddle with him!” I continued. “He hates you—they all hate you—that’s the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state you’re come to!”  “I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,” laughed the misguided man, recovering his hardness. “At present, convey yourself and him away. And hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I wouldn’t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire: but that’s as my fancy goes.”  While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and poured some into a tumbler.  “Nay, don’t!” I entreated. “Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!”  “Any one will do better for him than I shall,” he answered.  “Have mercy on your own soul!” I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand.  “Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its Maker,” exclaimed the blasphemer. “Here’s to its hearty damnation!”  He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.  “It’s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,” observed Heathcliff, muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. “He’s doing his very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he would wager his mare that he’ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him.”  I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep. Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and remained silent.  I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,—  It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat, The mither beneath the mools heard that,   when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her head in, and whispered,—“Are you alone, Nelly?”  “Yes, Miss,” I replied.  She entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to say something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.  “Where’s Heathcliff?” she said, interrupting me.  “About his work in the stable,” was my answer.  He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two trickle from Catherine’s cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?—I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may come to the point as she will—I sha’n’t help her! No, she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.  “Oh, dear!” she cried at last. “I’m very unhappy!”  “A pity,” observed I. “You’re hard to please; so many friends and so few cares, and can’t make yourself content!”  “Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?” she pursued, kneeling down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it.  “Is it worth keeping?” I inquired, less sulkily.  “Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I’ve given him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.”  “Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?” I replied. “To be sure, considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.”  “If you talk so, I won’t tell you any more,” she returned, peevishly rising to her feet. “I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I was wrong!”  “You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have pledged your word, and cannot retract.”  “But say whether I should have done so—do!” she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.  “There are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly,” I said, sententiously. “First and foremost, do you love Mr. Edgar?”  “Who can help it? Of course I do,” she answered.  Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious.  “Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?”  “Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.”  “By no means; you must say why?”  “Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.”  “Bad!” was my commentary.  “And because he is young and cheerful.”  “Bad, still.”  “And because he loves me.”  “Indifferent, coming there.”  “And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.”  “Worst of all. And now, say how you love him?”  “As everybody loves—You’re silly, Nelly.”  “Not at all—Answer.”  “I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!”  “And why?”  “Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It’s no jest to me!” said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire.  “I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,” I replied. “You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without that, probably; and with it you wouldn’t, unless he possessed the four former attractions.”  “No, to be sure not: I should only pity him—hate him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.”  “But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from loving them?”  “If there be any, they are out of my way: I’ve seen none like Edgar.”  “You may see some; and he won’t always be handsome, and young, and may not always be rich.”  “He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would speak rationally.”  “Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry Mr. Linton.”  “I don’t want your permission for that—I _shall_ marry him: and yet you have not told me whether I’m right.”  “Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and easy: where is the obstacle?”  “_Here_! and _here_!” replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead, and the other on her breast: “in whichever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I’m convinced I’m wrong!”  “That’s very strange! I cannot make it out.”  “It’s my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I’ll explain it: I can’t do it distinctly; but I’ll give you a feeling of how I feel.”  She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver, and her clasped hands trembled.  “Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?” she said, suddenly, after some minutes’ reflection.  “Yes, now and then,” I answered.  “And so do I. I’ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they’ve gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is one: I’m going to tell it—but take care not to smile at any part of it.”  “Oh! don’t, Miss Catherine!” I cried. “We’re dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and like yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he’s_ dreaming nothing dreary. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!”  “Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing: nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen: it’s not long; and I’ve no power to be merry to-night.”  “I won’t hear it, I won’t hear it!” I repeated, hastily.  I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time.  “If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.”  “Because you are not fit to go there,” I answered. “All sinners would be miserable in heaven.”  “But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.”  “I tell you I won’t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I’ll go to bed,” I interrupted again.  She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.  “This is nothing,” cried she: “I was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other. I’ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn’t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he’s handsome, Nelly, but because he’s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton’s is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.”  Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff’s presence. Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I started, and bade her hush!  “Why?” she asked, gazing nervously round.  “Joseph is here,” I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road; “and Heathcliff will come in with him. I’m not sure whether he were not at the door this moment.”  “Oh, he couldn’t overhear me at the door!” said she. “Give me Hareton, while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you. I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that Heathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does not know what being in love is!”  “I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,” I returned; “and if _you_ are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and love, and all! Have you considered how you’ll bear the separation, and how he’ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss Catherine—”  “He quite deserted! we separated!” she exclaimed, with an accent of indignation. “Who is to separate us, pray? They’ll meet the fate of Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that’s not what I intend—that’s not what I mean! I shouldn’t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded! He’ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he learns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power.”  “With your husband’s money, Miss Catherine?” I asked. “You’ll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I’m hardly a judge, I think that’s the worst motive you’ve given yet for being the wife of young Linton.”  “It is not,” retorted she; “it is the best! The others were the satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar’s sake, too, to satisfy him. This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff’s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He’s always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don’t talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and—”  She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it forcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly!  “If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,” I said, “it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble me with no more secrets: I’ll not promise to keep them.”  “You’ll keep that?” she asked, eagerly.  “No, I’ll not promise,” I repeated.  She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn’t settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone.  “And how isn’t that nowt comed in fro’ th’ field, be this time? What is he about? girt idle seeght!” demanded the old man, looking round for Heathcliff.  “I’ll call him,” I replied. “He’s in the barn, I’ve no doubt.”  I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother’s conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They were “ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,” he affirmed. And on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour’s supplication before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!  “I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,” she said. “And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.”  Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming—“I wonder where he is—I wonder where he _can_ be! What did I say, Nelly? I’ve forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I’ve said to grieve him? I do wish he’d come. I do wish he would!”  “What a noise for nothing!” I cried, though rather uneasy myself. “What a trifle scares you! It’s surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I’ll engage he’s lurking there. See if I don’t ferret him out!”  I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and Joseph’s quest ended in the same.  “Yon lad gets war und war!” observed he on re-entering. “He’s left th’ gate at t’ full swing, and Miss’s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o’ corn, and plottered through, raight o’er into t’ meadow! Hahsomdiver, t’ maister ’ull play t’ devil to-morn, and he’ll do weel. He’s patience itsseln wi’ sich careless, offald craters—patience itsseln he is! Bud he’ll not be soa allus—yah’s see, all on ye! Yah mun’n’t drive him out of his heead for nowt!”  “Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?” interrupted Catherine. “Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?”  “I sud more likker look for th’ horse,” he replied. “It ’ud be to more sense. Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this—as black as t’ chimbley! und Heathcliff’s noan t’ chap to coom at _my_ whistle—happen he’ll be less hard o’ hearing wi’ _ye_!”  It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However, Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying.  About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous, though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed; excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands before it.  “Well, Miss!” I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; “you are not bent on getting your death, are you? Do you know what o’clock it is? Half-past twelve. Come, come to bed! there’s no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy: he’ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he’ll stay there now. He guesses we shouldn’t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he’d rather avoid having the door opened by the master.”  “Nay, nay, he’s noan at Gimmerton,” said Joseph. “I’s niver wonder but he’s at t’ bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn’t for nowt, and I wod hev’ ye to look out, Miss—yah muh be t’ next. Thank Hivin for all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro’ th’ rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t’ Scripture ses.” And he began quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them.  I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.  Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy.  “What ails you, Cathy?” he was saying when I entered: “you look as dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?”  “I’ve been wet,” she answered reluctantly, “and I’m cold, that’s all.”  “Oh, she is naughty!” I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably sober. “She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night through, and I couldn’t prevail on her to stir.”  Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. “The night through,” he repeated. “What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was over hours since.”  Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff’s absence, as long as we could conceal it; so I replied, I didn’t know how she took it into her head to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, “Ellen, shut the window. I’m starving!” And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers.  “She’s ill,” said Hindley, taking her wrist; “I suppose that’s the reason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don’t want to be troubled with more sickness here. What took you into the rain?”  “Running after t’ lads, as usuald!” croaked Joseph, catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. “If I war yah, maister, I’d just slam t’ boards i’ their faces all on ’em, gentle and simple! Never a day ut yah’re off, but yon cat o’ Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo’s a fine lass! shoo sits watching for ye i’ t’ kitchen; and as yah’re in at one door, he’s out at t’other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side! It’s bonny behaviour, lurking amang t’ fields, after twelve o’ t’ night, wi’ that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think _I’m_ blind; but I’m noan: nowt ut t’ soart!—I seed young Linton boath coming and going, and I seed _yah_” (directing his discourse to me), “yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th’ house, t’ minute yah heard t’ maister’s horse-fit clatter up t’ road.”  “Silence, eavesdropper!” cried Catherine; “none of your insolence before me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was _I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you were.”  “You lie, Cathy, no doubt,” answered her brother, “and you are a confounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not be afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business this very morning; and after he’s gone, I’d advise you all to look sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.”  “I never saw Heathcliff last night,” answered Catherine, beginning to sob bitterly: “and if you do turn him out of doors, I’ll go with him. But, perhaps, you’ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he’s gone.” Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were inarticulate.  Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn’t cry for nothing! I obliged her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage.  Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each other.  Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period, for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he _would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was rather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father’s death.  Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but Catherine’s tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go, and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to her husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then he has been a stranger: and it’s very queer to think it, but I’ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!  * * * * *   At this point of the housekeeper’s story she chanced to glance towards the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure half-past one. She would not hear of staying a second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself. And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.     CHAPTER X   A charming introduction to a hermit’s life! Four weeks’ torture, tossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!  Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse—the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is quite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes: I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years; and the heroine was married. I’ll ring: she’ll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.  “It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,” she commenced.  “Away, away with it!” I replied; “I desire to have—”  “The doctor says you must drop the powders.”  “With all my heart! Don’t interrupt me. Come and take your seat here. Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting out of your pocket—that will do—now continue the history of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he get a sizar’s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on the English highways?”  “He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I couldn’t give my word for any. I stated before that I didn’t know how he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your leave, I’ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?”  “Much.”  “That’s good news.”  * * * * *   I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to expect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who _can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.  It ended. Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one’s interest was not the chief consideration in the other’s thoughts. On a mellow evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me say,—“Nelly, is that you?”  It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. “Who can it be?” I thought. “Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no resemblance to his.”  “I have waited here an hour,” he resumed, while I continued staring; “and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I dared not enter. You do not know me? Look, I’m not a stranger!”  A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular. I remembered the eyes.  “What!” I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amazement. “What! you come back? Is it really you? Is it?”  “Yes, Heathcliff,” he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within. “Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you needn’t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word with her—your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to see her.”  “How will she take it?” I exclaimed. “What will she do? The surprise bewilders me—it will put her out of her head! And you _are_ Heathcliff! But altered! Nay, there’s no comprehending it. Have you been for a soldier?”  “Go and carry my message,” he interrupted, impatiently. “I’m in hell till you do!”  He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the door.  They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter, “A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma’am.”  “What does he want?” asked Mrs. Linton.  “I did not question him,” I answered.  “Well, close the curtains, Nelly,” she said; “and bring up tea. I’ll be back again directly.”  She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.  “Some one mistress does not expect,” I replied. “That Heathcliff—you recollect him, sir—who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw’s.”  “What! the gipsy—the ploughboy?” he cried. “Why did you not say so to Catherine?”  “Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,” I said. “She’d be sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off. I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.”  Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed quickly: “Don’t stand there, love! Bring the person in, if it be anyone particular.” Ere long, I heard the click of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have surmised an awful calamity.  “Oh, Edgar, Edgar!” she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. “Oh, Edgar darling! Heathcliff’s come back—he is!” And she tightened her embrace to a squeeze.  “Well, well,” cried her husband, crossly, “don’t strangle me for that! He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to be frantic!”  “I know you didn’t like him,” she answered, repressing a little the intensity of her delight. “Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now. Shall I tell him to come up?”  “Here,” he said, “into the parlour?”  “Where else?” she asked.  He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression—half angry, half laughing at his fastidiousness.  “No,” she added, after a while; “I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders. Will that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If so, give directions. I’ll run down and secure my guest. I’m afraid the joy is too great to be real!”  She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.  “_You_ bid him step up,” he said, addressing me; “and, Catherine, try to be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.”  I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently anticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the lady’s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then she seized Linton’s reluctant fingers and crushed them into his. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton’s; it looked intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master’s surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak.  “Sit down, sir,” he said, at length. “Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything occurs to please her.”  “And I also,” answered Heathcliff, “especially if it be anything in which I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.”  He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug, seized Heathcliff’s hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.  “I shall think it a dream to-morrow!” she cried. “I shall not be able to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more. And yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don’t deserve this welcome. To be absent and silent for three years, and never to think of me!”  “A little more than you have thought of me,” he murmured. “I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard below, I meditated this plan—just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you’ll not drive me off again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause. I’ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!”  “Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,” interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of politeness. “Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever he may lodge to-night; and I’m thirsty.”  She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room. The meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine’s cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he went to Gimmerton?  “No, to Wuthering Heights,” he answered: “Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I called this morning.”  Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away.  About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs. Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling me by the hair to rouse me.  “I cannot rest, Ellen,” she said, by way of apology. “And I want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky, because I’m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.”  “What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?” I answered. “As lads they had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised: it’s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between them.”  “But does it not show great weakness?” pursued she. “I’m not envious: I never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella’s yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same.”  “You’re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,” said I. “They humour you: I know what there would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you.”  “And then we shall fight to the death, sha’n’t we, Nelly?” she returned, laughing. “No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton’s love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn’t wish to retaliate.”  I advised her to value him the more for his affection.  “I do,” she answered, “but he needn’t resort to whining for trifles. It is childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone’s regard, and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I’m sure he behaved excellently!”  “What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?” I inquired. “He is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!”  “He explained it,” she replied. “I wonder as much as you. He said he called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living; and finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and, finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again in the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn’t trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother’s covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.”  “It’s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!” said I. “Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?”  “None for my friend,” she replied: “his strong head will keep him from danger; a little for Hindley: but he can’t be made morally worse than he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry rebellion against Providence. Oh, I’ve endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he’d be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I. However, it’s over, and I’ll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I’d not only turn the other, but I’d ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a proof, I’ll go make my peace with Edgar instantly. Good-night! I’m an angel!”  In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine’s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.  Heathcliff—Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future—used the liberty of visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also, deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected. He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling. My master’s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.  His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one’s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff’s disposition: to know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff’s deliberate designing.  We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day, when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast, complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine’s harshness which made her unhappy.  “How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?” cried the mistress, amazed at the unreasonable assertion. “You are surely losing your reason. When have I been harsh, tell me?”  “Yesterday,” sobbed Isabella, “and now!”  “Yesterday!” said her sister-in-law. “On what occasion?”  “In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!”  “And that’s your notion of harshness?” said Catherine, laughing. “It was no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn’t care whether you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff’s talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears.”  “Oh, no,” wept the young lady; “you wished me away, because you knew I liked to be there!”  “Is she sane?” asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. “I’ll repeat our conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for you.”  “I don’t mind the conversation,” she answered: “I wanted to be with—”  “Well?” said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.  “With him: and I won’t be always sent off!” she continued, kindling up. “You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but yourself!”  “You are an impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in surprise. “But I’ll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you can covet the admiration of Heathcliff—that you consider him an agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?”  “No, you have not,” said the infatuated girl. “I love him more than ever you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!”  “I wouldn’t be you for a kingdom, then!” Catherine declared, emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. “Nelly, help me to convince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone. I’d as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter’s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don’t imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior! He’s not a rough diamond—a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, ‘Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;’ I say, ‘Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be wronged:’ and he’d crush you like a sparrow’s egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn’t love a Linton; and yet he’d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There’s my picture: and I’m his friend—so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his trap.”  Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.  “For shame! for shame!” she repeated, angrily. “You are worse than twenty foes, you poisonous friend!”  “Ah! you won’t believe me, then?” said Catherine. “You think I speak from wicked selfishness?”  “I’m certain you do,” retorted Isabella; “and I shudder at you!”  “Good!” cried the other. “Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.”—  “And I must suffer for her egotism!” she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room. “All, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn’t she? Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?”  “Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,” I said. “He’s a bird of bad omen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can’t contradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is. Honest people don’t hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has he got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came. They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago—it was Joseph who told me—I met him at Gimmerton: ‘Nelly,’ he said, ‘we’s hae a crowner’s ’quest enow, at ahr folks’. One on ’em ’s a’most getten his finger cut off wi’ hauding t’ other fro’ stickin’ hisseln loike a cawlf. That’s maister, yah knaw, ’at ’s soa up o’ going tuh t’ grand ’sizes. He’s noan feared o’ t’ bench o’ judges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on ’em, not he! He fair likes—he langs to set his brazened face agean ’em! And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he’s a rare ’un. He can girn a laugh as well ’s onybody at a raight divil’s jest. Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t’ Grange? This is t’ way on ’t:—up at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und can’le-light till next day at noon: then, t’ fooil gangs banning un raving to his cham’er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i’ thur lugs fur varry shame; un’ the knave, why he can caint his brass, un’ ate, un’ sleep, un’ off to his neighbour’s to gossip wi’ t’ wife. I’ course, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur’s goold runs into his pocket, and her fathur’s son gallops down t’ broad road, while he flees afore to oppen t’ pikes!’ Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff’s conduct be true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?”  “You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!” she replied. “I’ll not listen to your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world!”  Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to _her_. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips. Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have done had it been practicable.  “Come in, that’s right!” exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair to the fire. “Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose. Heathcliff, I’m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it’s not Nelly; don’t look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in your own power to be Edgar’s brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha’n’t run off,” she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. “We were quarrelling like cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal oblivion!”  “Catherine!” said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her, “I’d thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.”  As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.  “By no means!” cried Mrs. Linton in answer. “I won’t be named a dog in the manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don’t you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I’m sure she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday’s walk, from sorrow and rage that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable.”  “I think you belie her,” said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face them. “She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!”  And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance, which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises. The poor thing couldn’t bear that; she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer’s with crescents of red.  “There’s a tigress!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and shaking her hand with pain. “Begone, for God’s sake, and hide your vixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_. Can’t you fancy the conclusions he’ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will do execution—you must beware of your eyes.”  “I’d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,” he answered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. “But what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not speaking the truth, were you?”  “I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been dying for your sake several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don’t notice it further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that’s all. I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.”  “And I like her too ill to attempt it,” said he, “except in a very ghoulish fashion. You’d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two: they detestably resemble Linton’s.”  “Delectably!” observed Catherine. “They are dove’s eyes—angel’s!”  “She’s her brother’s heir, is she not?” he asked, after a brief silence.  “I should be sorry to think so,” returned his companion. “Half a dozen nephews shall erase her title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour’s goods; remember _this_ neighbour’s goods are mine.”  “If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,” said Heathcliff; “but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we’ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.”  From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of the evening. I saw him smile to himself—grin rather—and lapse into ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment.  I determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the master’s, in preference to Catherine’s side: with reason I imagined, for he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she—she could not be called the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His visits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and destroy.     CHAPTER XI   Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I’ve got up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm. I’ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways; and then I’ve recollected his confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.  One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all at once a gush of child’s sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. “Poor Hindley!” I exclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought—or should die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.  “God bless thee, darling!” I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears. “Hareton, it’s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.”  He retreated out of arm’s length, and picked up a large flint.  “I am come to see thy father, Hareton,” I added, guessing from the action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised as one with me.  He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed another, keeping it out of his reach.  “Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?” I inquired. “The curate?”  “Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,” he replied.  “Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,” said I. “Who’s your master?”  “Devil daddy,” was his answer.  “And what do you learn from daddy?” I continued.  He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. “What does he teach you?” I asked.  “Naught,” said he, “but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me, because I swear at him.”  “Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?” I observed.  “Ay—nay,” he drawled.  “Who, then?”  “Heathcliff.”  “I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.”  “Ay!” he answered again.  Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the sentences—“I known’t: he pays dad back what he gies to me—he curses daddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.”  “And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?” I pursued.  “No, I was told the curate should have his —— teeth dashed down his —— throat, if he stepped over the threshold—Heathcliff had promised that!”  I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella’s affair: except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton’s pleasure.  The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.  “Judas! Traitor!” I ejaculated. “You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A deliberate deceiver.”  “Who is, Nelly?” said Catherine’s voice at my elbow: I had been over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.  “Your worthless friend!” I answered, warmly: “the sneaking rascal yonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us—he is coming in! I wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when he told you he hated her?”  Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn’t withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.  “To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!” she cried. “You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you about, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!—I beg you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the bolts against you!”  “God forbid that he should try!” answered the black villain. I detested him just then. “God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder after sending him to heaven!”  “Hush!” said Catherine, shutting the inner door. “Don’t vex me. Why have you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?”  “What is it to you?” he growled. “I have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband: _you_ needn’t be jealous of me!”  “I’m not jealous of you,” replied the mistress; “I’m jealous for you. Clear your face: you sha’n’t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you shall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff! There, you won’t answer. I’m certain you don’t.”  “And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?” I inquired.  “Mr. Linton should approve,” returned my lady, decisively.  “He might spare himself the trouble,” said Heathcliff: “I could do as well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I _know_ you have treated me infernally—infernally! Do you hear? And if you flatter yourself that I don’t perceive it, you are a fool; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you fancy I’ll suffer unrevenged, I’ll convince you of the contrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law’s secret: I swear I’ll make the most of it. And stand you aside!”  “What new phase of his character is this?” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in amazement. “I’ve treated you infernally—and you’ll take your revenge! How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you infernally?”  “I seek no revenge on you,” replied Heathcliff, less vehemently. “That’s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don’t turn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able. Having levelled my palace, don’t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you really wished me to marry Isabel, I’d cut my throat!”  “Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?” cried Catherine. “Well, I won’t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You prove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you’ll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.”  The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could neither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.  “Ellen,” said he, when I entered, “have you seen your mistress?”  “Yes; she’s in the kitchen, sir,” I answered. “She’s sadly put out by Mr. Heathcliff’s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it’s time to arrange his visits on another footing. There’s harm in being too soft, and now it’s come to this—.” And I related the scene in the court, and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame.  “This is insufferable!” he exclaimed. “It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian—I have humoured her enough.”  He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed, abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.  “How is this?” said Linton, addressing her; “what notion of propriety must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!”  “Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?” asked the mistress, in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton’s attention to him. He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.  “I’ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,” he said quietly; “not that I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance, I acquiesced—foolishly. Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure. Three minutes’ delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.”  Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision.  “Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!” he said. “It is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton, I’m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!”  My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.  “Fair means!” she said, in answer to her husband’s look of angry surprise. “If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess. No, I’ll swallow the key before you shall get it! I’m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant indulgence of one’s weak nature, and the other’s bad one, I earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for daring to think an evil thought of me!”  It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine’s grasp, and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale. For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his face.  “Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton. “We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice. Cheer up! you sha’n’t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb, it’s a sucking leveret.”  “I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!” said her friend. “I compliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I’d kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?”  The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push. He’d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front entrance.  “There! you’ve done with coming here,” cried Catherine. “Get away, now; he’ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he did overhear us, of course he’d never forgive you. You’ve played me an ill turn, Heathcliff! But go—make haste! I’d rather see Edgar at bay than you.”  “Do you suppose I’m going with that blow burning in my gullet?” he thundered. “By hell, no! I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut before I cross the threshold! If I don’t floor him now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!”  “He is not coming,” I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. “There’s the coachman and the two gardeners; you’ll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.”  The gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them. They had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in.  Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs. She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance.  “I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!” she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa. “A thousand smiths’ hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I’m in danger of being seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed me shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings; I’m certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him to turn listener? Heathcliff’s talk was outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing. Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool’s craving to hear evil of self, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care hardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend—if Edgar will be mean and jealous, I’ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own. That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity! But it’s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I’d not take Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.”  The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt, rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish to “frighten” her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together. He began to speak first.  “Remain where you are, Catherine,” he said; without any anger in his voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. “I shall not stay. I am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn whether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue your intimacy with—”  “Oh, for mercy’s sake,” interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, “for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.”  “To get rid of me, answer my question,” persevered Mr. Linton. “You _must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely _require_ to know which you choose.”  “I require to be let alone!” exclaimed Catherine, furiously. “I demand it! Don’t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you—you leave me!”  She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages! There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death. Linton looked terrified.  “There is nothing in the world the matter,” I whispered. I did not want him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.  “She has blood on her lips!” he said, shuddering.  “Never mind!” I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up—her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.  As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask whether she would have some carried up. “No!” she replied, peremptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife’s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour’s interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for Heathcliff’s advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.     CHAPTER XII   While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened—wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation—and _she_ fasted pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady’s name, since he might not hear her voice. I determined they should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.  Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar’s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. She ate and drank eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning. “Oh, I will die,” she exclaimed, “since no one cares anything about me. I wish I had not taken that.” Then a good while after I heard her murmur, “No, I’ll not die—he’d be glad—he does not love me at all—he would never miss me!”  “Did you want anything, ma’am?” I inquired, still preserving my external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated manner.  “What is that apathetic being doing?” she demanded, pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face. “Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he dead?”  “Neither,” replied I; “if you mean Mr. Linton. He’s tolerably well, I think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is continually among his books, since he has no other society.”  I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.  “Among his books!” she cried, confounded. “And I dying! I on the brink of the grave! My God! does he know how I’m altered?” continued she, staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall. “Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet—in play, perhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I’ll choose between these two: either to starve at once—that would be no punishment unless he had a heart—or to recover, and leave the country. Are you speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life?”  “Why, ma’am,” I answered, “the master has no idea of your being deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.”  “You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?” she returned. “Persuade him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!”  “No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,” I suggested, “that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good effects.”  “If I were only sure it would kill him,” she interrupted, “I’d kill myself directly! These three awful nights I’ve never closed my lids—and oh, I’ve been tormented! I’ve been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy you don’t like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and despised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all turned to enemies in a few hours. _They_ have, I’m positive; the people _here_. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces! Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be so dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to his house, and going back to his _books_! What in the name of all that feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?”  She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr. Linton’s philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth; then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the window. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the north-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor’s injunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.  “That’s a turkey’s,” she murmured to herself; “and this is a wild duck’s; and this is a pigeon’s. Ah, they put pigeons’ feathers in the pillows—no wonder I couldn’t die! Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock’s; and this—I should know it among a thousand—it’s a lapwing’s. Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he’d never shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn’t. Yes, here are more! Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.”  “Give over with that baby-work!” I interrupted, dragging the pillow away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its contents by handfuls. “Lie down and shut your eyes: you’re wandering. There’s a mess! The down is flying about like snow.”  I went here and there collecting it.  “I see in you, Nelly,” she continued dreamily, “an aged woman: you have grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That’s what you’ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I’m not wandering: you’re mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone Crags; and I’m conscious it’s night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet.”  “The black press? where is that?” I asked. “You are talking in your sleep!”  “It’s against the wall, as it always is,” she replied. “It _does_ appear odd—I see a face in it!”  “There’s no press in the room, and never was,” said I, resuming my seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.  “Don’t _you_ see that face?” she inquired, gazing earnestly at the mirror.  And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.  “It’s behind there still!” she pursued, anxiously. “And it stirred. Who is it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the room is haunted! I’m afraid of being alone!”  I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze towards the glass.  “There’s nobody here!” I insisted. “It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since.”  “Myself!” she gasped, “and the clock is striking twelve! It’s true, then! that’s dreadful!”  Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek—the shawl had dropped from the frame.  “Why, what _is_ the matter?” cried I. “Who is coward now? Wake up! That is the glass—the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and there am I too by your side.”  Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.  “Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,” she sighed. “I thought I was lying in my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I’m weak, my brain got confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don’t say anything; but stay with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.”  “A sound sleep would do you good, ma’am,” I answered: “and I hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again.”  “Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!” she went on bitterly, wringing her hands. “And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice. Do let me feel it—it comes straight down the moor—do let me have one breath!”  To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.  “How long is it since I shut myself in here?” she asked, suddenly reviving.  “It was Monday evening,” I replied, “and this is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning, at present.”  “What! of the same week?” she exclaimed. “Only that brief time?”  “Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,” observed I.  “Well, it seems a weary number of hours,” she muttered doubtfully: “it must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn’t explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I’ll tell you what I thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I’m burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I’m sure I should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the window again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don’t you move?”  “Because I won’t give you your death of cold,” I answered.  “You won’t give me a chance of life, you mean,” she said sullenly. “However, I’m not helpless yet; I’ll open it myself.”  And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I entreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious, I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and those at Wuthering Heights were never visible—still she asserted she caught their shining.  “Look!” she cried eagerly, “that’s my room with the candle in it, and the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph’s garret. Joseph sits up late, doesn’t he? He’s waiting till I come home that he may lock the gate. Well, he’ll wait a while yet. It’s a rough journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that journey! We’ve braved its ghosts often together, and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I’ll keep you. I’ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the church down over me, but I won’t rest till you are with me. I never will!”  She paused, and resumed with a strange smile. “He’s considering—he’d rather I’d come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard. You are slow! Be content, you always followed me!”  Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.  “Oh, sir!” I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. “My poor mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all; pray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she’s hard to guide any way but her own.”  “Catherine ill?” he said, hastening to us. “Shut the window, Ellen! Catherine! why—”  He was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton’s appearance smote him speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment.  “She’s been fretting here,” I continued, “and eating scarcely anything, and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and so we couldn’t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it ourselves; but it is nothing.”  I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. “It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?” he said sternly. “You shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!” And he took his wife in his arms, and looked at her with anguish.  At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.  “Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?” she said, with angry animation. “You are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now—I see we shall—but they can’t keep me from my narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I’m bound before spring is over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me!”  “Catherine, what have you done?” commenced the master. “Am I nothing to you any more? Do you love that wretch Heath—”  “Hush!” cried Mrs. Linton. “Hush, this moment! You mention that name and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top before you lay hands on me again. I don’t want you, Edgar: I’m past wanting you. Return to your books. I’m glad you possess a consolation, for all you had in me is gone.”  “Her mind wanders, sir,” I interposed. “She has been talking nonsense the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and she’ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.”  “I desire no further advice from you,” answered Mr. Linton. “You knew your mistress’s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was heartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!”  I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another’s wicked waywardness. “I knew Mrs. Linton’s nature to be headstrong and domineering,” cried I: “but I didn’t know that you wished to foster her fierce temper! I didn’t know that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant’s wages! Well, it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!”  “The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen Dean,” he replied.  “You’d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?” said I. “Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison the mistress against you?”  Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our conversation.  “Ah! Nelly has played traitor,” she exclaimed, passionately. “Nelly is my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me go, and I’ll make her rue! I’ll make her howl a recantation!”  A maniac’s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to disengage herself from Linton’s arms. I felt no inclination to tarry the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I quitted the chamber.  In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world. My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so. While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses’ feet galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o’clock in the morning.  Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine Linton’s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately. He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before.  “Nelly Dean,” said he, “I can’t help fancying there’s an extra cause for this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We’ve odd reports up here. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a trifle; and that sort of people should not either. It’s hard work bringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?”  “The master will inform you,” I answered; “but you are acquainted with the Earnshaws’ violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I may say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit. That’s her account, at least: for she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up. Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.”  “Mr. Linton will be sorry?” observed Kenneth, interrogatively.  “Sorry? he’ll break his heart should anything happen!” I replied. “Don’t alarm him more than necessary.”  “Well, I told him to beware,” said my companion; “and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn’t he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff lately?”  “Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,” answered I, “though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because the master likes his company. At present he’s discharged from the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he’ll be taken in again.”  “And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?” was the doctor’s next question.  “I’m not in her confidence,” returned I, reluctant to continue the subject.  “No, she’s a sly one,” he remarked, shaking his head. “She keeps her own counsel! But she’s a real little fool. I have it from good authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was to be he didn’t hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!”  This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On ascending to Isabella’s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton’s illness might have arrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not pursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay in a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features.  The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he signified the threatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.  I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: “Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master, master, our young lady—”  “Hold your noise!” cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.  “Speak lower, Mary—What is the matter?” said Mr. Linton. “What ails your young lady?”  “She’s gone, she’s gone! Yon’ Heathcliff’s run off wi’ her!” gasped the girl.  “That is not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. “It cannot be: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It is incredible: it cannot be.”  As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.  “Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,” she stammered, “and he asked whether we weren’t in trouble at the Grange. I thought he meant for missis’s sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, ‘There’s somebody gone after ’em, I guess?’ I stared. He saw I knew nought about it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse’s shoe fastened at a blacksmith’s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith’s lass had got up to spy who they were: she knew them both directly. And she noticed the man—Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob’dy could mistake him, besides—put a sovereign in her father’s hand for payment. The lady had a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and went as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.”  I ran and peeped, for form’s sake, into Isabella’s room; confirming, when I returned, the servant’s statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a word.  “Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,” I inquired. “How should we do?”  “She went of her own accord,” answered the master; “she had a right to go if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only my sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me.”  And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I knew it.     CHAPTER XIII   For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs. Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety—in fact, that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity—he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine’s life was declared out of danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.  The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.  “These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,” she exclaimed. “They remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow. Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?”  “The snow is quite gone down here, darling,” replied her husband; “and I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.”  “I shall never be there but once more,” said the invalid; “and then you’ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you’ll long again to have me under this roof, and you’ll look back and think you were happy to-day.”  Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to light a fire in the many-weeks’ deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present—on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar’s arm. Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. And there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton’s heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger’s gripe, by the birth of an heir.  I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon. I’ll read it: for I keep it yet. Any relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.  * * * * *   DEAR ELLEN, it begins,—I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write to somebody, and the only choice left me is you.  Inform Edgar that I’d give the world to see his face again—that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine! _I can’t follow it though_—(these words are underlined)—they need not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection.  The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you two questions: the first is,—How did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.  The second question I have great interest in; it is this—Is Mr. Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I sha’n’t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don’t write, but come, and bring me something from Edgar.  Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and the rest was an unnatural dream!  The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I judged it to be six o’clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn away. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables; reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in an ancient castle.  Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen—a dingy, untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it was in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his mouth.  “This is Edgar’s legal nephew,” I reflected—“mine in a manner; I must shake hands, and—yes—I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning.”  I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said—“How do you do, my dear?”  He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.  “Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?” was my next essay at conversation.  An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not “frame off” rewarded my perseverance.  “Hey, Throttler, lad!” whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred bull-dog from its lair in a corner. “Now, wilt thou be ganging?” he asked authoritatively.  Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and replied—“Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it? Mincing un’ munching! How can I tell whet ye say?”  “I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!” I cried, thinking him deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.  “None o’ me! I getten summut else to do,” he answered, and continued his work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I’m sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.  I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine’s with all their beauty annihilated.  “What’s your business here?” he demanded, grimly. “Who are you?”  “My name _was_ Isabella Linton,” I replied. “You’ve seen me before, sir. I’m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here—I suppose by your permission.”  “Is he come back, then?” asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.  “Yes—we came just now,” I said; “but he left me by the kitchen door; and when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.”  “It’s well the hellish villain has kept his word!” growled my future host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he would have done had the “fiend” deceived him.  I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him again.  You’ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless, seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass them! I questioned with myself—where must I turn for comfort? and—mind you don’t tell Edgar, or Catherine—above every sorrow beside, this rose pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear their intermeddling.  I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals. I listened to detect a woman’s voice in the house, and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I was not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise. Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed—“I’m tired with my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant? Direct me to her, as she won’t come to me!”  “We have none,” he answered; “you must wait on yourself!”  “Where must I sleep, then?” I sobbed; I was beyond regarding self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.  “Joseph will show you Heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that door—he’s in there.”  I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the strangest tone—“Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your bolt—don’t omit it!”  “Well!” I said. “But why, Mr. Earnshaw?” I did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.  “Look here!” he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached to the barrel. “That’s a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door. If once I find it open he’s done for; I do it invariably, even though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long as you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!”  I surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how powerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his hand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was covetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife, and returned it to its concealment.  “I don’t care if you tell him,” said he. “Put him on his guard, and watch for him. You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not shock you.”  “What has Heathcliff done to you?” I asked. “In what has he wronged you, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn’t it be wiser to bid him quit the house?”  “No!” thundered Earnshaw; “should he offer to leave me, he’s a dead man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose _all_, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh, damnation! I _will_ have it back; and I’ll have _his_ gold too; and then his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before!”  You’ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master’s habits. He is clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant’s ill-bred moroseness as comparatively agreeable. He now recommenced his moody walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, “_I’ll_ make the porridge!” I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. “Mr. Earnshaw,” I continued, “directs me to wait on myself: I will. I’m not going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.”  “Gooid Lord!” he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle. “If there’s to be fresh ortherings—just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev’ a _mistress_ set o’er my heead, it’s like time to be flitting. I niver _did_ think to see t’ day that I mud lave th’ owld place—but I doubt it’s nigh at hand!”  This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation.  “Thear!” he ejaculated. “Hareton, thou willn’t sup thy porridge to-neeght; they’ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear, agean! I’d fling in bowl un’ all, if I wer ye! There, pale t’ guilp off, un’ then ye’ll hae done wi’t. Bang, bang. It’s a mercy t’ bothom isn’t deaved out!”  It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me, repeatedly, that “the barn was every bit as good” as I, “and every bit as wollsome,” and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited. Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.  “I shall have my supper in another room,” I said. “Have you no place you call a parlour?”  “_Parlour_!” he echoed, sneeringly, “_parlour_! Nay, we’ve noa _parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there’s maister’s; un’ if yah dunnut loike maister, there’s us.”  “Then I shall go upstairs,” I answered; “show me a chamber.”  I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the apartments we passed.  “Here’s a rahm,” he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on hinges. “It’s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There’s a pack o’ corn i’ t’ corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye’re feared o’ muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o’ t’ top on’t.”  The “rahm” was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain; various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare space in the middle.  “Why, man,” I exclaimed, facing him angrily, “this is not a place to sleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.”  “_Bed-rume_!” he repeated, in a tone of mockery. “Yah’s see all t’ _bed-rumes_ thear is—yon’s mine.”  He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.  “What do I want with yours?” I retorted. “I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house, does he?”  “Oh! it’s Maister _Hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, as if making a new discovery. “Couldn’t ye ha’ said soa, at onst? un’ then, I mud ha’ telled ye, baht all this wark, that that’s just one ye cannut see—he allas keeps it locked, un’ nob’dy iver mells on’t but hisseln.”  “You’ve a nice house, Joseph,” I could not refrain from observing, “and pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose—there are other rooms. For heaven’s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!”  He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one. There was a carpet—a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession, when my fool of a guide announced,—“This here is t’ maister’s.” My supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience exhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge, and means of repose.  “Whear the divil?” began the religious elder. “The Lord bless us! The Lord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome nowt! Ye’ve seen all but Hareton’s bit of a cham’er. There’s not another hoile to lig down in i’ th’ hahse!”  I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then seated myself at the stairs’-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.  “Ech! ech!” exclaimed Joseph. “Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss Cathy! Howsiver, t’ maister sall just tum’le o’er them brocken pots; un’ then we’s hear summut; we’s hear how it’s to be. Gooid-for-naught madling! ye desarve pining fro’ this to Churstmas, flinging t’ precious gifts uh God under fooit i’ yer flaysome rages! But I’m mista’en if ye shew yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I nobbut wish he may catch ye i’ that plisky. I nobbut wish he may.”  And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects. An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw’s tread in the passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway. The dog’s endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton’s room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,—“They’s rahm for boath ye un’ yer pride, now, I sud think i’ the hahse. It’s empty; ye may hev’ it all to yerseln, un’ Him as allas maks a third, i’ sich ill company!”  Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was deep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing there? I told him the cause of my staying up so late—that he had the key of our room in his pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence. He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he’d—but I’ll not repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens. He told me of Catherine’s illness, and accused my brother of causing it; promising that I should be Edgar’s proxy in suffering, till he could get hold of him.  I do hate him—I am wretched—I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every day—don’t disappoint me!—ISABELLA.     CHAPTER XIV   As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton’s situation, and her ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.  “Forgiveness!” said Linton. “I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I am not _angry_, but I’m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can never think she’ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see her, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.”  “And you won’t write her a little note, sir?” I asked, imploringly.  “No,” he answered. “It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff’s family shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!”  Mr. Edgar’s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess, that if I had been in the young lady’s place, I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there. Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn’t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manœuvres, and said—“If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her. You needn’t make a secret of it: we have no secrets between us.”  “Oh, I have nothing,” I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at once. “My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma’am, and his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of keeping it up.”  Mrs. Heathcliff’s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as I thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton’s example and avoid future interference with his family, for good or evil.  “Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,” I said; “she’ll never be like she was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her, you’ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you’ll move out of this country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I’ll inform you Catherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense of duty!”  “That is quite possible,” remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem calm: “quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this house, I must exact a promise from you that you’ll get me an interview with her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her! What do you say?”  “I say, Mr. Heathcliff,” I replied, “you must not: you never shall, through my means. Another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether.”  “With your aid that may be avoided,” he continued; “and should there be danger of such an event—should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existence—why, I think I shall be justified in going to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against him. You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood! But, till then—if you don’t believe me, you don’t know me—till then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!”  “And yet,” I interrupted, “you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress.”  “You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?” he said. “Oh, Nelly! you know she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words would comprehend my future—_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton’s attachment more than mine. If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn’t love as much in eighty years as I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him what he has not?”  “Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,” cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. “No one has a right to talk in that manner, and I won’t hear my brother depreciated in silence!”  “Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn’t he?” observed Heathcliff, scornfully. “He turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.”  “He is not aware of what I suffer,” she replied. “I didn’t tell him that.”  “You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?”  “To say that I was married, I did write—you saw the note.”  “And nothing since?”  “No.”  “My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,” I remarked. “Somebody’s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn’t say.”  “I should guess it was her own,” said Heathcliff. “She degenerates into a mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early. You’d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home. However, she’ll suit this house so much the better for not being over nice, and I’ll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.”  “Well, sir,” returned I, “I hope you’ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve. You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must treat her kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn’t have abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.”  “She abandoned them under a delusion,” he answered; “picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at last, I think she begins to know me: I don’t perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons could teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually succeeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I assure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you alone for half a day, won’t you come sighing and wheedling to me again? I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don’t care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for herself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury! Now, was it not the depth of absurdity—of genuine idiocy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her? Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I’ve sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation; and, what’s more, she’d thank nobody for dividing us. If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!”  “Mr. Heathcliff,” said I, “this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she’ll doubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched, ma’am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?”  “Take care, Ellen!” answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner’s endeavours to make himself detested. “Don’t put faith in a single word he speaks. He’s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human being! I’ve been told I might leave him before; and I’ve made the attempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you’ll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha’n’t obtain it—I’ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!”  “There—that will do for the present!” said Heathcliff. “If you are called upon in a court of law, you’ll remember her language, Nelly! And take a good look at that countenance: she’s near the point which would suit me. No; you’re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however distasteful the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean in private. That’s not the way: upstairs, I tell you! Why, this is the road upstairs, child!”  He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering—“I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.”  “Do you understand what the word pity means?” I said, hastening to resume my bonnet. “Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?”  “Put that down!” he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart. “You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don’t desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last night I was in the Grange garden six hours, and I’ll return there to-night; and every night I’ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I stay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols. But wouldn’t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I’d warn you when I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering mischief.”  I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer’s house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs. Linton’s tranquillity for his satisfaction. “The commonest occurrence startles her painfully,” I said. “She’s all nerves, and she couldn’t bear the surprise, I’m positive. Don’t persist, sir! or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he’ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!”  “In that case I’ll take measures to secure you, woman!” exclaimed Heathcliff; “you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow morning. It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me; and as to surprising her, I don’t desire it: you must prepare her—ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name, and that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for her husband. Oh, I’ve no doubt she’s in hell among you! I guess by her silence, as much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You talk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending her from _duty_ and _humanity_! From _pity_ and _charity_! He might as well plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares! Let us settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over Linton and his footman? Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no reason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!”  Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. I engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton’s next absence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn’t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I thought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine’s mental illness: and then I remembered Mr. Edgar’s stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation, should be the last. Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton’s hand.  But here is Kenneth; I’ll go down, and tell him how much better you are. My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another morning.  * * * * *   Dree, and dreary! I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse me. But never mind! I’ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean’s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff’s brilliant eyes. I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.     CHAPTER XV   Another week over—and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I have now heard all my neighbour’s history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I’ll continue it in her own words, only a little condensed. She is, on the whole, a very fair narrator, and I don’t think I could improve her style.  * * * * *   In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn’t want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to church. There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went upstairs.  Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her thick, long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck. Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond—you would have said out of this world. Then, the paleness of her face—its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh—and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened; and—invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should think—refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.  A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses. At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.  Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye.  “There’s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,” I said, gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee. “You must read it immediately, because it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?” “Yes,” she answered, without altering the direction of her eyes. I opened it—it was very short. “Now,” I continued, “read it.” She drew away her hand, and let it fall. I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at last I resumed—“Must I read it, ma’am? It is from Mr. Heathcliff.”  There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to arrange her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness.  “Well, he wishes to see you,” said I, guessing her need of an interpreter. “He’s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know what answer I shall bring.”  As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly. The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber. He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.  He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face! The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there—she was fated, sure to die.  “Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?” was the first sentence he uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now he stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did not melt.  “What now?” said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices. “You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me—and thriven on it, I think. How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?”  Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise, but she seized his hair, and kept him down.  “I wish I could hold you,” she continued, bitterly, “till we were both dead! I shouldn’t care what you suffered. I care nothing for your sufferings. Why shouldn’t you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence, ‘That’s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is past. I’ve loved many others since: my children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave them!’ Will you say so, Heathcliff?”  “Don’t torture me till I’m as mad as yourself,” cried he, wrenching his head free, and grinding his teeth.  The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. Her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.  “Are you possessed with a devil,” he pursued, savagely, “to talk in that manner to me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?”  “I shall not be at peace,” moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more kindly—  “I’m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own sake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember than my harsh words! Won’t you come here again? Do!”  Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent round to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us. Mrs. Linton’s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:—  “Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave. _That_ is how I’m loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_ Heathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he’s in my soul. And,” added she musingly, “the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all. I’m tired of being enclosed here. I’m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you think you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are sorry for me—very soon that will be altered. I shall be sorry for _you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I _wonder_ he won’t be near me!” She went on to herself. “I thought he wished it. Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to me, Heathcliff.”  In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.  A movement of Catherine’s relieved me a little presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly—  “You teach me now how cruel you’ve been—cruel and false. _Why_ did you despise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they’ll blight you—they’ll damn you. You loved me—then what _right_ had you to leave me? What right—answer me—for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart—_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you—oh, God! would _you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?”  “Let me alone. Let me alone,” sobbed Catherine. “If I’ve done wrong, I’m dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won’t upbraid you! I forgive you. Forgive me!”  “It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands,” he answered. “Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer—but _yours_! How can I?”  They were silent—their faces hid against each other, and washed by each other’s tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it seemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.  I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away, the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.  “Service is over,” I announced. “My master will be here in half an hour.”  Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never moved.  Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.  “Now he is here,” I exclaimed. “For heaven’s sake, hurry down! You’ll not meet any one on the front stairs. Do be quick; and stay among the trees till he is fairly in.”  “I must go, Cathy,” said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from his companion’s arms. “But if I live, I’ll see you again before you are asleep. I won’t stray five yards from your window.”  “You must not go!” she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength allowed. “You _shall_ not, I tell you.”  “For one hour,” he pleaded earnestly.  “Not for one minute,” she replied.  “I _must_—Linton will be up immediately,” persisted the alarmed intruder.  He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act—she clung fast, gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.  “No!” she shrieked. “Oh, don’t, don’t go. It is the last time! Edgar will not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!”  “Damn the fool! There he is,” cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his seat. “Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I’ll stay. If he shot me so, I’d expire with a blessing on my lips.”  And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the stairs—the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.  “Are you going to listen to her ravings?” I said, passionately. “She does not know what she says. Will you ruin her, because she has not wit to help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most diabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for—master, mistress, and servant.”  I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe that Catherine’s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down.  “She’s fainted, or dead,” I thought: “so much the better. Far better that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to all about her.”  Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage. What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his arms.  “Look there!” he said. “Unless you be a fiend, help her first—then you shall speak to me!”  He walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and moaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.  “I shall not refuse to go out of doors,” he answered; “but I shall stay in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall be under those larch-trees. Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be in or not.”  He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and, ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house of his luckless presence.     CHAPTER XVI   About twelve o’clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months’ child; and two hours after the mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter’s distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son’s. An unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life, and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be.  Next morning—bright and cheerful out of doors—stole softened in through the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow, and his eyes shut. His young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but _his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace. Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared. And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before: “Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth or now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!”  I don’t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter—the Eternity they have entered—where life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like Mr. Linton’s, when he so regretted Catherine’s blessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.  Do you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir? I’d give a great deal to know.  I declined answering Mrs. Dean’s question, which struck me as something heterodox. She proceeded:  Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to think she is; but we’ll leave her with her Maker.  The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had remained among the larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer doors, that all was not right within. I wished, yet feared, to find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but _how_ to do it I did not know. He was there—at least, a few yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:—“She’s dead!” he said; “I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away—don’t snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none of _your_ tears!”  I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I first looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground.  “Yes, she’s dead!” I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks. “Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!”  “Did _she_ take due warning, then?” asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer. “Did she die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the event. How did—?”  He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony, defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare. “How did she die?” he resumed, at last—fain, notwithstanding his hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.  “Poor wretch!” I thought; “you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride cannot blind God! You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of humiliation.”  “Quietly as a lamb!” I answered, aloud. “She drew a sigh, and stretched herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!”  “And—did she ever mention me?” he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear.  “Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you left her,” I said. “She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a gentle dream—may she wake as kindly in the other world!”  “May she wake in torment!” he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion. “Why, she’s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not _there_—not in heaven—not perished—where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my sufferings! And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue stiffens—Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered _do_ haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I _cannot_ live without my life! I _cannot_ live without my soul!”  He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night. It hardly moved my compassion—it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed. He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!  Mrs. Linton’s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room. Linton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and—a circumstance concealed from all but me—Heathcliff spent his nights, at least, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication with him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu. He did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise. Indeed, I shouldn’t have discovered that he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse’s face, and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine’s neck. Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own. I twisted the two, and enclosed them together.  Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants. Isabella was not asked.  The place of Catherine’s interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet by the tombs of her own relations, outside. It was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost buries it. Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the graves.     CHAPTER XVII   That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the maids, and I cried—“Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here? What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?”  “Excuse me!” answered a familiar voice; “but I know Edgar is in bed, and I cannot stop myself.”  With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her hand to her side.  “I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!” she continued, after a pause; “except where I’ve flown. I couldn’t count the number of falls I’ve had. Oh, I’m aching all over! Don’t be alarmed! There shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.”  The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her.  “My dear young lady,” I exclaimed, “I’ll stir nowhere, and hear nothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is needless to order the carriage.”  “Certainly I shall,” she said; “walking or riding: yet I’ve no objection to dress myself decently. And—ah, see how it flows down my neck now! The fire does make it smart.”  She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.  “Now, Ellen,” she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, “you sit down opposite me, and put poor Catherine’s baby away: I don’t like to see it! You mustn’t think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so foolishly on entering: I’ve cried, too, bitterly—yes, more than any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I sha’n’t forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise with him—the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker! This is the last thing of his I have about me:” she slipped the gold ring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. “I’ll smash it!” she continued, striking it with childish spite, “and then I’ll burn it!” and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals. “There! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again. He’d be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he? And I won’t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I’d have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed—of that incarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It’s a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn’t have run till I’d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!”  “Well, don’t talk so fast, Miss!” I interrupted; “you’ll disorder the handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again. Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!”  “An undeniable truth,” she replied. “Listen to that child! It maintains a constant wail—send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha’n’t stay any longer.”  I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant’s care; and then I inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining with us.  “I ought, and I wished to remain,” answered she, “to cheer Edgar and take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right home. But I tell you he wouldn’t let me! Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry—could bear to think that we were tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I’ve recovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I’d rather he’d kill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I’m at my ease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him, if—no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so well. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!”  “Hush, hush! He’s a human being,” I said. “Be more charitable: there are worse men than he is yet!”  “He’s not a human being,” she retorted; “and he has no claim on my charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn’t!” And here Isabella began to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced. “You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.  “Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He kept himself sober for the purpose—tolerably sober: not going to bed mad at six o’clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.  “Heathcliff—I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house from last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his chamber; locking himself in—as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding these precious orisons—and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat—he would be off again; always straight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him into custody! For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.  “I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph’s eternal lectures without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn’t think that I should cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable companions. I’d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than with ‘t’ little maister’ and his staunch supporter, that odious old man! When Heathcliff is in, I’m often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he’s sure he’s an altered man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ‘so as by fire.’ I’m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.  “Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place. Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on the same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to be restored.  “The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual; owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and we heard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.  “‘I’ll keep him out five minutes,’ he exclaimed. ‘You won’t object?’  “‘No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,’ I answered. ‘Do! put the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.’  “Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he couldn’t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.  “‘You, and I,’ he said, ‘have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to discharge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?’  “‘I’m weary of enduring now,’ I replied; ‘and I’d be glad of a retaliation that wouldn’t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies.’  “‘Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!’ cried Hindley. ‘Mrs. Heathcliff, I’ll ask you to do nothing; but sit still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I’m sure you would have as much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend’s existence; he’ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he’ll be _my_ ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he were master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock strikes—it wants three minutes of one—you’re a free woman!’  “He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his breast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away, however, and seized his arm.  “‘I’ll not hold my tongue!’ I said; ‘you mustn’t touch him. Let the door remain shut, and be quiet!’  “‘No! I’ve formed my resolution, and by God I’ll execute it!’ cried the desperate being. ‘I’ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and Hareton justice! And you needn’t trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I cut my throat this minute—and it’s time to make an end!’  “I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him.  “‘You’d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!’ I exclaimed, in rather a triumphant tone. ‘Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you persist in endeavouring to enter.’  “‘You’d better open the door, you—’ he answered, addressing me by some elegant term that I don’t care to repeat.  “‘I shall not meddle in the matter,’ I retorted again. ‘Come in and get shot, if you please. I’ve done my duty.’  “With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing for _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.  “‘Isabella, let me in, or I’ll make you repent!’ he ‘girned,’ as Joseph calls it.  “‘I cannot commit murder,’ I replied. ‘Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol.’  “‘Let me in by the kitchen door,’ he said.  “‘Hindley will be there before me,’ I answered: ‘and that’s a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you, I’d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The world is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly impressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can’t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.’  “‘He’s there, is he?’ exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. ‘If I can get my arm out I can hit him!’  “I’m afraid, Ellen, you’ll set me down as really wicked; but you don’t know all, so don’t judge. I wouldn’t have aided or abetted an attempt on even _his_ life for anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw’s weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.  “The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its owner’s wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang in. His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw’s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once.  “‘What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?’  “‘There’s this to do,’ thundered Heathcliff, ‘that your master’s mad; and should he last another month, I’ll have him to an asylum. And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don’t stand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I’m not going to nurse him. Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle—it is more than half brandy!’  “‘And so ye’ve been murthering on him?’ exclaimed Joseph, lifting his hands and eyes in horror. ‘If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the Lord—’  “Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood, and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows.  “‘Oh, I forgot you,’ said the tyrant. ‘You shall do that. Down with you. And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper? There, that is work fit for you!’  “He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. He was so obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.  “This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw’s seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.  “Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have covered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his_ case, I was gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn’t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.”  “Fie, fie, Miss!” I interrupted. “One might suppose you had never opened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his!”  “In general I’ll allow that it would be, Ellen,” she continued; “but what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it? I’d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings and he might _know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much. On only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him the first to implore pardon; and then—why then, Ellen, I might show you some generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I handed him a glass, and asked him how he was.  “‘Not as ill as I wish,’ he replied. ‘But leaving out my arm, every inch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!’  “‘Yes, no wonder,’ was my next remark. ‘Catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her. It’s well people don’t _really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?’  “‘I can’t say,’ he answered; ‘but what do you mean? Did he dare to strike me when I was down?’  “‘He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,’ I whispered. ‘And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because he’s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.’  “Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him: the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features.  “‘Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony, I’d go to hell with joy,’ groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle.  “‘Nay, it’s enough that he has murdered one of you,’ I observed aloud. ‘At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be hated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were—how happy Catherine was before he came—I’m fit to curse the day.’  “Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.  “‘Get up, and begone out of my sight,’ said the mourner.  “I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was hardly intelligible.  “‘I beg your pardon,’ I replied. ‘But I loved Catherine too; and her brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now that she’s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and her—’  “‘Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!’ he cried, making a movement that caused me to make one also.  “‘But then,’ I continued, holding myself ready to flee, ‘if poor Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a similar picture! _She_ wouldn’t have borne your abominable behaviour quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.’  “The back of the settle and Earnshaw’s person interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.”  Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar’s and Catherine’s portraits, bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south, near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish creature.  Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she lived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment, only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information, he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of residence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn’t molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed: “They wish me to hate it too, do they?”  “I don’t think they wish you to know anything about it,” I answered.  “But I’ll have it,” he said, “when I want it. They may reckon on that!”  Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more.  On the day succeeding Isabella’s unexpected visit I had no opportunity of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for discussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long. _He_ didn’t pray for Catherine’s soul to haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was gone.  And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot’s sceptre in his heart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than from its being his own.  I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands, and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn’t both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped, and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them. But you’ll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you’ll judge, as well as I can, all these things: at least, you’ll think you will, and that’s the same. The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his sister’s: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my master.  “Well, Nelly,” said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, “it’s yours and my turn to go into mourning at present. Who’s given us the slip now, do you think?”  “Who?” I asked in a flurry.  “Why, guess!” he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door. “And nip up the corner of your apron: I’m certain you’ll need it.”  “Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?” I exclaimed.  “What! would you have tears for him?” said the doctor. “No, Heathcliff’s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I’ve just seen him. He’s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.”  “Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?” I repeated impatiently.  “Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,” he replied, “and my wicked gossip: though he’s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said we should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character: drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I’m sorry, too. One can’t help missing an old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He’s barely twenty-seven, it seems; that’s your own age: who would have thought you were born in one year?”  I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton’s death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder myself from pondering on the question—“Had he had fair play?” Whatever I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded him that the child Hareton was his wife’s nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go. His lawyer had been Earnshaw’s also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.  “His father died in debt,” he said; “the whole property is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor’s heart, that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him.”  When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral, if I chose.  “Correctly,” he remarked, “that fool’s body should be buried at the cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle: flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both dead and cold, and stark; and so you’ll allow it was useless making more stir about him!”  The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:  “I’d rayther he’d goan hisseln for t’ doctor! I sud ha’ taen tent o’ t’ maister better nor him—and he warn’t deead when I left, naught o’ t’ soart!”  I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, “Now, my bonny lad, you are _mine_! And we’ll see if one tree won’t grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!” The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech: he played with Heathcliff’s whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, “That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the world less yours than he is!”  “Does Linton say so?” he demanded.  “Of course—he has ordered me to take him,” I replied.  “Well,” said the scoundrel, “we’ll not argue the subject now: but I have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove it. I don’t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I’ll be pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.”  This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no more of interfering. I’m not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been ever so willing.  The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm possession, and proved to the attorney—who, in his turn, proved it to Mr. Linton—that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father’s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been wronged.     CHAPTER XVIII   The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little lady’s trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest, after the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton’s dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws’ handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons’ fair skin and small features, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender. However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If a servant chanced to vex her, it was always—“I shall tell papa!” And if he reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don’t believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an amusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his teaching.  Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else. Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only building she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe—  “Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills? I wonder what lies on the other side—is it the sea?”  “No, Miss Cathy,” I would answer; “it is hills again, just like these.”  “And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?” she once asked.  The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.  “And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?” she pursued.  “Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,” replied I; “you could not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!”  “Oh, you have been on them!” she cried gleefully. “Then I can go, too, when I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?”  “Papa would tell you, Miss,” I answered, hastily, “that they are not worth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him, are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.”  “But I know the park, and I don’t know those,” she murmured to herself. “And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.”  One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he promised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss Catherine measured her age by months, and, “Now, am I old enough to go to Penistone Crags?” was the constant question in her mouth. The road thither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, “Not yet, love: not yet.”  I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts. What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months’ indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.  He was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might entertain herself. I used to send her on her travels round the grounds—now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.  The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced. Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o’clock, and said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her myself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young lady.  “I saw her at morn,” he replied: “she would have me to cut her a hazel switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it is lowest, and galloped out of sight.”  You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly she must have started for Penistone Crags. “What will become of her?” I ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff’s place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. “And what if she should have slipped in clambering among them,” I reflected, “and been killed, or broken some of her bones?” My suspense was truly painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.  “Ah,” said she, “you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don’t be frightened. She’s here safe: but I’m glad it isn’t the master.”  “He is not at home then, is he?” I panted, quite breathless with quick walking and alarm.  “No, no,” she replied: “both he and Joseph are off, and I think they won’t return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.”  I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mother’s when a child. Her hat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton—now a great, strong lad of eighteen—who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.  “Very well, Miss!” I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry countenance. “This is your last ride, till papa comes back. I’ll not trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!”  “Aha, Ellen!” she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. “I shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you’ve found me out. Have you ever been here in your life before?”  “Put that hat on, and home at once,” said I. “I’m dreadfully grieved at you, Miss Cathy: you’ve done extremely wrong! It’s no use pouting and crying: that won’t repay the trouble I’ve had, scouring the country after you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith in you any more.”  “What have I done?” sobbed she, instantly checked. “Papa charged me nothing: he’ll not scold me, Ellen—he’s never cross, like you!”  “Come, come!” I repeated. “I’ll tie the riband. Now, let us have no petulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!”  This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and retreating to the chimney out of my reach.  “Nay,” said the servant, “don’t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean. We made her stop: she’d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be uneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it’s a wild road over the hills.”  Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.  “How long am I to wait?” I continued, disregarding the woman’s interference. “It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so please yourself.”  “The pony is in the yard,” she replied, “and Phoenix is shut in there. He’s bitten—and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it; but you are in a bad temper, and don’t deserve to hear.”  I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue. Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation,—“Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is you’d be glad enough to get out.”  “It’s _your_ father’s, isn’t it?” said she, turning to Hareton.  “Nay,” he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.  He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his own.  “Whose then—your master’s?” she asked.  He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and turned away.  “Who is his master?” continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. “He talked about ‘our house,’ and ‘our folk.’ I thought he had been the owner’s son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn’t he, if he’s a servant?”  Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure.  “Now, get my horse,” she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable-boys at the Grange. “And you may come with me. I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What’s the matter? Get my horse, I say.”  “I’ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!” growled the lad.  “You’ll see me _what?_” asked Catherine in surprise.  “Damned—thou saucy witch!” he replied.  “There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,” I interposed. “Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don’t begin to dispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.”  “But, Ellen,” cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, “how dare he speak so to me? Mustn’t he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked creature, I shall tell papa what you said.—Now, then!”  Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation. “You bring the pony,” she exclaimed, turning to the woman, “and let my dog free this moment!”  “Softly, Miss,” answered the addressed. “You’ll lose nothing by being civil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master’s son, he’s your cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.”  “_He_ my cousin!” cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.  “Yes, indeed,” responded her reprover.  “Oh, Ellen! don’t let them say such things,” she pursued in great trouble. “Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a gentleman’s son. That my—” she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown.  “Hush, hush!” I whispered; “people can have many cousins and of all sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn’t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.”  “He’s not—he’s not my cousin, Ellen!” she went on, gathering fresh grief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea.  I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations; having no doubt of Linton’s approaching arrival, communicated by the former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that Catherine’s first thought on her father’s return would be to seek an explanation of the latter’s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred. Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought. Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.  I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features, and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. Good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff’s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice. And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their “offald ways,” so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton’s faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn’t correct him: nor however culpably he behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton’s blood would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations. I don’t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley’s time were not now enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.  This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw. I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff’s housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always “love,” and “darling,” and “queen,” and “angel,” with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn’t bear that prospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl.     CHAPTER XIX   A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master’s return. Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her “real” cousin. The evening of their expected arrival came. Since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock—poor thing! her aunt’s death impressed her with no definite sorrow—she obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.  “Linton is just six months younger than I am,” she chattered, as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under shadow of the trees. “How delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter than mine—more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I’ve often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy—and papa, dear, dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.”  She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she couldn’t be still a minute.  “How long they are!” she exclaimed. “Ah, I see some dust on the road—they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a little way—half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to that clump of birches at the turn!”  I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her father’s face looking from the window. He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for my master’s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the servants.  “Now, darling,” said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted at the bottom of the front steps: “your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since; therefore, don’t expect him to play and run about with you directly. And don’t harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?”  “Yes, yes, papa,” answered Catherine: “but I do want to see him; and he hasn’t once looked out.”  The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the ground by his uncle.  “This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,” he said, putting their little hands together. “She’s fond of you already; and mind you don’t grieve her by crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.”  “Let me go to bed, then,” answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine’s salute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.  “Come, come, there’s a good child,” I whispered, leading him in. “You’ll make her weep too—see how sorry she is for you!”  I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I proceeded to remove Linton’s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh. My master inquired what was the matter.  “I can’t sit on a chair,” sobbed the boy.  “Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,” answered his uncle patiently.  He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down. Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer, like a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.  “Oh, he’ll do very well,” said the master to me, after watching them a minute. “Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for strength he’ll gain it.”  “Ay, if we can keep him!” I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they’ll be. Our doubts were presently decided—even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep—he would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case—I had come down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that Mr. Heathcliff’s servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with the master.  “I shall ask him what he wants first,” I said, in considerable trepidation. “A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the instant they have returned from a long journey. I don’t think the master can see him.”  Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.  “Good-evening, Joseph,” I said, coldly. “What business brings you here to-night?”  “It’s Maister Linton I mun spake to,” he answered, waving me disdainfully aside.  “Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say, I’m sure he won’t hear it now,” I continued. “You had better sit down in there, and entrust your message to me.”  “Which is his rahm?” pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed doors.  I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition—  “Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn’t goa back ’bout him.”  Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account; but, recalling Isabella’s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. However, he was not going to rouse him from his sleep.  “Tell Mr. Heathcliff,” he answered calmly, “that his son shall come to Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very precarious.”  “Noa!” said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and assuming an authoritative air. “Noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks noa ’count o’ t’ mother, nor ye norther; but he’ll hev his lad; und I mun tak’ him—soa now ye knaw!”  “You shall not to-night!” answered Linton decisively. “Walk down stairs at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him down. Go—”  And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room of him and closed the door.  “Varrah weell!” shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. “To-morn, he’s come hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!”     CHAPTER XX   To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine’s pony; and, said he—“As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to visit the Heights. Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and he has been obliged to leave us.”  Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o’clock, and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.  “My father!” he cried, in strange perplexity. “Mamma never told me I had a father. Where does he live? I’d rather stay with uncle.”  “He lives a little distance from the Grange,” I replied; “just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.”  “But why have I not heard of him before?” asked Linton. “Why didn’t mamma and he live together, as other people do?”  “He had business to keep him in the north,” I answered, “and your mother’s health required her to reside in the south.”  “And why didn’t mamma speak to me about him?” persevered the child. “She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I to love papa? I don’t know him.”  “Oh, all children love their parents,” I said. “Your mother, perhaps, thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you. Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hour’s more sleep.”  “Is _she_ to go with us,” he demanded, “the little girl I saw yesterday?”  “Not now,” replied I.  “Is uncle?” he continued.  “No, I shall be your companion there,” I said.  Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.  “I won’t go without uncle,” he cried at length: “I can’t tell where you mean to take me.”  I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and I had to call for my master’s assistance in coaxing him out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.  “Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?” he inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.  “It is not so buried in trees,” I replied, “and it is not quite so large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is healthier for you—fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the next best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on the moors. Hareton Earnshaw—that is, Miss Cathy’s other cousin, and so yours in a manner—will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and, now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently, walk out on the hills.”  “And what is my father like?” he asked. “Is he as young and handsome as uncle?”  “He’s as young,” said I; “but he has black hair and eyes, and looks sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He’ll not seem to you so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still, mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he’ll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his own.”  “Black hair and eyes!” mused Linton. “I can’t fancy him. Then I am not like him, am I?”  “Not much,” I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid eyes—his mother’s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.  “How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!” he murmured. “Has he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I remember not a single thing about him!”  “Why, Master Linton,” said I, “three hundred miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now it is too late. Don’t trouble him with questions on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.”  The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched to catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode. But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his master’s chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.  “Hallo, Nelly!” said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. “I feared I should have to come down and fetch my property myself. You’ve brought it, have you? Let us see what we can make of it.”  He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.  “Sure-ly,” said Joseph after a grave inspection, “he’s swopped wi’ ye, Maister, an’ yon’s his lass!”  Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a scornful laugh.  “God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!” he exclaimed. “Hav’n’t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my soul! but that’s worse than I expected—and the devil knows I was not sanguine!”  I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father’s speech, or whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff’s taking a seat and bidding him “come hither” he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.  “Tut, tut!” said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin. “None of that nonsense! We’re not going to hurt thee, Linton—isn’t that thy name? Thou art thy mother’s child, entirely! Where is _my_ share in thee, puling chicken?”  He took off the boy’s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.  “Do you know me?” asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble.  “No,” said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.  “You’ve heard of me, I daresay?”  “No,” he replied again.  “No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me! You are my son, then, I’ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed. Now, don’t wince, and colour up! Though it _is_ something to see you have not white blood. Be a good lad; and I’ll do for you. Nelly, if you be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you’ll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won’t be settled while you linger about it.”  “Well,” replied I, “I hope you’ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you’ll not keep him long; and he’s all you have akin in the wide world, that you will ever know—remember.”  “I’ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn’t fear,” he said, laughing. “Only nobody else must be kind to him: I’m jealous of monopolising his affection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some breakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,” he added, when they had departed, “my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor. Besides, he’s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_ descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient: he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!”  While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master’s scorn of the child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.  “Cannot ate it?” repeated he, peering in Linton’s face, and subduing his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. “But Maister Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little ’un; and what wer gooid eneugh for him’s gooid eneugh for ye, I’s rayther think!”  “I _sha’n’t_ eat it!” answered Linton, snappishly. “Take it away.”  Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.  “Is there aught ails th’ victuals?” he asked, thrusting the tray under Heathcliff’s nose.  “What should ail them?” he said.  “Wah!” answered Joseph, “yon dainty chap says he cannut ate ’em. But I guess it’s raight! His mother wer just soa—we wer a’most too mucky to sow t’ corn for makking her breead.”  “Don’t mention his mother to me,” said the master, angrily. “Get him something that he can eat, that’s all. What is his usual food, Nelly?”  I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father’s selfishness may contribute to his comfort. He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I’ll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff’s humour has taken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words—  “Don’t leave me! I’ll not stay here! I’ll not stay here!”  Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come forth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship ended.     CHAPTER XXI   We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, “if I can get him”; and there were no hopes of that. This promise poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.  When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.  “And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,” added the woman; “nor one so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a bit late in the evening. Oh! it’s killing, a breath of night air! And he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph’s bacca-pipe is poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever—heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter; and there he’ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him—Hareton is not bad-natured, though he’s rough—they’re sure to part, one swearing and the other crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw’s thrashing him to a mummy, if he were not his son; and I’m certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then he won’t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him upstairs directly.”  I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she lives there still.  Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy reached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress’s death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement. This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.  “So make haste, Ellen!” she cried. “I know where I wish to go; where a colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made their nests yet.”  “That must be a good distance up,” I answered; “they don’t breed on the edge of the moor.”  “No, it’s not,” she said. “I’ve gone very near with papa.”  I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days. It’s a pity she could not be content.  “Well,” said I, “where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.”  “Oh, a little further—only a little further, Ellen,” was her answer, continually. “Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.”  But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.  Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting out the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff’s land, and he was reproving the poacher.  “I’ve neither taken any nor found any,” she said, as I toiled to them, expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. “I didn’t mean to take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished to see the eggs.”  Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards it, and demanded who “papa” was?  “Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,” she replied. “I thought you did not know me, or you wouldn’t have spoken in that way.”  “You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?” he said, sarcastically.  “And what are you?” inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker. “That man I’ve seen before. Is he your son?”  She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.  “Miss Cathy,” I interrupted, “it will be three hours instead of one that we are out, presently. We really must go back.”  “No, that man is not my son,” answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside. “But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house? You’ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind welcome.”  I whispered Catherine that she mustn’t, on any account, accede to the proposal: it was entirely out of the question.  “Why?” she asked, aloud. “I’m tired of running, and the ground is dewy: I can’t sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his son. He’s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don’t you?”  “I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue—it will be a treat for her to look in on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me, Nelly.”  “No, she’s not going to any such place,” I cried, struggling to release my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones already, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side, and vanished.  “Mr. Heathcliff, it’s very wrong,” I continued: “you know you mean no good. And there she’ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever we return; and I shall have the blame.”  “I want her to see Linton,” he answered; “he’s looking better these few days; it’s not often he’s fit to be seen. And we’ll soon persuade her to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?”  “The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so,” I replied.  “My design is as honest as possible. I’ll inform you of its whole scope,” he said. “That the two cousins may fall in love, and get married. I’m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no expectations, and should she second my wishes she’ll be provided for at once as joint successor with Linton.”  “If Linton died,” I answered, “and his life is quite uncertain, Catherine would be the heir.”  “No, she would not,” he said. “There is no clause in the will to secure it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire their union, and am resolved to bring it about.”  “And I’m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,” I returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.  Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to open the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.  “Now, who is that?” asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. “Can you tell?”  “Your son?” she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the other.  “Yes, yes,” answered he: “but is this the only time you have beheld him? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don’t you recall your cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?”  “What, Linton!” cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name. “Is that little Linton? He’s taller than I am! Are you Linton?”  The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton’s looks and movements were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.  “And you are my uncle, then!” she cried, reaching up to salute him. “I thought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don’t you visit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?”  “I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,” he answered. “There—damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton: they are thrown away on me.”  “Naughty Ellen!” exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses. “Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But I’ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes bring papa. Won’t you be glad to see us?”  “Of course,” replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace, resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. “But stay,” he continued, turning towards the young lady. “Now I think of it, I’d better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if you mention coming here to him, he’ll put a veto on your visits altogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must not mention it.”  “Why did you quarrel?” asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.  “He thought me too poor to wed his sister,” answered Heathcliff, “and was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he’ll never forgive it.”  “That’s wrong!” said the young lady: “some time I’ll tell him so. But Linton and I have no share in your quarrel. I’ll not come here, then; he shall come to the Grange.”  “It will be too far for me,” murmured her cousin: “to walk four miles would kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every morning, but once or twice a week.”  The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.  “I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,” he muttered to me. “Miss Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!—Do you know that, twenty times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I’d have loved the lad had he been some one else. But I think he’s safe from _her_ love. I’ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen. Oh, confound the vapid thing! He’s absorbed in drying his feet, and never looks at her.—Linton!”  “Yes, father,” answered the boy.  “Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel’s nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.”  “Wouldn’t you rather sit here?” asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again.  “I don’t know,” she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and evidently eager to be active.  He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for Hareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair.  “Oh, I’ll ask _you_, uncle,” cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the housekeeper’s assertion. “That is not my cousin, is he?”  “Yes,” he replied, “your mother’s nephew. Don’t you like him?”  Catherine looked queer.  “Is he not a handsome lad?” he continued.  The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in Heathcliff’s ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming—  “You’ll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a—What was it? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the farm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don’t use any bad words; and don’t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly, and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as nicely as you can.”  He watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying the familiar landscape with a stranger’s and an artist’s interest. Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.  “I’ve tied his tongue,” observed Heathcliff. “He’ll not venture a single syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age—nay, some years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ‘gaumless,’ as Joseph calls it?”  “Worse,” I replied, “because more sullen with it.”  “I’ve a pleasure in him,” he continued, reflecting aloud. “He has satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half so much. But he’s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer, though. And he’ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance. I’ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I’ve taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don’t you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as proud as I am of mine. But there’s this difference; one is gold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. _His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing. _I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any, but I, are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You’ll own that I’ve outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring’s wrongs, I should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!”  Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply, because I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of Catherine’s society for fear of a little fatigue. His father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap.  “Get up, you idle boy!” he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. “Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.”  Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and scratched his head like a true clown.  “It’s some damnable writing,” he answered. “I cannot read it.”  “Can’t read it?” cried Catherine; “I can read it: it’s English. But I want to know why it is there.”  Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.  “He does not know his letters,” he said to his cousin. “Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?”  “Is he all as he should be?” asked Miss Cathy, seriously; “or is he simple: not right? I’ve questioned him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly understand _him_, I’m sure!”  Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.  “There’s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?” he said. “My cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the consequence of scorning ‘book-larning,’ as you would say. Have you noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?”  “Why, where the devil is the use on’t?” growled Hareton, more ready in answering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement.  “Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?” tittered Linton. “Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can’t open your mouth without one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!”  “If thou weren’t more a lass than a lad, I’d fell thee this minute, I would; pitiful lath of a crater!” retorted the angry boor, retreating, while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.  Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway: the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton’s faults and deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.  We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.  “Aha!” she cried, “you take papa’s side, Ellen: you are partial I know; or else you wouldn’t have cheated me so many years into the notion that Linton lived a long way from here. I’m really extremely angry; only I’m so pleased I can’t show it! But you must hold your tongue about my uncle; he’s _my_ uncle, remember; and I’ll scold papa for quarrelling with him.”  And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did not see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.  “Papa!” she exclaimed, after the morning’s salutations, “guess whom I saw yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you’ve not done right, have you, now? I saw—but listen, and you shall hear how I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about Linton’s coming back!”  She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew why he had concealed Linton’s near neighbourhood from her? Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?  “It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,” she answered.  “Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?” he said. “No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to explain this some time as you grew older, and I’m sorry I delayed it.”  “But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,” observed Catherine, not at all convinced; “and _he_ didn’t object to our seeing each other: he said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt Isabella. And you won’t. _You_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.”  My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle-in-law’s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton’s death. “She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!” was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy—conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed—was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature—excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till now—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. He merely added: “You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.”  Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found her crying, on her knees by the bedside.  “Oh, fie, silly child!” I exclaimed. “If you had any real griefs you’d be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of coveting more.”  “I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she answered, “it’s for him. He expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he’ll be so disappointed: and he’ll wait for me, and I sha’n’t come!”  “Nonsense!” said I, “do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him? Hasn’t he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no further about you.”  “But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?” she asked, rising to her feet. “And just send those books I promised to lend him? His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not, Ellen?”  “No, indeed! no, indeed!” replied I with decision. “Then he would write to you, and there’d never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see that it is done.”  “But how can one little note—?” she recommenced, putting on an imploring countenance.  “Silence!” I interrupted. “We’ll not begin with your little notes. Get into bed.”  She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance.  “You’ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,” I said, “if you write it; and at present I shall put out your candle.”  I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my hand and a petulant “cross thing!” I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from the village; but that I didn’t learn till some time afterwards. Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.  One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence—daily almost, it must have been—from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more experienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don’t know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.  Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy’s affectionate composition. It was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin’s: very pretty and very silly. I shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet, she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single “Oh!” and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.  “What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?” he said.  His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the hoard.  “No, papa!” she gasped. “Ellen! Ellen! come upstairs—I’m sick!”  I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.  “Oh, Ellen! you have got them,” she commenced immediately, dropping on her knees, when we were enclosed alone. “Oh, give them to me, and I’ll never, never do so again! Don’t tell papa. You have not told papa, Ellen? say you have not? I’ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won’t do it any more!”  With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.  “So,” I exclaimed, “Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems: you may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it’s good enough to be printed! And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him? I hav’n’t shown it yet, but you needn’t imagine I shall keep your ridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I’m certain.”  “I didn’t! I didn’t!” sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. “I didn’t once think of loving him till—”  “_Loving_!” cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word. “_Loving_! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving, indeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I’m going with it to the library; and we’ll see what your father says to such _loving_.”  She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them—do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scold—for I esteemed it all girlish vanity—I at length relented in a measure, and asked,—“If I consent to burn them, will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings, nor playthings?”  “We don’t send playthings,” cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her shame.  “Nor anything at all, then, my lady?” I said. “Unless you will, here I go.”  “I promise, Ellen!” she cried, catching my dress. “Oh, put them in the fire, do, do!”  But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her one or two.  “One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton’s sake!”  I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.  “I will have one, you cruel wretch!” she screamed, darting her hand into the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense of her fingers.  “Very well—and I will have some to exhibit to papa!” I answered, shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.  She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to finish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended to tell my master that the young lady’s qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn’t dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, “Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.” And, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.     CHAPTER XXII   Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.  Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her reading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship no longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible, with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.  On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November—a fresh watery afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds—dark grey streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain—I requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of showers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited—and that she invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. She went sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending. From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs—my nursery lore—to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.  “Look, Miss!” I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree. “Winter is not here yet. There’s a little flower up yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it to show to papa?”  Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length—“No, I’ll not touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?”  “Yes,” I observed, “about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You’re so low, I daresay I shall keep up with you.”  “No,” she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.  “Catherine, why are you crying, love?” I asked, approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder. “You mustn’t cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.”  She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by sobs.  “Oh, it _will_ be something worse,” she said. “And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can’t forget your words, Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary the world will be, when papa and you are dead.”  “None can tell whether you won’t die before us,” I replied. “It’s wrong to anticipate evil. We’ll hope there are years and years to come before any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five. My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr. Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you have counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?”  “But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,” she remarked, gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation.  “Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,” I replied. “She wasn’t as happy as Master: she hadn’t as much to live for. All you need do, is to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy! I’ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.”  “I fret about nothing on earth except papa’s illness,” answered my companion. “I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I’ll never—never—oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word to vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would rather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him better than myself.”  “Good words,” I replied. “But deeds must prove it also; and after he is well, remember you don’t forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.”  As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch the upper, except from Cathy’s present station. In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed scrambling down to recover it. I bid her be cautious lest she got a fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending. I, like a fool, didn’t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and exclaiming—“Ellen! you’ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run round to the porter’s lodge. I can’t scale the ramparts on this side!”  “Stay where you are,” I answered; “I have my bundle of keys in my pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I’ll go.”  Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy’s dance stopped also.  “Who is that?” I whispered.  “Ellen, I wish you could open the door,” whispered back my companion, anxiously.  “Ho, Miss Linton!” cried a deep voice (the rider’s), “I’m glad to meet you. Don’t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and obtain.”  “I sha’n’t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,” answered Catherine. “Papa says you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the same.”  “That is nothing to the purpose,” said Heathcliff. (He it was.) “I don’t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out. I’ve got your letters, and if you give me any pertness I’ll send them to your father. I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn’t you? Well, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in earnest: in love, really. As true as I live, he’s dying for you; breaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually. Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy, he gets worse daily; and he’ll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!”  “How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?” I called from the inside. “Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods? Miss Cathy, I’ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won’t believe that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.”  “I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,” muttered the detected villain. “Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don’t like your double-dealing,” he added aloud. “How could _you_ lie so glaringly as to affirm I hated the ‘poor child’? and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I have not spoken truth: do, there’s a darling! Just imagine your father in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father himself entreated him; and don’t, from pure stupidity, fall into the same error. I swear, on my salvation, he’s going to his grave, and none but you can save him!”  The lock gave way and I issued out.  “I swear Linton is dying,” repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me. “And grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you won’t let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return till this time next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.”  “Come in,” said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.  He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed—  “Miss Catherine, I’ll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I’ll own that he’s with a harsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best medicine. Don’t mind Mrs. Dean’s cruel cautions; but be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be persuaded that you don’t hate him, since you neither write nor call.”  I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and warned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined instinctively that Catherine’s heart was clouded now in double darkness. Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.  The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, and asked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; and afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it appeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her to enjoy it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr. Heathcliff’s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would coincide. Alas! I hadn’t skill to counteract the effect his account had produced: it was just what he intended.  “You may be right, Ellen,” she answered; “but I shall never feel at ease till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don’t write, and convince him that I shall not change.”  What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We parted that night—hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress’s pony. I couldn’t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was founded on fact.     CHAPTER XXIII   The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning—half frost, half drizzle—and temporary brooks crossed our path—gurgling from the uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own affirmation.  Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown deaf, and repeated it louder.  “Na—ay!” he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. “Na—ay! yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough.”  “Joseph!” cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner room. “How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now. Joseph! come this moment.”  Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no ear for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton’s tones, and entered.  “Oh, I hope you’ll die in a garret, starved to death!” said the boy, mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.  He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.  “Is that you, Miss Linton?” he said, raising his head from the arm of the great chair, in which he reclined. “No—don’t kiss me: it takes my breath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,” continued he, after recovering a little from Catherine’s embrace; while she stood by looking very contrite. “Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open; and those—those _detestable_ creatures won’t bring coals to the fire. It’s so cold!”  I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.  “Well, Linton,” murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed, “are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?”  “Why didn’t you come before?” he asked. “You should have come, instead of writing. It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I’d far rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you” (looking at me) “step into the kitchen and see?”  I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest, I replied—  “Nobody is out there but Joseph.”  “I want to drink,” he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. “Zillah is constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it’s miserable! And I’m obliged to come down here—they resolved never to hear me upstairs.”  “Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?” I asked, perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.  “Attentive? He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least,” he cried. “The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.”  Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion, appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.  “And are you glad to see me?” asked she, reiterating her former question, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.  “Yes, I am. It’s something new to hear a voice like yours!” he replied. “But I have been vexed, because you wouldn’t come. And papa swore it was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you don’t despise me, do you, Miss—?”  “I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,” interrupted my young lady. “Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than anybody living. I don’t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come when he returns: will he stay away many days?”  “Not many,” answered Linton; “but he goes on to the moors frequently, since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be peevish with you: you’d not provoke me, and you’d always be ready to help me, wouldn’t you?”  “Yes,” said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, “if I could only get papa’s consent, I’d spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I wish you were my brother.”  “And then you would like me as well as your father?” observed he, more cheerfully. “But papa says you would love me better than him and all the world, if you were my wife; so I’d rather you were that.”  “No, I should never love anybody better than papa,” she returned gravely. “And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.”  Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father’s aversion to her aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn’t succeed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted her relation was false.  “Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,” she answered pertly.  “_My_ papa scorns yours!” cried Linton. “He calls him a sneaking fool.”  “Yours is a wicked man,” retorted Catherine; “and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave him as she did.”  “She didn’t leave him,” said the boy; “you sha’n’t contradict me.”  “She did,” cried my young lady.  “Well, I’ll tell _you_ something!” said Linton. “Your mother hated your father: now then.”  “Oh!” exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.  “And she loved mine,” added he.  “You little liar! I hate you now!” she panted, and her face grew red with passion.  “She did! she did!” sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair, and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant, who stood behind.  “Hush, Master Heathcliff!” I said; “that’s your father’s tale, too, I suppose.”  “It isn’t: you hold your tongue!” he answered. “She did, she did, Catherine! she did, she did!”  Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even me. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down silently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.  “How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired, after waiting ten minutes.  “I wish _she_ felt as I do,” he replied: “spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was better to-day: and there—” his voice died in a whimper.  “_I_ didn’t strike you!” muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion.  He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice.  “I’m sorry I hurt you, Linton,” she said at length, racked beyond endurance. “But _I_ couldn’t have been hurt by that little push, and I had no idea that you could, either: you’re not much, are you, Linton? Don’t let me go home thinking I’ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.”  “I can’t speak to you,” he murmured; “you’ve hurt me so that I shall lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you’d know what it was; but _you’ll_ be comfortably asleep while I’m in agony, and nobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!” And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.  “Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,” I said, “it won’t be Miss who spoils your ease: you’d be the same had she never come. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you’ll get quieter when we leave you.”  “Must I go?” asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. “Do you want me to go, Linton?”  “You can’t alter what you’ve done,” he replied pettishly, shrinking from her, “unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.”  “Well, then, I must go?” she repeated.  “Let me alone, at least,” said he; “I can’t bear your talking.”  She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream. Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.  “I shall lift him on to the settle,” I said, “and he may roll about as he pleases: we can’t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss Cathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then, there he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense, he’ll be glad to lie still.”  She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a stone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.  “I can’t do with that,” he said; “it’s not high enough.”  Catherine brought another to lay above it.  “That’s _too_ high,” murmured the provoking thing.  “How must I arrange it, then?” she asked despairingly.  He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and converted her shoulder into a support.  “No, that won’t do,” I said. “You’ll be content with the cushion, Master Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot remain five minutes longer.”  “Yes, yes, we can!” replied Cathy. “He’s good and patient now. He’s beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn’t come, if I have hurt you.”  “You must come, to cure me,” he answered. “You ought to come, because you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when you entered as I am at present—was I?”  “But you’ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.—I didn’t do it all,” said his cousin. “However, we’ll be friends now. And you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?”  “I told you I did,” he replied impatiently. “Sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee. That’s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons together. Sit quite still and don’t talk: but you may sing a song, if you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad—one of those you promised to teach me; or a story. I’d rather have a ballad, though: begin.”  Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner.  “And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?” asked young Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.  “No,” I answered, “nor next day neither.” She, however, gave a different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear.  “You won’t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!” I commenced, when we were out of the house. “You are not dreaming of it, are you?”  She smiled.  “Oh, I’ll take good care,” I continued: “I’ll have that lock mended, and you can escape by no way else.”  “I can get over the wall,” she said laughing. “The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I’m almost seventeen: I’m a woman. And I’m certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him. I’m older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, am I not? And he’ll soon do as I direct him, with some slight coaxing. He’s a pretty little darling when he’s good. I’d make such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we, after we were used to each other? Don’t you like him, Ellen?”  “Like him!” I exclaimed. “The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured, he’ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he’ll see spring, indeed. And small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he’d be. I’m glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine.”  My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.  “He’s younger than I,” she answered, after a protracted pause of meditation, “and he ought to live the longest: he will—he must live as long as I do. He’s as strong now as when he first came into the north; I’m positive of that. It’s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn’t he?”  “Well, well,” I cried, “after all, we needn’t trouble ourselves; for listen, Miss,—and mind, I’ll keep my word,—if you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.”  “It has been revived,” muttered Cathy, sulkily.  “Must not be continued, then,” I said.  “We’ll see,” was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the rear.  We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights had done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say, since.  My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton’s room she appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I generally needed nothing after six o’clock, thus the evening was her own. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.     CHAPTER XXIV   At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused. She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then came frequent questions.  “Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn’t you better lie down now? You’ll be sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.”  “No, no, dear, I’m not tired,” I returned, continually.  Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching, and—  “Ellen, I’m tired.”  “Give over then and talk,” I answered.  That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep; judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs in the dark. No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below. The servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar’s door; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my candle, and seated myself in the window.  The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and reappeared presently, leading Miss’s pony; and there she was, just dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and stood fixed.  “My dear Miss Catherine,” I began, too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold, “where have you been riding out at this hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where have you been? Speak!”  “To the bottom of the park,” she stammered. “I didn’t tell a tale.”  “And nowhere else?” I demanded.  “No,” was the muttered reply.  “Oh, Catherine!” I cried, sorrowfully. “You know you have been doing wrong, or you wouldn’t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That does grieve me. I’d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a deliberate lie.”  She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my neck.  “Well, Ellen, I’m so afraid of you being angry,” she said. “Promise not to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.”  We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced—  “I’ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I’ve never missed going a day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn’t scold _him_ either, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and couldn’t come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the pony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that satisfied him better.  “On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his dogs—robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards—we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn’t repeat that, because you would call it silly.  “One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That was his most perfect idea of heaven’s happiness: mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.  “After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and we’d have a game at blindman’s-buff; she should try to catch us: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn’t: there was no pleasure in it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn’t like it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs—_your_ songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till morning.  “On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny’s neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, ‘It wouldn’t do mitch hurt if it did;’ and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: ‘Miss Catherine! I can read yon, now.’  “‘Wonderful,’ I exclaimed. ‘Pray let us hear you—you _are_ grown clever!’  “He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name—‘Hareton Earnshaw.’  “‘And the figures?’ I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a dead halt.  “‘I cannot tell them yet,’ he answered.  “‘Oh, you dunce!’ I said, laughing heartily at his failure.  “The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He reddened—I saw that by the moonlight—dropped his hand from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn’t think the same.”  “Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!” I interrupted. “I shall not scold, but I don’t like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I’m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.”  “Well, Ellen, you won’t cry about it, will you?” she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness. “But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.  “‘I’m ill to-night, Catherine, love,’ he said; ‘and you must have all the talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you wouldn’t break your word, and I’ll make you promise again, before you go.’  “I knew now that I mustn’t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.  “‘Get to thy own room!’ he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with passion; and his face looked swelled and furious. ‘Take her there if she comes to see thee: thou shalln’t keep me out of this. Begone wi’ ye both!’  “He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly longing to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.  “‘I wer sure he’d sarve ye out! He’s a grand lad! He’s getten t’ raight sperrit in him! _He_ knaws—ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t’ maister yonder—Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift properly! Ech, ech, ech!’  “‘Where must we go?’ I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch’s mockery.  “Linton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no! he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic, powerless fury. He grasped the handle of the door, and shook it: it was fastened inside.  “‘If you don’t let me in, I’ll kill you!—If you don’t let me in, I’ll kill you!’ he rather shrieked than said. ‘Devil! devil!—I’ll kill you—I’ll kill you!’  “Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.  “‘Thear, that’s t’ father!’ he cried. ‘That’s father! We’ve allas summut o’ either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad—dunnut be ’feard—he cannot get at thee!’  “I took hold of Linton’s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired what there was to do? I hadn’t breath to explain; dragging her in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and said I shouldn’t go in: I must go home. I exclaimed that he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter. Joseph locked the door, and declared I should do ‘no sich stuff,’ and asked me whether I were ‘bahn to be as mad as him.’ I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn’t do with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.  “Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me ‘wisht,’ and denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold of me.  “‘Miss Catherine, I’m ill grieved,’ he began, ‘but it’s rayther too bad—’  “I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more than half out of my senses.  “I didn’t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn’t go to Wuthering Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the third day I took courage: at least, I couldn’t bear longer suspense, and stole off once more. I went at five o’clock, and walked; fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton’s room, unobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah received me, and saying ‘the lad was mending nicely,’ showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he would neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a faint ‘Catherine!’ He did not reckon on being answered so: but I wouldn’t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed. It _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong to refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said ‘Yes,’ and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use trying to conceal my presence.  “‘Young master is in the house,’ said Zillah, as she saw me making for the parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true—  “‘As you don’t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see me, and that he mustn’t invent any more falsehoods on the subject.’  “‘Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,’ he answered. ‘You are so much happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody! I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you’ll get rid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn’t, and cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent it till I die!’  “I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted nature. He’ll never let his friends be at ease, and he’ll never be at ease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night; because his father returned the day after.  “About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I’ve learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. I can’t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly behaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff’s lecture by entering and telling him so. He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of the matter. Since then, I’ve told Linton he must whisper his bitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can’t be prevented from going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas, if you’ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of none. You’ll not tell, will you? It will be very heartless, if you do.”  “I’ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,” I replied. “It requires some study; and so I’ll leave you to your rest, and go think it over.”  I thought it over aloud, in my master’s presence; walking straight from her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end. In vain she wept and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew’s disposition and state of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.     CHAPTER XXV   “These things happened last winter, sir,” said Mrs. Dean; “hardly more than a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months’ end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them! Yet, who knows how long you’ll be a stranger? You’re too young to rest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one could see Catherine Linton and not love her. You smile; but why do you look so lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and why—?”  “Stop, my good friend!” I cried. “It may be very possible that _I_ should love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not here. I’m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on. Was Catherine obedient to her father’s commands?”  “She was,” continued the housekeeper. “Her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days afterwards, ‘I wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what you think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect of improvement, as he grows a man?’  “‘He’s very delicate, sir,’ I replied; ‘and scarcely likely to reach manhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if Miss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent. However, master, you’ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his being of age.’”  Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the sparely-scattered gravestones.  “I’ve prayed often,” he half soliloquised, “for the approach of what is coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks, to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I’ve been very happy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side. But I’ve been as happy musing by myself among those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June evenings, on the green mound of her mother’s grave, and wishing—yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I do for Cathy? How must I quit her? I’d not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff’s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss. I’d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing! But should Linton be unworthy—only a feeble tool to his father—I cannot abandon her to him! And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die. Darling! I’d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.”  “Resign her to God as it is, sir,” I answered, “and if we should lose you—which may He forbid—under His providence, I’ll stand her friend and counsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don’t fear that she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded.”  Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her inexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering. On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was raining, and I observed—  “You’ll surely not go out to-night, sir?”  He answered,—“No, I’ll defer it this year a little longer.”  He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the invalid been presentable, I’ve no doubt his father would have permitted him to come. As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but his uncle’s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.  That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own. Heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine’s company, then.  “I do not ask,” he said, “that she may visit here; but am I never to see her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the Heights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have done nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you that my father’s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also. You inquire after my health—it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?”  Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his request; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer, perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family. Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises.  Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady’s fortune, he had a natural desire that she might retain—or at least return in a short time to—the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part, began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death.     CHAPTER XXVI   Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads. On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger, told us that,—“Maister Linton wer just o’ this side th’ Heights: and he’d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.”  “Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,” I observed: “he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at once.”  “Well, we’ll turn our horses’ heads round when we reach him,” answered my companion; “our excursion shall lie towards home.”  But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount, and leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so feebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,—“Why, Master Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill you do look!”  Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse than usual?  “No—better—better!” he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed.  “But you have been worse,” persisted his cousin; “worse than when I saw you last; you are thinner, and—”  “I’m tired,” he interrupted, hurriedly. “It is too hot for walking, let us rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick—papa says I grow so fast.”  Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.  “This is something like your paradise,” said she, making an effort at cheerfulness. “You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than sunshine. Next week, if you can, we’ll ride down to the Grange Park, and try mine.”  Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to depart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at least.  “But I think,” said Cathy, “you’d be more comfortable at home than sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you, I’d willingly stay.”  “Stay to rest yourself,” he replied. “And, Catherine, don’t think or say that I’m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell uncle I’m in tolerable health, will you?”  “I’ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn’t affirm that you are,” observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth.  “And be here again next Thursday,” continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze. “And give him my thanks for permitting you to come—my best thanks, Catherine. And—and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked you about me, don’t lead him to suppose that I’ve been extremely silent and stupid: don’t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing—he’ll be angry.”  “I care nothing for his anger,” exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be its object.  “But I do,” said her cousin, shuddering. “_Don’t_ provoke him against me, Catherine, for he is very hard.”  “Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired. “Has he grown weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?”  Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.  “Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?” she whispered in my ear, at last. “I can’t tell why we should stay. He’s asleep, and papa will be wanting us back.”  “Well, we must not leave him asleep,” I answered; “wait till he wakes, and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to see poor Linton has soon evaporated!”  “Why did _he_ wish to see me?” returned Catherine. “In his crossest humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious mood. It’s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform—this interview—for fear his father should scold him. But I’m hardly going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I’m glad he’s better in health, I’m sorry he’s so much less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me.”  “You think _he is_ better in health, then?” I said.  “Yes,” she answered; “because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell papa; but he’s better, very likely.”  “There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,” I remarked; “I should conjecture him to be far worse.”  Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if any one had called his name.  “No,” said Catherine; “unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.”  “I thought I heard my father,” he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab above us. “You are sure nobody spoke?”  “Quite sure,” replied his cousin. “Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we separated in winter? If you be, I’m certain one thing is not stronger—your regard for me: speak,—are you?”  The tears gushed from Linton’s eyes as he answered, “Yes, yes, I am!” And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner.  Cathy rose. “For to-day we must part,” she said. “And I won’t conceal that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I’ll mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.”  “Hush,” murmured Linton; “for God’s sake, hush! He’s coming.” And he clung to Catherine’s arm, striving to detain her; but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who obeyed her like a dog.  “I’ll be here next Thursday,” she cried, springing to the saddle. “Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!”  And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was he in anticipating his father’s approach.  Before we reached home, Catherine’s displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts about Linton’s actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a second journey would make us better judges. My master requested an account of our ongoings. His nephew’s offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.     CHAPTER XXVII   Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of Edgar Linton’s state. The havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her father stopped a short time daily—the brief period he could bear to sit up—and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.  He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for Linton’s letters bore few or no indications of his defective character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account.  We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine’s face was just like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares.  We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before. My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn’t risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together. Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like fear.  “It is late!” he said, speaking short and with difficulty. “Is not your father very ill? I thought you wouldn’t come.”  “_Why_ won’t you be candid?” cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting. “Why cannot you say at once you don’t want me? It is strange, Linton, that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!”  Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but his cousin’s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour.  “My father _is_ very ill,” she said; “and why am I called from his bedside? Why didn’t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you wished I wouldn’t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can’t dance attendance on your affectations now!”  “My affectations!” he murmured; “what are they? For heaven’s sake, Catherine, don’t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can’t be scorned enough; but I’m too mean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.”  “Nonsense!” cried Catherine in a passion. “Foolish, silly boy! And there! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn’t bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from the hearth-stone, and pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock! If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise, and don’t degrade yourself into an abject reptile—_don’t_!”  With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror.  “Oh!” he sobbed, “I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I’m a traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be killed! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn’t harm you. You’ll not go, then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent—and he’ll let me die with you!”  My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him. The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.  “Consent to what?” she asked. “To stay! tell me the meaning of this strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your heart. You wouldn’t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn’t let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I’ll believe you are a coward, for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.”  “But my father threatened me,” gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated fingers, “and I dread him—I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!”  “Oh, well!” said Catherine, with scornful compassion, “keep your secret: _I’m_ no coward. Save yourself: I’m not afraid!”  Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when, hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn’t cast a glance towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton’s sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn’t avoid doubting, he said—  “It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,” he added, in a lower tone, “that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his illness?”  “No; my master is dying,” I replied: “it is true enough. A sad thing it will be for us all, but a blessing for him!”  “How long will he last, do you think?” he asked.  “I don’t know,” I said.  “Because,” he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account—“because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I’d thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?”  “Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress,” I answered. “To see him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.”  “He shall be, in a day or two,” muttered Heathcliff. “But first—get up, Linton! Get up!” he shouted. “Don’t grovel on the ground there: up, this moment!”  Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear, caused by his father’s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing else to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf.  “Now,” said he, with curbed ferocity, “I’m getting angry—and if you don’t command that paltry spirit of yours—_damn_ you! get up directly!”  “I will, father,” he panted. “Only, let me alone, or I shall faint. I’ve done as you wished, I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that I—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.”  “Take mine,” said his father; “stand on your feet. There now—she’ll lend you her arm: that’s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.”  “Linton dear!” whispered Catherine, “I can’t go to Wuthering Heights: papa has forbidden me. He’ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?”  “I can never re-enter that house,” he answered. “I’m _not_ to re-enter it without you!”  “Stop!” cried his father. “We’ll respect Catherine’s filial scruples. Nelly, take him in, and I’ll follow your advice concerning the doctor, without delay.”  “You’ll do well,” replied I. “But I must remain with my mistress: to mind your son is not my business.”  “You are very stiff,” said Heathcliff, “I know that: but you’ll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity. Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?”  He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial. However I disapproved, I couldn’t hinder her: indeed, how could she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed—“My house is not stricken with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me to shut the door.”  He shut and locked it also. I started.  “You shall have tea before you go home,” he added. “I am by myself. Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I’m used to being alone, I’d rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton, take your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I mean. How she does stare! It’s odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two, as an evening’s amusement.”  He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, “By hell! I hate them.”  “I am not afraid of you!” exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution. “Give me that key: I will have it!” she said. “I wouldn’t eat or drink here, if I were starving.”  Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered it speedily.  “Now, Catherine Linton,” he said, “stand off, or I shall knock you down; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.”  Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents again. “We _will_ go!” she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment. Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.  At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. “You villain!” I began to cry, “you villain!” A touch on the chest silenced me: I am stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I staggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released, put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.  “I know how to chastise children, you see,” said the scoundrel, grimly, as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the floor. “Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall be your father, to-morrow—all the father you’ll have in a few days—and you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you’re no weakling: you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again!”  Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and handed me a cup.  “Wash away your spleen,” he said. “And help your own naughty pet and mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I’m going out to seek your horses.”  Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the windows—they were too narrow for even Cathy’s little figure.  “Master Linton,” I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, “you know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I’ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin’s.”  “Yes, Linton, you must tell,” said Catherine. “It was for your sake I came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.”  “Give me some tea, I’m thirsty, and then I’ll tell you,” he answered. “Mrs. Dean, go away. I don’t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won’t drink that. Give me another.”  Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted at the little wretch’s composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.  “Papa wants us to be married,” he continued, after sipping some of the liquid. “And he knows your papa wouldn’t let us marry now; and he’s afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you shall return home next day, and take me with you.”  “Take you with her, pitiful changeling!” I exclaimed. “_You_ marry? Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the notion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly puling tricks: and—don’t look so silly, now! I’ve a very good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile conceit.”  I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked me.  “Stay all night? No,” she said, looking slowly round. “Ellen, I’ll burn that door down but I’ll get out.”  And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing:—“Won’t you have me, and save me? not let me come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn’t go and leave, after all. You _must_ obey my father—you _must_!”  “I must obey my own,” she replied, “and relieve him from this cruel suspense. The whole night! What would he think? He’ll be distressed already. I’ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet! You’re in no danger; but if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better than you!”  The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff’s anger restored to the boy his coward’s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn, persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus occupied, our jailor re-entered.  “Your beasts have trotted off,” he said, “and—now Linton! snivelling again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and get to bed. In a month or two, my lad, you’ll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You’re pining for pure love, are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There, to bed! Zillah won’t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush! hold your noise! Once in your own room, I’ll not come near you: you needn’t fear. By chance, you’ve managed tolerably. I’ll look to the rest.”  He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness, but he scowled on her and muttered—“Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!”  “I _am_ afraid now,” she replied, “because, if I stay, papa will be miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when he—Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do what I’ll willingly do of myself?”  “Let him dare to force you,” I cried. “There’s law in the land, thank God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I’d inform if he were my own son: and it’s felony without benefit of clergy!”  “Silence!” said the ruffian. “To the devil with your clamour! I don’t want _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton, I’ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled.”  “Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I’m safe!” exclaimed Catherine, weeping bitterly. “Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he’ll think we’re lost. What shall we do?”  “Not he! He’ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a little amusement,” answered Heathcliff. “You cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went out of it. I’d join him. I don’t love you! How should I? Weep away. As far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind—that’s paternal. But Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself. Linton can play the little tyrant well. He’ll undertake to torture any number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You’ll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get home again, I assure you.”  “You’re right there!” I said; “explain your son’s character. Show his resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice!”  “I don’t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,” he answered; “because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you’ll have an opportunity of judging!”  “I’ll not retract my word,” said Catherine. “I’ll marry him within this hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff, you’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from _mere_ malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your knee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! _do_ look! you’ll see nothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck me. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_? Ah! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and pitying me.”  “Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!” cried Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. “I’d rather be hugged by a snake. How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!”  He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was growing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host hurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.  “I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,” I observed to Catherine. “I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?”  “It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,” said Heathcliff, overhearing me. “You should have opened a lattice and called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn’t. She’s glad to be obliged to stay, I’m certain.”  At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o’clock. Then he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah’s chamber; and I whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.  At seven o’clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She ran to the door immediately, and answered, “Yes.” “Here, then,” he said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned the lock again. I demanded my release.  “Be patient,” he replied; “I’ll send up your breakfast in a while.”  I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff’s.  “I’ve brought you something to eat,” said a voice; “oppen t’ door!”  Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all day.  “Tak’ it,” he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.  “Stay one minute,” I began.  “Nay,” cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to detain him.  And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion.     CHAPTER XXVIII   On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step approached—lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.  “Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!” she exclaimed. “Well! there is a talk about you at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you’d been found, and he’d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure? And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But you’re not so thin—you’ve not been so poorly, have you?”  “Your master is a true scoundrel!” I replied. “But he shall answer for it. He needn’t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!”  “What do you mean?” asked Zillah. “It’s not his tale: they tell that in the village—about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw, when I come in—‘Eh, they’s queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I went off. It’s a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly Dean.’ He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said, ‘If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire’s funeral.’”  “Mr. Edgar is not dead?” I gasped. “Oh! Zillah, Zillah!”  “No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,” she replied; “you’re right sickly yet. He’s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another day. I met him on the road and asked.”  Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle, sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes. “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded sternly, supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.  “Is she gone?” I said.  “No,” he replied; “she’s upstairs: she’s not to go; we won’t let her.”  “You won’t let her, little idiot!” I exclaimed. “Direct me to her room immediately, or I’ll make you sing out sharply.”  “Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,” he answered. “He says I’m not to be soft with Catherine: she’s my wife, and it’s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan’t have it: and she shan’t go home! She never shall!—she may cry, and be sick as much as she pleases!”  He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to drop asleep.  “Master Heathcliff,” I resumed, “have you forgotten all Catherine’s kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That’s fine gratitude, is it not?”  The corner of Linton’s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his lips.  “Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?” I continued. “Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you will have any. And you say she’s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up there in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them, too; but you won’t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see—an elderly woman, and a servant merely—and you, after pretending such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you’re a heartless, selfish boy!”  “I can’t stay with her,” he answered crossly. “I’ll not stay by myself. She cries so I can’t bear it. And she won’t give over, though I say I’ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn’t sleep.”  “Is Mr. Heathcliff out?” I inquired, perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin’s mental tortures.  “He’s in the court,” he replied, “talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says uncle is dying, truly, at last. I’m glad, for I shall be master of the Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn’t hers! It’s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday—I said _they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful thing wouldn’t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked out—that frightens her—she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and divided the case, and gave me her mother’s portrait; the other she attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me; she refused, and he—he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot.”  “And were you pleased to see her struck?” I asked: having my designs in encouraging his talk.  “I winked,” he answered: “I wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first—she deserved punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can’t speak for pain. I don’t like to think so; but she’s a naughty thing for crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I’m afraid of her.”  “And you can get the key if you choose?” I said.  “Yes, when I am upstairs,” he answered; “but I can’t walk upstairs now.”  “In what apartment is it?” I asked.  “Oh,” he cried, “I shan’t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret. Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you’ve tired me—go away, go away!” And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again.  I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar’s door: but I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him, even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and spoke.  “Catherine is coming, dear master!” I whispered; “she is alive and well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.”  I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up, looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe all his father’s brutal conduct—my intentions being to add no bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.  He divined that one of his enemy’s purposes was to secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together. However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving Catherine’s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.  Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!  Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone downstairs at three o’clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump. “Oh! it is Green,” I said, recollecting myself—“only Green,” and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, “Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?”  “Yes,” I cried: “yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with us again!”  She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton’s room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron. Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me she would not complain.  I couldn’t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed, then. All was composed, however: Catherine’s despair was as silent as her father’s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.  He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he murmured,—“I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!” and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a struggle.  Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master’s summons. Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter’s mind, to disturb him, after his daughter’s arrival.  Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to stay at the Grange till her father’s corpse had quitted it.  She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff’s answer. It drove her desperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole out before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother’s, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances.     CHAPTER XXIX   The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the library; now musing mournfully—one of us despairingly—on our loss, now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.  We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton’s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a servant—one of the discarded ones, not yet departed—rushed hastily in, and said “that devil Heathcliff” was coming through the court: should he fasten the door in his face?  If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and availed himself of the master’s privilege to walk straight in, without saying a word. The sound of our informant’s voice directed him to the library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.  It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband. Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person either. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.  “Stop!” he said, arresting her by the arm. “No more runnings away! Where would you go? I’m come to fetch you home; and I hope you’ll be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business: he’s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you’ll see by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he’s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.”  “Why not let Catherine continue here,” I pleaded, “and send Master Linton to her? As you hate them both, you’d not miss them: they _can_ only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.”  “I’m seeking a tenant for the Grange,” he answered; “and I want my children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services for her bread. I’m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don’t oblige me to compel you.”  “I shall,” said Catherine. “Linton is all I have to love in the world, and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!”  “You are a boastful champion,” replied Heathcliff; “but I don’t like you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to you—it is his own sweet spirit. He’s as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences: don’t expect thanks for this noble devotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.”  “I know he has a bad nature,” said Catherine: “he’s your son. But I’m glad I’ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_ miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him? _Nobody_ loves you—_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn’t be you!”  Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.  “You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,” said her father-in-law, “if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your things!”  She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah’s place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton’s, he said—“I shall have that home. Not because I need it, but—” He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile—“I’ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was digging Linton’s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again—it is hers yet!—he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton’s side, damn him! I wish he’d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I’m laid there, and slide mine out too; I’ll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us he’ll not know which is which!”  “You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!” I exclaimed; “were you not ashamed to disturb the dead?”  “I disturbed nobody, Nelly,” he replied; “and I gave some ease to myself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you’ll have a better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen years—incessantly—remorselessly—till yesternight; and yesternight I was tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.”  “And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of then?” I said.  “Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!” he answered. “Do you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a transformation on raising the lid, but I’m better pleased that it should not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as winter—all round was solitary. I didn’t fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us, I said to myself—‘I’ll have her in my arms again! If she be cold, I’ll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.’ I got a spade from the tool-house, and began to delve with all my might—it scraped the coffin; I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down. ‘If I can only get this off,’ I muttered, ‘I wish they may shovel in the earth over us both!’ and I wrenched at it more desperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying upstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently—I felt her by me—I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning—from the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I’ve been the sport of that intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of Linton’s. When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain! And when I slept in her chamber—I was beaten out of that. I couldn’t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night—to be always disappointed! It racked me! I’ve often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I’ve seen her, I’m pacified—a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years!”  Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence. I didn’t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be saddled.  “Send that over to-morrow,” said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her, he added: “You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you’ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own feet will serve you. Come along.”  “Good-bye, Ellen!” whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me, her lips felt like ice. “Come and see me, Ellen; don’t forget.”  “Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!” said her new father. “When I wish to speak to you I’ll come here. I want none of your prying at my house!”  He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine’s arm under his: though she disputed the act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley, whose trees concealed them.     CHAPTER XXX   I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her, and wouldn’t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was “thrang,” and the master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on, otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child’s annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.  “The first thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said, “on her arrival at the Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton’s room, and remained till morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for? her cousin was very ill.  “‘We know that!’ answered Heathcliff; ‘but his life is not worth a farthing, and I won’t spend a farthing on him.’  “‘But I cannot tell how to do,’ she said; ‘and if nobody will help me, he’ll die!’  “‘Walk out of the room,’ cried the master, ‘and let me never hear a word more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.’  “Then she began to bother me, and I said I’d had enough plague with the tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton: Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.  “How they managed together, I can’t tell. I fancy he fretted a great deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice, after we had gone to bed, I’ve happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs’-top; and then I’ve shut myself in quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I’m sure: still I didn’t wish to lose my place, you know.  “At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me out of my wits, by saying, ‘Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying—I’m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.’  “Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred—the house was quiet.  “She’s mistaken, I said to myself. He’s got over it. I needn’t disturb them; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell—the only bell we have, put up on purpose for Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and inform them that he wouldn’t have that noise repeated.  “I delivered Catherine’s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I followed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to Linton’s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to her.  “‘Now—Catherine,’ he said, ‘how do you feel?’  “She was dumb.  “‘How do you feel, Catherine?’ he repeated.  “‘He’s safe, and I’m free,’ she answered: ‘I should feel well—but,’ she continued, with a bitterness she couldn’t conceal, ‘you have left me so long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I feel like death!’  “And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton and Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe, of the lad’s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn’t want his help. He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.  “In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he replied,—‘Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell me.’”  Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.  Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton’s will. He had bequeathed the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during her week’s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wife’s right and his also: I suppose legally; at any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.  “Nobody,” said Zillah, “ever approached her door, except that once, but I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn’t bear any longer being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn’t hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker: she couldn’t comb them out.  “Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:” the kirk, (you know, has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists’ or Baptists’ place, I can’t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.) “Joseph had gone,” she continued, “but I thought proper to bide at home. Young folks are always the better for an elder’s over-looking; and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn’t a model of nice behaviour. I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes. The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion. He grew sullen, and began to swear.  “Now, Mrs. Dean,” Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner, “you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen you’re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now? She’s as poor as you or I: poorer, I’ll be bound: you’re saving, and I’m doing my little all that road.”  Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper’s account.  “Missis walked in,” she said, “as chill as an icicle, and as high as a princess. I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair. No, she turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.  “‘I’ve been starved a month and more,’ she answered, resting on the word as scornful as she could.  “And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that came to hand.  “That was a great advance for the lad. She didn’t thank him; still, he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for something to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn’t see, and she couldn’t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a taking.  “‘Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping there?’ she cried, in a tone of disgust. ‘I can’t endure you! I’ll go upstairs again, if you come near me.’  “Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down in the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.  “‘Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I’m stalled of doing naught; and I do like—I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask of yourseln.’  “‘Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma’am,’ I said, immediately. ‘He’d take it very kind—he’d be much obliged.’  “She frowned; and looking up, answered—  “‘Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of your faces, you all kept off. But I won’t complain to you! I’m driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.’  “‘What could I ha’ done?’ began Earnshaw. ‘How was I to blame?’  “‘Oh! you are an exception,’ answered Mrs. Heathcliff. ‘I never missed such a concern as you.’  “‘But I offered more than once, and asked,’ he said, kindling up at her pertness, ‘I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you—’  “‘Be silent! I’ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear!’ said my lady.  “Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his gun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He talked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I’ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she’ll curl back without respect of any one. She’ll snap at the master himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.”  At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me: but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange.  * * * * *   Thus ended Mrs. Dean’s story. Notwithstanding the doctor’s prophecy, I am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another tenant to take the place after October. I would not pass another winter here for much.     CHAPTER XXXI   Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.  I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would be in at dinner-time. It was eleven o’clock, and I announced my intention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute for the host.  We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.  “She does not seem so amiable,” I thought, “as Mrs. Dean would persuade me to believe. She’s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.”  Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. “Remove them yourself,” she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean’s note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton—but she asked aloud, “What is that?” And chucked it off.  “A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,” I answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first. Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:  “I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be climbing up there! Oh! I’m tired—I’m _stalled_, Hareton!” And she leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her.  “Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said, after sitting some time mute, “you are not aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it strange you won’t come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you; and she’ll be greatly disappointed if I return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter and said nothing!”  She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,—  “Does Ellen like you?”  “Yes, very well,” I replied, hesitatingly.  “You must tell her,” she continued, “that I would answer her letter, but I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear a leaf.”  “No books!” I exclaimed. “How do you contrive to live here without them? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a large library, I’m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and I should be desperate!”  “I was always reading, when I had them,” said Catherine; “and Mr. Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched through Joseph’s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room—some Latin and Greek, and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here—and you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall. Perhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures? But I’ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!”  Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations.  “Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,” I said, coming to his rescue. “He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your attainments. He’ll be a clever scholar in a few years.”  “And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,” answered Catherine. “Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you couldn’t read their explanations!”  The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean’s anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I observed,—“But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.”  “Oh!” she replied, “I don’t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of deliberate malice.”  Hareton’s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into Catherine’s lap, exclaiming,—“Take them! I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!”  “I won’t have them now,” she answered. “I shall connect them with you, and hate them.”  She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it from her. “And listen,” she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion.  But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue. The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin’s sensitive though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path. Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result.  “Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!” cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes.  “You’d _better_ hold your tongue, now,” he answered fiercely.  And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and laying hold of his shoulder asked,—“What’s to do now, my lad?”  “Naught, naught,” he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude.  Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.  “It will be odd if I thwart myself,” he muttered, unconscious that I was behind him. “But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_ every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to see him.”  He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a restless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so that I remained alone.  “I’m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, in reply to my greeting; “from selfish motives partly: I don’t think I could readily supply your loss in this desolation. I’ve wondered more than once what brought you here.”  “An idle whim, I fear, sir,” was my answer; “or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall not live there any more.”  “Oh, indeed; you’re tired of being banished from the world, are you?” he said. “But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won’t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from any one.”  “I’m coming to plead off nothing about it,” I exclaimed, considerably irritated. “Should you wish it, I’ll settle with you now,” and I drew my note-book from my pocket.  “No, no,” he replied, coolly; “you’ll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts, if you fail to return: I’m not in such a hurry. Sit down and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome. Catherine! bring the things in: where are you?”  Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.  “You may get your dinner with Joseph,” muttered Heathcliff, aside, “and remain in the kitchen till he is gone.”  She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.  With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton, absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could not fulfil my wish.  “How dreary life gets over in that house!” I reflected, while riding down the road. “What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town!”     CHAPTER XXXII   1802.—This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after other folk wi’ ther harvest.”  “Gimmerton?” I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy. “Ah! I know. How far is it from this?”  “Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,” he answered.  A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we managed the distance in some three hours.  I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm weather—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer August, I’m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.  I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.  “Is Mrs. Dean within?” I demanded of the dame.  “Mistress Dean? Nay!” she answered, “she doesn’t bide here: shoo’s up at th’ Heights.”  “Are you the housekeeper, then?” I continued.  “Eea, Aw keep th’ hause,” she replied.  “Well, I’m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me in, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.”  “T’ maister!” she cried in astonishment. “Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming? Yah sud ha’ send word. They’s nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t’ place: nowt there isn’t!”  She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return. Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An after-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.  “All well at the Heights?” I inquired of the woman.  “Eea, f’r owt ee knaw!” she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders.  I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind, and the mild glory of a rising moon in front—one fading, and the other brightening—as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road branching off to Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock—it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.  Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.  “Con-_trary_!” said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. “That for the third time, you dunce! I’m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or I’ll pull your hair!”  “Contrary, then,” answered another, in deep but softened tones. “And now, kiss me, for minding so well.”  “No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.”  The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to superintend his studies; and her face—it was lucky he could not see her face, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty.  The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw’s heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.  “I’d rayther, by th’ haulf, hev’ ’em swearing i’ my lugs fro’h morn to neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!” said the tenant of the kitchen, in answer to an unheard speech of Nelly’s. “It’s a blazing shame, that I cannot oppen t’ blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and all t’ flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th’ warld! Oh! ye’re a raight nowt; and shoo’s another; and that poor lad ’ll be lost atween ye. Poor lad!” he added, with a groan; “he’s witched: I’m sartin on’t. Oh, Lord, judge ’em, for there’s norther law nor justice among wer rullers!”  “No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,” retorted the singer. “But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and never mind me. This is ‘Fairy Annie’s Wedding’—a bonny tune—it goes to a dance.”  Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me directly, she jumped to her feet, crying—“Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood! How could you think of returning in this way? All’s shut up at Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!”  “I’ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,” I answered. “I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted here, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.”  “Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening?”  “From the Grange,” I replied; “and while they make me lodging room there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don’t think of having another opportunity in a hurry.”  “What business, sir?” said Nelly, conducting me into the house. “He’s gone out at present, and won’t return soon.”  “About the rent,” I answered.  “Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,” she observed; “or rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act for her: there’s nobody else.”  I looked surprised.  “Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff’s death, I see,” she continued.  “Heathcliff dead!” I exclaimed, astonished. “How long ago?”  “Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I’ll tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?”  “I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I never dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you don’t expect them back for some time—the young people?”  “No—I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they don’t care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you good: you seem weary.”  She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking whether “it warn’t a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o’ t’ maister’s cellar! He fair shaamed to ’bide still and see it.”  She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness. And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff’s history. He had a “queer” end, as she expressed it.  * * * * *   I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine’s sake. My first interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him—and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible—after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived—how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and dozing.  “He’s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?” she once observed, “or a cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if you do, what is it about? But you can’t speak to me!”  Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look again.  “He’s, perhaps, dreaming now,” she continued. “He twitched his shoulder as Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.”  “Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don’t behave!” I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist, as if tempted to use it.  “I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,” she exclaimed, on another occasion. “He is afraid I shall laugh at him. Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and, because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a fool?”  “Were not you naughty?” I said; “answer me that.”  “Perhaps I was,” she went on; “but I did not expect him to be so silly. Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I’ll try!”  She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.  “Well, I shall put it here,” she said, “in the table-drawer; and I’m going to bed.”  Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her great disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was useless.  Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. It suited Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business below, that she might accompany me.  On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw sat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin—“I’ve found out, Hareton, that I want—that I’m glad—that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.”  Hareton returned no answer.  “Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?” she continued.  “Get off wi’ ye!” he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.  “Let me take that pipe,” she said, cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth.  Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the fire. He swore at her and seized another.  “Stop,” she cried, “you must listen to me first; and I can’t speak while those clouds are floating in my face.”  “Will you go to the devil!” he exclaimed, ferociously, “and let me be!”  “No,” she persisted, “I won’t: I can’t tell what to do to make you talk to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you stupid, I don’t mean anything: I don’t mean that I despise you. Come, you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.”  “I shall have naught to do wi’ you and your mucky pride, and your damned mocking tricks!” he answered. “I’ll go to hell, body and soul, before I look sideways after you again. Side out o’ t’ gate, now, this minute!”  Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency to sob.  “You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,” I interrupted, “since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.”  “A companion!” he cried; “when she hates me, and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I’d not be scorned for seeking her good-will any more.”  “It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!” wept Cathy, no longer disguising her trouble. “You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and more.”  “You’re a damned liar,” began Earnshaw: “why have I made him angry, by taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at and despised me, and—Go on plaguing me, and I’ll step in yonder, and say you worried me out of the kitchen!”  “I didn’t know you took my part,” she answered, drying her eyes; “and I was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you to forgive me: what can I do besides?”  She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct, must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered—“Well! what should I have done, Ellen? He wouldn’t shake hands, and he wouldn’t look: I must show him some way that I like him—that I want to be friends.”  Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful, for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.  Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to “Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,” she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the present to its destined recipient.  “And tell him, if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him to read it right,” she said; “and, if he refuse it, I’ll go upstairs, and never tease him again.”  I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee. He did not strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured petition.  “Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking that little word.”  He muttered something inaudible.  “And you’ll be my friend?” added Catherine, interrogatively.  “Nay, you’ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,” he answered; “and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.”  “So you won’t be my friend?” she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and creeping close up.  I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.  The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home. He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder; and confounded at his favourite’s endurance of her proximity: it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day’s transactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.  “Tak’ these in to t’ maister, lad,” he said, “and bide there. I’s gang up to my own rahm. This hoile’s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we mun side out and seearch another.”  “Come, Catherine,” I said, “we must ‘side out’ too: I’ve done my ironing. Are you ready to go?”  “It is not eight o’clock!” she answered, rising unwillingly. “Hareton, I’ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I’ll bring some more to-morrow.”  “Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak’ into th’ hahse,” said Joseph, “and it’ll be mitch if yah find ’em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!”  Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as she passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps, during her earliest visits to Linton.  The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the same point—one loving and desiring to esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed—they contrived in the end to reach it.  You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff’s heart. But now, I’m glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there won’t be a happier woman than myself in England!     CHAPTER XXXIII   On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.  I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph’s eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them.  “There! That will be all shown to the master,” I exclaimed, “the minute it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head of it: see if we don’t! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!”  “I’d forgotten they were Joseph’s,” answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled; “but I’ll tell him I did it.”  We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress’s post in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility.  “Now, mind you don’t talk with and notice your cousin too much,” were my whispered instructions as we entered the room. “It will certainly annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he’ll be mad at you both.”  “I’m not going to,” she answered.  The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge.  He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh. I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.  “It is well you are out of my reach,” he exclaimed. “What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes? Down with them! and don’t remind me of your existence again. I thought I had cured you of laughing.”  “It was me,” muttered Hareton.  “What do you say?” demanded the master.  Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr. Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door, revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began:—  “I mun hev’ my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I’d sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I’d lug my books up into t’ garret, and all my bits o’ stuff, and they sud hev’ t’ kitchen to theirseln; for t’ sake o’ quietness. It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I thowt I _could_ do that! But nah, shoo’s taan my garden fro’ me, and by th’ heart, maister, I cannot stand it! Yah may bend to th’ yoak an ye will—I noan used to ’t, and an old man doesn’t sooin get used to new barthens. I’d rayther arn my bite an’ my sup wi’ a hammer in th’ road!”  “Now, now, idiot!” interrupted Heathcliff, “cut it short! What’s your grievance? I’ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.”  “It’s noan Nelly!” answered Joseph. “I sudn’t shift for Nelly—nasty ill nowt as shoo is. Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t’ sowl o’ nob’dy! Shoo wer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her ’bout winking. It’s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that’s witched our lad, wi’ her bold een and her forrard ways—till—Nay! it fair brusts my heart! He’s forgotten all I’ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up a whole row o’ t’ grandest currant-trees i’ t’ garden!” and here he lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and Earnshaw’s ingratitude and dangerous condition.  “Is the fool drunk?” asked Mr. Heathcliff. “Hareton, is it you he’s finding fault with?”  “I’ve pulled up two or three bushes,” replied the young man; “but I’m going to set ’em again.”  “And why have you pulled them up?” said the master.  Catherine wisely put in her tongue.  “We wanted to plant some flowers there,” she cried. “I’m the only person to blame, for I wished him to do it.”  “And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?” demanded her father-in-law, much surprised. “And who ordered _you_ to obey her?” he added, turning to Hareton.  The latter was speechless; his cousin replied—“You shouldn’t grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!”  “Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,” said Heathcliff.  “And my money,” she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.  “Silence!” he exclaimed. “Get done, and begone!”  “And Hareton’s land, and his money,” pursued the reckless thing. “Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!”  The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.  “If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,” she said; “so you may as well sit down.”  “If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I’ll strike him to hell,” thundered Heathcliff. “Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen! I’ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!”  Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.  “Drag her away!” he cried, savagely. “Are you staying to talk?” And he approached to execute his own command.  “He’ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,” said Catherine; “and he’ll soon detest you as much as I do.”  “Wisht! wisht!” muttered the young man, reproachfully; “I will not hear you speak so to him. Have done.”  “But you won’t let him strike me?” she cried.  “Come, then,” he whispered earnestly.  It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.  “Now, _you_ go!” he said to Earnshaw. “Accursed witch! this time she has provoked me when I could not bear it; and I’ll make her repent it for ever!”  He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks, entreating him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff’s black eyes flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed intently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine, said, with assumed calmness—“You must learn to avoid putting me in a passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I’ll send him seeking his bread where he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar. Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!”  I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner. I had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should not return before evening.  The two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her offering a revelation of her father-in-law’s conduct to his father. He said he wouldn’t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the devil, it didn’t signify; he would stand by him; and he’d rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak ill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master’s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could break—chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don’t believe she has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter’s hearing, against her oppressor since.  When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and Catherine’s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at him. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.  They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he bid me sit still.  “It is a poor conclusion, is it not?” he observed, having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed: “an absurd termination to my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where is the use? I don’t care for striking: I can’t take the trouble to raise my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.  “Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I’m in its shadow at present. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly remember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her_ I won’t speak; and I don’t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He_ moves me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I’d never see him again! You’ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so,” he added, making an effort to smile, “if I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies. But you’ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.  “Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor, but her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every tree—filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day—I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men and women—my own features—mock me with a resemblance. The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her! Well, Hareton’s aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my anguish—  “But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together. I can give them no attention any more.”  “But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?” I said, alarmed at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine.  “I shall not know that till it comes,” he said; “I’m only half conscious of it now.”  “You have no feeling of illness, have you?” I asked.  “No, Nelly, I have not,” he answered.  “Then you are not afraid of death?” I pursued.  “Afraid? No!” he replied. “I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment, nor a hope of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution and temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to remind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so unwaveringly, that I’m convinced it _will_ be reached—and _soon_—because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!”  He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would end. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.     CHAPTER XXXIV   For some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy. He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him.  One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and out at the front door. I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the influence of Joseph’s complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was coming in. “And he spoke to me,” she added, with a perplexed countenance.  “What did he say?” asked Hareton.  “He told me to begone as fast as I could,” she answered. “But he looked so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at him.”  “How?” he inquired.  “Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing—_very much_ excited, and wild, and glad!” she replied.  “Night-walking amuses him, then,” I remarked, affecting a careless manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole face.  “Will you have some breakfast?” I said. “You must be hungry, rambling about all night!” I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not like to ask directly.  “No, I’m not hungry,” he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.  I felt perplexed: I didn’t know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.  “I don’t think it right to wander out of doors,” I observed, “instead of being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I daresay you’ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the matter with you now!”  “Nothing but what I can bear,” he replied; “and with the greatest pleasure, provided you’ll leave me alone: get in, and don’t annoy me.”  I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.  “Yes!” I reflected to myself, “we shall have a fit of illness. I cannot conceive what he has been doing.”  That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.  “I’ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,” he remarked, in allusion to my morning’s speech; “and I’m ready to do justice to the food you give me.”  He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and Earnshaw said he’d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had grieved him some way.  “Well, is he coming?” cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.  “Nay,” he answered; “but he’s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.”  I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same unnatural—it was unnatural—appearance of joy under his black brows; the same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates—a strong thrilling, rather than trembling.  I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I exclaimed—“Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look uncommonly animated.”  “Where should good news come from to me?” he said. “I’m animated with hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.”  “Your dinner is here,” I returned; “why won’t you get it?”  “I don’t want it now,” he muttered, hastily: “I’ll wait till supper. And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to myself.”  “Is there some new reason for this banishment?” I inquired. “Tell me why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I’m not putting the question through idle curiosity, but—”  “You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,” he interrupted, with a laugh. “Yet I’ll answer it. Last night I was on the threshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you’d better go! You’ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from prying.”  Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed than ever.  He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on his solitude; till, at eight o’clock, I deemed it proper, though unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was turned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.  “Must I close this?” I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not stir.  The light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those deep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me, not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.  “Yes, close it,” he replied, in his familiar voice. “There, that is pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick, and bring another.”  I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph—“The master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.” For I dared not go in myself again just then.  Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he had rather we had no suspicion.  “Is he a ghoul or a vampire?” I mused. I had read of such hideous incarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror. “But where did he come from, the little dark thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?” muttered Superstition, as I dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word, “Heathcliff.” That came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you’ll read, on his headstone, only that, and the date of his death.  Dawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window. There were none. “He has stayed at home,” I thought, “and he’ll be all right to-day.” I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master came down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of doors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.  On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him. He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.  “Come now,” I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, “eat and drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.”  He didn’t notice me, and yet he smiled. I’d rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so.  “Mr. Heathcliff! master!” I cried, “don’t, for God’s sake, stare as if you saw an unearthly vision.”  “Don’t, for God’s sake, shout so loud,” he replied. “Turn round, and tell me, are we by ourselves?”  “Of course,” was my answer; “of course we are.”  Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.  Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards’ distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.  I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn’t wait: I might set the things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate.  The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He returned after midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.  I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring the floor, and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a groan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and began to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth sooner than I expected. He opened the door immediately, and said—“Nelly, come here—is it morning? Come in with your light.”  “It is striking four,” I answered. “You want a candle to take upstairs: you might have lit one at this fire.”  “No, I don’t wish to go upstairs,” he said. “Come in, and kindle _me_ a fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.”  “I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,” I replied, getting a chair and the bellows.  He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between.  “When day breaks I’ll send for Green,” he said; “I wish to make some legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to leave my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from the face of the earth.”  “I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,” I interposed. “Let your will be a while: you’ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault. The way you’ve passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.”  “It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,” he replied. “I assure you it is through no settled designs. I’ll do both, as soon as I possibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms’ length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then I’ll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices, I’ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I’m too happy; and yet I’m not happy enough. My soul’s bliss kills my body, but does not satisfy itself.”  “Happy, master?” I cried. “Strange happiness! If you would hear me without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you happier.”  “What is that?” he asked. “Give it.”  “You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,” I said, “that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one—some minister of any denomination, it does not matter which—to explain it, and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?”  “I’m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,” he said, “for you remind me of the manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor need anything be said over me.—I tell you I have nearly attained _my_ heaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.”  “And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?” I said, shocked at his godless indifference. “How would you like it?”  “They won’t do that,” he replied: “if they did, you must have me removed secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the dead are not annihilated!”  As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him. I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone.  “I believe you think me a fiend,” he said, with his dismal laugh: “something too horrible to live under a decent roof.” Then turning to Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he added, half sneeringly,—“Will _you_ come, chuck? I’ll not hurt you. No! to you I’ve made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who won’t shrink from my company! By God! she’s relentless. Oh, damn it! It’s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear—even mine.”  He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter; but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be left alone; so the doctor went away.  The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master’s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He cannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He must either be up or out. But I’ll make no more ado, I’ll go boldly and look.  Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there—laid on his back. His eyes met mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile. I could not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could doubt no more: he was dead and stark!  I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful, life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but resolutely refused to meddle with him.  “Th’ divil’s harried off his soul,” he cried, “and he may hev’ his carcass into t’ bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked ’un he looks, girning at death!” and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights.  I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.  Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not the cause.  We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished. Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had let it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds—and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks, if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this house. Idle tales, you’ll say, and so say I. Yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on ’em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:—and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one evening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just at the turn of the Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be guided.  “What is the matter, my little man?” I asked.  “There’s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t’ nab,” he blubbered, “un’ I darnut pass ’em.”  I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him take the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don’t like being out in the dark now; and I don’t like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.  “They are going to the Grange, then?” I said.  “Yes,” answered Mrs. Dean, “as soon as they are married, and that will be on New Year’s Day.”  “And who will live here then?”  “Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.”  “For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?” I observed.  “No, Mr. Lockwood,” said Nelly, shaking her head. “I believe the dead are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.”  At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.  “_They_ are afraid of nothing,” I grumbled, watching their approach through the window. “Together, they would brave Satan and all his legions.”  As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at the moon—or, more correctly, at each other by her light—I felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door; and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his fellow-servant’s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.  My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.  I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton’s only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff’s still bare.  I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.","Fiction, Classics","Emily Brontë's only novel, Wuthering Heights, is a tale of passion, revenge, and the destructive power of love.

In the Louvre     HIS BIRTH  Leonardo Da Vinci, the many-sided genius of the Italian Renaissance, was born, as his name implies, at the little town of Vinci, which is about six miles from Empoli and twenty miles west of Florence. Vinci is still very inaccessible, and the only means of conveyance is the cart of a general carrier and postman, who sets out on his journey from Empoli at sunrise and sunset. Outside a house in the middle of the main street of Vinci to-day a modern and white-washed bust of the great artist is pointed to with much pride by the inhabitants. Leonardo's traditional birthplace on the outskirts of the town still exists, and serves now as the headquarters of a farmer and small wine exporter.  Leonardo di Ser Piero d'Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser Guido da Vinci--for that was his full legal name--was the natural and first-born son of Ser Piero, a country notary, who, like his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, followed that honourable vocation with distinction and success, and who subsequently--when Leonardo was a youth--was appointed notary to the Signoria of Florence. Leonardo's mother was one Caterina, who afterwards married Accabriga di Piero del Vaccha of Vinci.  [Illustration: Plate II.--Annunciation  In the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. No. 1288. 3 ft 3 ins. By 6 ft 11 ins. (0.99 x 2.18)  Although this panel is included in the Uffizi Catalogue as being by Leonardo, it is in all probability by his master, Verrocchio.]  The date of Leonardo's birth is not known with any certainty. His age is given as five in a taxation return made in 1457 by his grandfather Antonio, in whose house he was educated; it is therefore concluded that he was born in 1452. Leonardo's father Ser Piero, who afterwards married four times, had eleven children by his third and fourth wives. Is it unreasonable to suggest that Leonardo may have had these numbers in mind in 1496-1498 when he was painting in his famous ""Last Supper"" the figures of eleven Apostles and one outcast?  However, Ser Piero seems to have legitimised his ""love child"" who very early showed promise of extraordinary talent and untiring energy.     HIS EARLY TRAINING  Practically nothing is known about Leonardo's boyhood, but Vasari informs us that Ser Piero, impressed with the remarkable character of his son's genius, took some of his drawings to Andrea del Verrocchio, an intimate friend, and begged him earnestly to express an opinion on them. Verrocchio was so astonished at the power they revealed that he advised Ser Piero to send Leonardo to study under him. Leonardo thus entered the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio about 1469-1470. In the workshop of that great Florentine sculptor, goldsmith, and artist he met other craftsmen, metal workers, and youthful painters, among whom was Botticelli, at that moment of his development a jovial _habitue_ of the Poetical Supper Club, who had not yet given any premonitions of becoming the poet, mystic, and visionary of later times. There also Leonardo came into contact with that unoriginal painter Lorenzo di Credi, his junior by seven years. He also, no doubt, met Perugino, whom Michelangelo called ""that blockhead in art."" The genius and versatility of the Vincian painter was, however, in no way dulled by intercourse with lesser artists than himself; on the contrary he vied with each in turn, and readily outstripped his fellow pupils. In 1472, at the age of twenty, he was admitted into the Guild of Florentine Painters.  Unfortunately very few of Leonardo's paintings have come down to us. Indeed there do not exist a sufficient number of finished and absolutely authentic oil pictures from his own hand to afford illustrations for this short chronological sketch of his life's work. The few that do remain, however, are of so exquisite a quality--or were until they were ""comforted"" by the uninspired restorer--that we can unreservedly accept the enthusiastic records of tradition in respect of all his works. To rightly understand the essential characteristics of Leonardo's achievements it is necessary to regard him as a scientist quite as much as an artist, as a philosopher no less than a painter, and as a draughtsman rather than a colourist. There is hardly a branch of human learning to which he did not at one time or another give his eager attention, and he was engrossed in turn by the study of architecture--the foundation-stone of all true art--sculpture, mathematics, engineering and music. His versatility was unbounded, and we are apt to regret that this many-sided genius did not realise that it is by developing his power within certain limits that the great master is revealed. Leonardo may be described as the most Universal Genius of Christian times-perhaps of all time.  [Illustration: PLATE III.-THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS  In the National Gallery. No. 1093. 6 ft. 1/2 in. h. by 3 ft 9 1/2 in. w. (1.83 x 1.15)  This picture was painted in Milan about 1495 by Ambrogio da Predis under the supervision and guidance of Leonardo da Vinci, the essential features of the composition being borrowed from the earlier ""Vierge aux Rochers,"" now in the Louvre.]     HIS EARLY WORKS  To about the year 1472 belongs the small picture of the ""Annunciation,"" now in the Louvre, which after being the subject of much contention among European critics has gradually won its way to general recognition as an early work by Leonardo himself. That it was painted in the studio of Verrocchio was always admitted, but it was long catalogued by the Louvre authorities under the name of Lorenzo di Credi. It is now, however, attributed to Leonardo (No. 1602 A). Such uncertainties as to attribution were common half a century ago when scientific art criticism was in its infancy.  Another painting of the ""Annunciation,"" which is now in the Uffizi Gallery (No. 1288) is still officially attributed to Leonardo. This small picture, which has been considerably repainted, and is perhaps by Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo's master, is the subject of Plate II.  To January 1473 belongs Leonardo's earliest dated work, a pen-and-ink drawing--""A Wide View over a Plain,"" now in the Uffizi. The inscription together with the date in the top left-hand corner is reversed, and proves a remarkable characteristic of Leonardo's handwriting--viz., that he wrote from right to left; indeed, it has been suggested that he did this in order to make it difficult for any one else to read the words, which were frequently committed to paper by the aid of peculiar abbreviations.  Leonardo continued to work in his master's studio till about 1477. On January 1st of the following year, 1478, he was commissioned to paint an altar-piece for the Chapel of St. Bernardo in the Palazzo Vecchio, and he was paid twenty-five florins on account. He, however, never carried out the work, and after waiting five years the Signoria transferred the commission to Domenico Ghirlandajo, who also failed to accomplish the task, which was ultimately, some seven years later, completed by Filippino Lippi. This panel of the ""Madonna Enthroned, St. Victor, St. John Baptist, St. Bernard, and St. Zenobius,"" which is dated February 20, 1485, is now in the Uffizi.  That Leonardo was by this time a facile draughtsman is evidenced by his vigorous pen-and-ink sketch--now in a private collection in Paris--of Bernardo Bandini, who in the Pazzi Conspiracy of April 1478 stabbed Giuliano de' Medici to death in the Cathedral at Florence during High Mass. The drawing is dated December 29, 1479, the date of Bandini's public execution in Florence.  In that year also, no doubt, was painted the early and, as might be expected, unfinished ""St. Jerome in the Desert,"" now in the Vatican, the under-painting being in umber and _terraverte_. Its authenticity is vouched for not only by the internal evidence of the picture itself, but also by the similarity of treatment seen in a drawing in the Royal Library at Windsor. Cardinal Fesch, a princely collector in Rome in the early part of the nineteenth century, found part of the picture--the torso--being used as a box-cover in a shop in Rome. He long afterwards discovered in a shoemaker's shop a panel of the head which belonged to the torso. The jointed panel was eventually purchased by Pope Pius IX., and added to the Vatican Collection.  In March 1480 Leonardo was commissioned to paint an altar-piece for the monks of St. Donato at Scopeto, for which payment in advance was made to him. That he intended to carry out this contract seems most probable. He, however, never completed the picture, although it gave rise to the supremely beautiful cartoon of the ""Adoration of the Magi,"" now in the Uffizi (No. 1252). As a matter of course it is unfinished, only the under-painting and the colouring of the figures in green on a brown ground having been executed. The rhythm of line, the variety of attitude, the profound feeling for landscape and an early application of chiaroscuro effect combine to render this one of his most characteristic productions.  Vasari tells us that while Verrocchio was painting the ""Baptism of Christ"" he allowed Leonardo to paint in one of the attendant angels holding some vestments. This the pupil did so admirably that his remarkable genius clearly revealed itself, the angel which Leonardo painted being much better than the portion executed by his master. This ""Baptism of Christ,"" which is now in the Accademia in Florence and is in a bad state of preservation, appears to have been a comparatively early work by Verrocchio, and to have been painted in 1480-1482, when Leonardo would be about thirty years of age.  To about this period belongs the superb drawing of the ""Warrior,"" now in the Malcolm Collection in the British Museum. This drawing may have been made while Leonardo still frequented the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio, who in 1479 was commissioned to execute the equestrian statue of Bartolommeo Colleoni, which was completed twenty years later and still adorns the Campo di San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice.     FIRST VISIT TO MILAN   About 1482 Leonardo entered the service of Ludovico Sforza, having first written to his future patron a full statement of his various abilities in the following terms:--  ""Having, most illustrious lord, seen and pondered over the experiments made by those who pass as masters in the art of inventing instruments of war, and having satisfied myself that they in no way differ from those in general use, I make so bold as to solicit, without prejudice to any one, an opportunity of informing your excellency of some of my own secrets.""  [Illustration: PLATE IV.-THE LAST SUPPER  Refectory of St. Maria delle Grazie, Milan. About 13 feet 8 ins. h. by 26 ft. 7 ins. w. (4.16 x 8.09)]  He goes on to say that he can construct light bridges which can be transported, that he can make pontoons and scaling ladders, that he can construct cannon and mortars unlike those commonly used, as well as catapults and other engines of war; or if the fight should take place at sea that he can build engines which shall be suitable alike for defence as for attack, while in time of peace he can erect public and private buildings. Moreover, he urges that he can also execute sculpture in marble, bronze, or clay, and, with regard to painting, ""can do as well as any one else, no matter who he may be."" In conclusion, he offers to execute the proposed bronze equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza ""which shall bring glory and never-ending honour to that illustrious house.""  It was about 1482, the probable date of Leonardo's migration from Florence to Milan, that he painted the ""Vierge aux Rochers,"" now in the Louvre (No. 1599). It is an essentially Florentine picture, and although it has no pedigree earlier than 1625, when it was in the Royal Collection at Fontainebleau, it is undoubtedly much earlier and considerably more authentic than the ""Virgin of the Rocks,"" now in the National Gallery (Plate III.).  He certainly set to work about this time on the projected statue of Francesco Sforza, but probably then made very little progress with it. He may also in that year or the next have painted the lost portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, one of the mistresses of Ludovico Sforza. It has, however, been surmised that that lady's features are preserved to us in the ""Lady with a Weasel,"" by Leonardo's pupil Boltraffio, which is now in the Czartoryski Collection at Cracow.     IN THE EAST  The absence of any record of Leonardo in Milan, or elsewhere in Italy, between 1483 and 1487 has led critics to the conclusion, based on documentary evidence of a somewhat complicated nature, that he spent those years in the service of the Sultan of Egypt, travelling in Armenia and the East as his engineer.    BACK IN MILAN   In 1487 he was again resident in Milan as general artificer--using that term in its widest sense--to Ludovico. Among his various activities at this period must be mentioned the designs he made for the cupola of the cathedral at Milan, and the scenery he constructed for ""Il Paradiso,"" which was written by Bernardo Bellincioni on the occasion of the marriage of Gian Galeazzo with Isabella of Aragon. About 1489-1490 he began his celebrated ""Treatise on Painting"" and recommenced work on the colossal equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza, which was doubtless the greatest of all his achievements as a sculptor. It was, however, never cast in bronze, and was ruthlessly destroyed by the French bowmen in April 1500, on their occupation of Milan after the defeat of Ludovico at the battle of Novara. This is all the more regrettable as no single authentic piece of sculpture has come down to us from Leonardo's hand, and we can only judge of his power in this direction from his drawings, and the enthusiastic praise of his contemporaries.  [Illustration: PLATE V.--COPY OF THE LAST SUPPER  In the Diploma Gallery, Burlington House  This copy is usually ascribed to Marco d'Oggiono, but some critics claim that it is by Gianpetrino. It is the same size as the original.]    THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS   The ""Virgin of the Rocks"" (Plate III.), now in the National Gallery, corresponds exactly with a painting by Leonardo which was described by Lomazzo about 1584 as being in the Chapel of the Conception in the Church of St. Francesco at Milan. This picture, the only _oeuvre_ in this gallery with which Leonardo's name can be connected, was brought to England in 1777 by Gavin Hamilton, and sold by him to the Marquess of Lansdowne, who subsequently exchanged it for another picture in the Collection of the Earl of Suffolk at Charlton Park, Wiltshire, from whom it was eventually purchased by the National Gallery for L9000. Signor Emilio Motta, some fifteen years ago, unearthed in the State Archives of Milan a letter or memorial from Giovanni Ambrogio da Predis and Leonardo da Vinci to the Duke of Milan, praying him to intervene in a dispute, which had arisen between the petitioners and the Brotherhood of the Conception, with regard to the valuation of certain works of art furnished for the chapel of the Brotherhood in the church of St. Francesco. The only logical deduction which can be drawn from documentary evidence is that the ""Vierge aux Rochers"" in the Louvre is the picture, painted about 1482, which between 1491 and 1494 gave rise to the dispute, and that, when it was ultimately sold by the artists for the full price asked to some unknown buyer, the National Gallery version was executed for a smaller price mainly by Ambrogio da Predisunder the supervision, and with the help, of Leonardo to be placed in the Chapel of the Conception.  The differences between the earlier, the more authentic, and the more characteristically Florentine ""Vierge aux Rochers,"" in the Louvre, and the ""Virgin of the Rocks,"" in the National Gallery, are that in the latter picture the hand of the angel, seated by the side of the Infant Christ, is raised and pointed in the direction of the little St. John the Baptist; that the St John has a reed cross and the three principal figures have gilt nimbi, which were, however, evidently added much later. In the National Gallery version the left hand of the Madonna, the Christ's right hand and arm, and the forehead of St. John the Baptist are freely restored, while a strip of the foreground right across the whole picture is ill painted and lacks accent. The head of the angel is, however, magnificently painted, and by Leonardo; the panel, taken as a whole, is exceedingly beautiful and full of charm and tenderness.     THE LAST SUPPER  Between 1496 and 1498 Leonardo painted his _chef d'oeuvre_, the ""Last Supper,"" (Plate IV.) for the end wall of the Refectory of the Dominican Convent of S. Maria delle Grazie at Milan. It was originally executed in tempera on a badly prepared stucco ground and began to deteriorate a very few years after its completion. As early as 1556 it was half ruined. In 1652 the monks cut away a part of the fresco including the feet of the Christ to make a doorway. In 1726 one Michelangelo Belotti, an obscure Milanese painter, received L300 for the worthless labour he bestowed on restoring it. He seems to have employed some astringent restorative which revived the colours temporarily, and then left them in deeper eclipse than before. In 1770 the fresco was again restored by Mazza. In 1796 Napoleon's cavalry, contrary to his express orders, turned the refectory into a stable, and pelted the heads of the figures with dirt. Subsequently the refectory was used to store hay, and at one time or another it has been flooded. In 1820 the fresco was again restored, and in 1854 this restoration was effaced. In October 1908 Professor Cavenaghi completed the delicate task of again restoring it, and has, in the opinion of experts, now preserved it from further injury. In addition, the devices of Ludovico and his Duchess and a considerable amount of floral decoration by Leonardo himself have been brought to light.  Leonardo has succeeded in producing the effect of the _coup de theatre_ at the moment when Jesus said ""One of you shall betray me."" Instantly the various apostles realise that there is a traitor among their number, and show by their different gestures their different passions, and reveal their different temperaments. On the left of Christ is St. John who is overcome with grief and is interrogated by the impetuous Peter, near whom is seated Judas Iscariot who, while affecting the calm of innocence, is quite unable to conceal his inner feelings; he instinctively clasps the money-bag and in so doing upsets the salt-cellar.  It will be remembered that the Prior of the Convent complained to Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, that Leonardo was taking too long to paint the fresco and was causing the Convent considerable inconvenience. Leonardo had his revenge by threatening to paint the features of the impatient Prior into the face of  Judas Iscariot. The incident has been quaintly told in the following lines:--    ""Padre Bandelli, then, complains of me   Because, forsooth, I have not drawn a line   Upon the Saviour's head; perhaps, then, he   Could without trouble paint that head divine.   But think, oh Signor Duca, what should be   The pure perfection of Our Saviour's face--   What sorrowing majesty, what noble grace,   At that dread moment when He brake the bread,   And those submissive words of pathos said:    ""'By one among you I shall be betrayed,'--   And say if 'tis an easy task to find   Even among the best that walk this Earth,   The fitting type of that divinest worth,   That has its image solely in the mind.   Vainly my pencil struggles to express   The sorrowing grandeur of such holiness.   In patient thought, in ever-seeking prayer,   I strive to shape that glorious face within,   But the soul's mirror, dulled and dimmed by sin,   Reflects not yet the perfect image there.   Can the hand do before the soul has wrought;   Is not our art the servant of our thought?    ""And Judas too, the basest face I see,   Will not contain his utter infamy;   Among the dregs and offal of mankind   Vainly I seek an utter wretch to find.   He who for thirty silver coins could sell   His Lord, must be the Devil's miracle.   Padre Bandelli thinks it easy is   To find the type of him who with a kiss   Betrayed his Lord. Well, what I can I'll do;   And if it please his reverence and you,   For Judas' face I'm willing to paint his.""         *       *       *       *       *    ""... I dare not paint   Till all is ordered and matured within,   Hand-work and head-work have an earthly taint,   But when the soul commands I shall begin;   On themes like these I should not dare to dwell   With our good Prior--they to him would be   Mere nonsense; he must touch and taste and see,   And facts, he says, are never mystical.""  [Illustration: PLATE VI.--THE HEAD OF CHRIST  In the Brera Gallery, Milan. No. 280. 1 ft. 0-1/2 ins. by 1 ft. 4 ins. (0.32 x 0.40)]  The copy of the ""Last Supper"" (Plate V.) by Marco d'Oggiono, now in the Diploma Gallery at Burlington House, was made shortly after the original painting was completed. It gives but a faint echo of that sublime work ""in which the ideal and the real were blended in perfect unity."" This copy was long in the possession of the Carthusians in their Convent at Pavia, and, on the suppression of that Order and the sale of their effects in 1793, passed into the possession of a grocer at Milan. It was subsequently purchased for L600 by the Royal Academy on the advice of Sir Thomas Lawrence, who left no stone unturned to acquire also the original studies for the heads of the Apostles. Some of these in red and black chalk are now preserved in the Royal Library at Windsor, where there are in all 145 drawings by Leonardo.  Several other old copies of the fresco exist, notably the one in the Louvre. Francis I. wished to remove the whole wall of the Refectory to Paris, but he was persuaded that that would be impossible; the Constable de Montmorency then had a copy made for the Chapel of the Chateau d'Ecouen, whence it ultimately passed to the Louvre.  The singularly beautiful ""Head of Christ"" (Plate VI.), now in the Brera Gallery at Milan, is the original study for the head of the principal figure in the fresco painting of the ""Last Supper."" In spite of decay and restoration it expresses ""the most elevated seriousness together with Divine Gentleness, pain on account of the faithlessness of His disciples, a full presentiment of His own death, and resignation to the will of His Father.""    THE COURT OF MILAN  Ludovico, to whom Leonardo was now court-painter, had married Beatrice d'Este, in 1491, when she was only fifteen years of age. The young Duchess, who at one time owned as many as eighty-four splendid gowns, refused to wear a certain dress of woven gold, which her husband had given her, if Cecilia Gallerani, the Sappho of her day, continued to wear a very similar one, which presumably had been given to her by Ludovico. Having discarded Cecilia, who, as her tastes did not lie in the direction of the Convent, was married in 1491 to Count Ludovico Bergamini, the Duke in 1496 became enamoured of Lucrezia Crivelli, a lady-in-waiting to the Duchess Beatrice.  Leonardo, as court painter, perhaps painted a portrait, now lost, of Lucrezia, whose features are more likely to be preserved to us in the portrait by Ambrogio da Predis, now in the Collection of the Earl of Roden, than in the quite unauthenticated portrait (Plate VII.), now in the Louvre (No. 1600).  On January 2, 1497, Beatrice spent three hours in prayer in the church of St. Maria delle Grazie, and the same night gave birth to a stillborn child. In a few hours she passed away, and from that moment Ludovico was a changed man. He went daily to see her tomb, and was quite overcome with grief.  In April 1498, Isabella d'Este, Beatrice's elder, more beautiful, and more graceful sister, ""at the sound of whose name all the muses rise and do reverence"" wrote to Cecilia Gallerani, or Bergamini, asking her to lend her the portrait which Leonardo had painted of her some fifteen years earlier, as she wished to compare it with a picture by Giovanni Bellini. Cecilia graciously lent the picture--now presumably lost--adding her regret that it no longer resembled her.    LEONARDO LEAVES MILAN  Among the last of Leonardo da Vinci's works in Milan towards the end of 1499 was, probably, the superb cartoon of ""The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John,"" now at Burlington House. Though little known to the general public, this large drawing on _carton_, or stiff paper, is one of the greatest of London's treasures, as it reveals the sweeping line of Leonardo's powerful draughtsmanship. It was in the Pompeo Leoni, Arconati, Casnedi, and Udney Collections before passing to the Royal Academy.  In 1499 the stormy times in Milan foreboded the end of Ludovico's reign. In April of that year we read of his giving a vineyard to Leonardo; in September Ludovico had to leave Milan for the Tyrol to raise an army, and on the 14th of the same month the city was sold by Bernardino di Corte to the French, who occupied it from 1500 to 1512. Ludovico may well have had in mind the figure of the traitor in the ""Last Supper"" when he declared that ""Since the days of Judas Iscariot there has never been so black a traitor as Bernardino di Corte."" On October 6th Louis XII. entered the city. Before the end of the year Leonardo, realising the necessity for his speedy departure, sent six hundred gold florins by letter of exchange to Florence to be placed to his credit with the hospital of S. Maria Nuova.  In the following year, Ludovico having been defeated at Novara, Leonardo was a homeless wanderer. He left Milan for Mantua, where he drew a portrait in chalk of Isabella d'Este, which is now in the Louvre. Leonardo eventually arrived in Florence about Easter 1500. After apparently working there in 1501 on a second Cartoon, similar in most respects to the one he had executed in Milan two years earlier, he travelled in Umbria, visiting Orvieto, Pesaro, Rimini, and other towns, acting as engineer and architect to Cesare Borgia, for whom he planned a navigable canal between Cesena and Porto Cese-natico.  [Illustration: PLATE VII.-PORTRAIT (PRESUMED) OF LUCREZIA CRIVELLI  In the Louvre. No. 1600 [483]. 2 ft by I ft 5 ins. (0.62 x 0.44)  This picture, although officially attributed to Leonardo, is probably not by him, and almost certainly does not represent Lucrezia Crivelli. It was once known as a ""Portrait of a Lady"" and is still occasionally miscalled ""La Belle Feronniere.""]    MONA LISA  Early in 1503 he was back again in Florence, and set to work in earnest on the ""Portrait of Mona Lisa"" (Plate I.), now in the Louvre (No. 1601). Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini was the daughter of Antonio Gherardini. In 1495 she married Francesco di Bartolommeo de Zenobi del Giocondo. It is from the surname of her husband that she derives the name of ""La Joconde,"" by which her portrait is officially known in the Louvre. Vasari is probably inaccurate in saying that Leonardo ""loitered over it for four years, and finally left it unfinished."" He may have begun it in the spring of 1501 and, probably owing to having taken service under Cesare Borgia in the following year, put it on one side, ultimately completing it after working on the ""Battle of Anghiari"" in 1504. Vasari's eulogy of this portrait may with advantage be quoted: ""Whoever shall desire to see how far art can imitate nature may do so to perfection in this head, wherein every peculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost subtlety of the pencil has been faithfully reproduced. The eyes have the lustrous brightness and moisture which is seen in life, and around them are those pale, red, and slightly livid circles, also proper to nature. The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils, might be easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, has the lips uniting the rose-tints of their colour with those of the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood. He who looks earnestly at the pit of the throat cannot but believe that he sees the beating of the pulses. Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while Leonardo was painting her portrait, he took the precaution of keeping some one constantly near her to sing or play on instruments, or to jest and otherwise amuse her.""  Leonardo painted this picture in the full maturity of his talent, and, although it is now little more than a monochrome owing to the free and merciless restoration to which it has been at times subjected, it must have created a wonderful impression on those who saw it in the early years of the sixteenth century. It is difficult for the unpractised eye to-day to form any idea of its original beauty. Leonardo has here painted this worldly-minded woman--her portrait is much more famous than she herself ever was--with a marvellous charm and suavity, a finesse of expression never reached before and hardly ever equalled since. Contrast the head of the Christ at Milan, Leonardo's conception of divinity expressed in perfect humanity, with the subtle and sphinx-like smile of this languorous creature.  The landscape background, against which Mona Lisa is posed, recalls the severe, rather than exuberant, landscape and the dim vistas of mountain ranges seen in the neighbourhood of his own birthplace. The portrait was bought during the reign of Francis I. for a sum which is to-day equal to about L1800. Leonardo, by the way, does not seem to have been really affected by any individual affection for any woman, and, like Michelangelo and Raphael, never married.  In January 4, 1504, Leonardo was one of the members of the Committee of Artists summoned to advise the Signoria as to the most suitable site for the erection of Michelangelo's statue of ""David,"" which had recently been completed.     BATTLE OF ANGHIARI  In the following May he was commissioned by the Signoria to decorate one of the walls of the Council Hall of the Palazzo Vecchio. The subject he selected was the ""Battle of Anghiari."" Although he completed the cartoon, the only part of the composition which he eventually executed in colour was an incident in the foreground which dealt with the ""Battle of the Standard."" One of the many supposed copies of a study of this mural painting now hangs on the south-east staircase in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It depicts the Florentines under Cardinal Ludovico Mezzarota Scarampo fighting against the Milanese under Niccolo Piccinino, the General of Filippo Maria Visconti, on June 29, 1440.    AGAIN IN MILAN  Leonardo was back in Milan in May 1506 in the service of the French King, for whom he executed, apparently with the help of assistants, ""the Madonna, the Infant Christ, and Saint Anne"" (Plate VIII.). The composition of this oil-painting seems to have been built up on the second cartoon, which he had made some eight years earlier, and which was apparently taken to France in 1516 and ultimately lost.    IN ROME  From 1513-1515 he was in Rome, where Giovanni de' Medici had been elected Pope under the title of Leo X. He did not, however, work for the Pope, although he resided in the Vatican, his time being occupied in studying acoustics, anatomy, optics, geology, minerals, engineering, and geometry!    IN FRANCE  At last in 1516, three years before his death, Leonardo left his native land for France, where he received from Francis I. a princely income. His powers, however, had already begun to fail, and he produced very little in the country of his adoption. It is, nevertheless, only in the Louvre that his achievements as a painter can to-day be adequately studied.  [Illustration: PLATE VIII.-MADONNA, INFANT CHRIST, AND ST. ANNE  In the Louvre. No. 1508. 5 ft. 7 in. h. by 4 ft. 3 in. w. (1.70 x 1.29)  Painted between 1509 and 1516 with the help of assistants.]  On October 10, 1516, when he was resident at the Manor House of Cloux near Amboise in Touraine with Francesco Melzi, his friend and assistant, he showed three of his pictures to the Cardinal of Aragon, but his right hand was now paralysed, and he could ""no longer colour with that sweetness with which he was wont, although still able to make drawings and to teach others.""  It was no doubt in these closing years of his life that he drew the ""Portrait of Himself"" in red chalk, now at Turin, which is probably the only authentic portrait of him in existence.    HIS DEATH  On April 23, 1519--Easter Eve--exactly forty-five years before the birth of Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci made his will, and on May 2 of the same year he passed away.  Vasari informs us that Leonardo, ""having become old, lay sick for many months, and finding himself near death and being sustained in the arms of his servants and friends, devoutly received the Holy Sacrament. He was then seized with a paroxysm, the forerunner of death, when King Francis I., who was accustomed frequently and affectionately to visit him, rose and supported his head to give him such assistance and to do him such favour as he could in the hope of alleviating his sufferings. The spirit of Leonardo, which was most divine, conscious that he could attain to no greater honour, departed in the arms of the monarch, being at that time in the seventy-fifth year of his age."" The not over-veracious chronicler, however, is here drawing largely upon his imagination. Leonardo was only sixty-seven years of age, and the King was in all probability on that date at St. Germain-en Laye!  Thus died ""Mr. Lionard de Vincy, the noble Milanese, painter, engineer, and architect to the King, State Mechanician"" and ""former Professor of Painting to the Duke of Milan.""  ""May God Almighty grant him His eternal peace,"" wrote his friend and assistant Francesco Melzi. ""Every one laments the loss of a man whose like Nature cannot produce a second time.""    HIS ART  Leonardo, whose birth antedates that of Michelangelo and Raphael by twenty three and thirty-one years respectively, was thus in the forefront of the Florentine Renaissance, his life coinciding almost exactly with the best period of Tuscan painting.  Leonardo was the first to investigate scientifically and to apply to art the laws of light and shade, though the preliminary investigations of Piero della Francesca deserve to be recorded.  He observed with strict accuracy the subtleties of chiaroscuro--light and shade apart from colour; but, as one critic has pointed out, his gift of chiaroscuro cost the colour-life of many a noble picture. Leonardo was ""a tonist, not a colourist,"" before whom the whole book of nature lay open.  It was not instability of character but versatility of mind which caused him to undertake many things that having commenced he afterwards abandoned, and the probability is that as soon as he saw exactly how he could solve any difficulty which presented itself, he put on one side the merely perfunctory execution of such a task.  In the Forster collection in the Victoria and Albert museum three of Leonardo's note-books with sketches are preserved, and it is stated that it was his practice to carry about with him, attached to his girdle, a little book for making sketches. They prove that he was left-handed and wrote from right to left.     HIS MIND  We can readily believe the statements of Benvenuto Cellini, the sixteenth-century Goldsmith, that Francis I. ""did not believe that any other man had come into the world who had attained so great a knowledge as Leonardo, and that not only as sculptor, painter, and architect, for beyond that he was a profound philosopher."" It was Cellini also who contended that ""Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael are the Book of the World.""  Leonardo anticipated many eminent scientists and inventors in the methods of investigation which they adopted to solve the many problems with which their names are coupled. Among these may be cited Copernicus' theory of the earth's movement, Lamarck's classification of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, the laws of friction, the laws of combustion and respiration, the elevation of the continents, the laws of gravitation, the undulatory theory of light and heat, steam as a motive power in navigation, flying machines, the invention of the camera obscura, magnetic attraction, the use of the stone saw, the system of canalisation, breech loading cannon, the construction of fortifications, the circulation of the blood, the swimming belt, the wheelbarrow, the composition of explosives, the invention of paddle wheels, the smoke stack, the mincing machine! It is, therefore, easy to see why he called ""Mechanics the Paradise of the Sciences.""  Leonardo was a SUPERMAN.     HIS MAXIMS       The eye is the window of the soul.      Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.      The natural desire of good men is knowledge.      A beautiful body perishes, but a work of art dies not.      Every difficulty can be overcome by effort.      Time abides long enough for those who make use of it.      Miserable men, how often do you enslave yourselves     to gain money!     HIS SPELL  The influence of Leonardo was strongly felt in Milan, where he spent so many of the best years of his life and founded a School of painting. He was a close observer of the gradation and reflex of light, and was capable of giving to his discoveries a practical and aesthetic form. His strong personal character and the fascination of his genius enthralled his followers, who were satisfied to repeat his types, to perpetuate the ""grey-hound eye,"" and to make use of his little devices. Among this group of painters may be mentioned Boltraffio, who perhaps painted the ""Presumed Portrait of Lucrezia Crivelli"" (Plate VII.), which is officially attributed in the Louvre to the great master himself.     HIS DESCENDANTS   Signor Uzielli has shown that one Tommaso da Vinci, a descendant of Domenico (one of Leonardo's brothers), was a few years ago a peasant at Bottinacio near Montespertoli, and had then in his possession the family papers, which now form part of the archives of the Accademia dei Lincei at Rome. It was proved also that Tommaso had given his eldest son ""the glorious name of Leonardo.""","Biography & Autobiography, Art","Walter Isaacson's biography delves into the life of Leonardo da Vinci, exploring his extraordinary achievements in art, science, engineering, and anatomy.

CHAPTER ONE.  THE BAY OF BISCAY.  It was in the latter part of the month of June, of the year seventeen hundred and ninety something, that the angry waves of the Bay of Biscay were gradually subsiding, after a gale of wind as violent as it was unusual during that period of the year.  Still they rolled heavily; and, at times, the wind blew up in fitful, angry gusts, as if it would fain renew the elemental combat; but each effort was more feeble, and the dark clouds which had been summoned to the storm, now fled in every quarter before the powerful rays of the sun, who burst their masses asunder with a glorious flood of light and heat; and, as he poured down his resplendent beams, piercing deep into the waters of that portion of the Atlantic to which we now refer, with the exception of one object, hardly visible, as at creation, there was a vast circumference of water, bounded by the fancied canopy of heaven.  We have said, with the exception of one object; for in the centre of this picture, so simple, yet so sublime, composed of the three great elements, there was a remnant of the fourth.  We say a remnant, for it was but the hull of a vessel, dismasted, water-logged, its upper works only floating occasionally above the waves, when a transient repose from their still violent undulation permitted it to reassume its buoyancy.  But this was seldom; one moment it was deluged by the seas, which broke as they poured over its gunwale; and the next, it rose from its submersion, as the water escaped from the portholes at its sides.  How many thousands of vessels--how many millions of property--have been abandoned, and eventually consigned to the all-receiving depths of the ocean, through ignorance or through fear!  What a mine of wealth must lie buried in its sands! what riches lie entangled amongst its rocks, or remain suspended in its unfathomable gulf, where the compressed fluid is equal in gravity to that which it encircles, there to remain secured in its embedment from corruption and decay, until the destruction of the universe and the return of chaos!--Yet, immense as the accumulated loss may be, the major part of it has been occasioned from an ignorance of one of the first laws of nature, that of specific gravity.  The vessel to which we have referred was, to all appearance, in a situation of as extreme hazard as that of a drowning man clinging to a single rope-yarn; yet, in reality, she was more secure from descending to the abyss below than many gallantly careering on the waters, their occupants dismissing all fear, and only calculating upon a quick arrival into port.  The _Circassian_ had sailed from New Orleans, a gallant and well-appointed ship, with a cargo, the major part of which consisted of cotton.  The captain was, in the usual acceptation of the term, a good sailor; the crew were hardy and able seamen.  As they crossed the Atlantic, they had encountered the gale to which we have referred, were driven down into the Bay of Biscay, where, as we shall hereafter explain, the vessel was dismasted, and sprang a leak, which baffled all their exertions to keep under.  It was now five days since the frightened crew had quitted the vessel in two of her boats, one of which had swamped, and every soul that occupied it had perished; the fate of the other was uncertain.  We said that the crew had deserted the vessel, but we did not assert that every existing being had been removed out of her.  Had such been the case, we should not have taken up the reader's time in describing inanimate matter.  It is life that we portray, and life there still was in the shattered hull thus abandoned to the mockery of the ocean.  In the _caboose_ of the _Circassian_, that is, in the cooking-house secured on deck, and which fortunately had been so well fixed as to resist the force of the breaking waves, remained three beings--a man, a woman, and a child.  The two first mentioned were of that inferior race which have, for so long a period, been procured from the sultry Afric coast, to toil, but reap not for themselves; the child which lay at the breast of the female was of European blood, now, indeed, deadly pale, as it attempted in vain to draw sustenance from its exhausted nurse, down whose sable cheeks the tears coursed, as she occasionally pressed the infant to her breast, and turned it round to leeward to screen it from the spray which dashed over them at each returning swell.  Indifferent to all else, save her little charge, she spoke not, although she shuddered with the cold as the water washed her knees each time that the hull was careened into the wave.  Cold and terror had produced a change in her complexion, which now wore a yellow, or sort of copper hue.  The male, who was her companion, sat opposite to her upon the iron range which once had been the receptacle of light and heat, but was now but a weary seat to a drenched and worn-out wretch.  He, too, had not spoken for many hours; with the muscles of his face relaxed, his thick lips pouting far in advance of his collapsed cheeks, his high cheekbones prominent as budding horns, his eyes displaying little but their whites, he appeared to be an object of greater misery than the female, whose thoughts were directed to the infant and not unto herself.  Yet his feelings were still acute, although his faculties appeared to be deadened by excess of suffering.  ""Eh, me!"" cried the negro woman faintly, after a long silence, her head falling back with extreme exhaustion.  Her companion made no reply, but, roused at the sound of her voice, bent forward, slided open the door a little, and looked out to windward.  The heavy spray dashed into his glassy eyes, and obscured his vision; he groaned, and fell back into his former position.  ""What you tink, Coco?"" inquired the negress, covering up more carefully the child, as she bent her head down upon it.  A look of despair, and a shudder from cold and hunger, were the only reply.  It was then about eight o'clock in the morning, and the swell of the ocean was fast subsiding.  At noon the warmth of the sun was communicated to them through the planks of the _caboose_, while its rays poured a small stream of vivid light through the chinks of the closed panels.  The negro appeared gradually to revive; at last he rose, and with some difficulty contrived again to slide open the door.  The sea had gradually decreased its violence, and but occasionally broke over the vessel; carefully holding on by the door-jambs, Coco gained the outside, that he might survey the horizon.  ""What you see, Coco?"" said the female, observing from the _caboose_ that his eyes were fixed upon a certain quarter.  ""So help me God, me tink me see something; but ab so much salt water in um eye, me no see clear,"" replied Coco, rubbing away the salt which had crystallised on his face during the morning.  ""What you tink um like, Coco?""  ""Only one bit cloud,"" replied he, entering the _caboose_, and resuming his seat upon the grate with a heavy sigh.  ""Eh, me!"" cried the negress, who had uncovered the child to look at it, and whose powers were sinking fast.  ""Poor lilly Massa Eddard, him look very bad indeed--him die very soon, me fear.  Look, Coco, no ab breath.""  The child's head fell back upon the breast of its nurse, and life appeared to be extinct.  ""Judy, you no ab milk for piccaninny; suppose um ab no milk, how can live?  Eh! stop, Judy, me put lilly fingers in um mouth; suppose Massa Eddard no dead, him pull.""  Coco inserted his finger into the child's mouth, and felt a slight drawing pressure.  ""Judy,"" cried Coco, ""Massa Eddard no dead yet.  Try now, suppose you ab lilly drop oder side.""  Poor Judy shook her head mournfully, and a tear rolled down her cheek; she was aware that nature was exhausted.  ""Coco,"" said she, wiping her cheek with the back of her hand, ""me give me heart blood for Massa Eddard; but no ab milk--all gone.""  This forcible expression of love for the child, which was used by Judy, gave an idea to Coco.  He drew his knife out of his pocket, and very coolly sawed to the bone of his fore-finger.  The blood flowed and trickled down to the extremity, which he applied to the mouth of the infant.  ""See, Judy, Massa Eddard suck--him not dead,"" cried Coco, chuckling at the fortunate result of the experiment, and forgetting at the moment their almost hopeless situation.  The child, revived by the strange sustenance, gradually recovered its powers, and in a few minutes it pulled at the finger with a certain degree of vigour.  ""Look Judy, how Massa Eddard take it,"" continued Coco.  ""Pull away, Massa Eddard, pull away.  Coco ab ten finger, and take long while suck em all dry.""  But the child was soon satisfied, and fell asleep in the arms of Judy.  ""Coco, suppose you go see again,"" observed Judy.  The negro again crawled out, and again he scanned the horizon.  ""So help me God, dis time me tink, Judy--yes, so help me God, me see a ship!"" cried Coco, joyfully.  ""Eh!"" screamed Judy, faintly, with delight: ""den Massa Eddard no die.""  ""Yes, so help me God--he come dis way!"" and Coco, who appeared to have recovered a portion of his former strength and activity, clambered on the top of the _caboose_, where he sat, cross-legged, waving his yellow handkerchief, with the hope of attracting the attention of those on board; for he knew that it was very possible that an object floating little more than level with the water's surface might escape notice.  As it fortunately happened, the frigate, for such she was, continued her course precisely for the wreck, although it had not been perceived by the look-out men at the mast-heads, whose eyes had been directed to the line of the horizon.  In less than an hour our little party were threatened with a new danger, that of being run over by the frigate, which was now within a cable's length of them, driving the seas before her in one widely extended foam, as she pursued her rapid and impetuous course.  Coco shouted to his utmost, and fortunately attracted the notice of the men who were on the bowsprit, stowing away the foretopmast-staysail, which had been hoisted up to dry after the gale.  ""Starboard, hard!"" was roared out.  ""Starboard it is,"" was the reply from the quarterdeck, and the helm was shifted without inquiry, as it always is on board of a man-of-war, although, at the same time, it behoves people to be rather careful how they pass such an order, without being prepared with a subsequent and most satisfactory explanation.  The topmast studding-sail flapped and fluttered, the foresail shivered, and the jib filled as the frigate rounded to, narrowly missing the wreck, which was now under the bows, rocking so violently in the white foam of the agitated waters, that it was with difficulty that Coco could, by clinging to the stump of the mainmast, retain his elevated position.  The frigate shortened sail, hove to, and lowered down a quarter-boat, and in less than five minutes Coco, Judy, and the infant, were rescued from their awful situation.  Poor Judy, who had borne up against all for the sake of the child, placed it in the arms of the officer who relieved them, and then fell back in a state of insensibility, in which condition she was carried on board.  Coco, as he took his place in the stern-sheets of the boat, gazed wildly round him, and then broke out into peals of extravagant laughter, which continued without intermission, and were the only replies which he could give to the interrogatories of the quarter-deck, until he fell down in a swoon, and was entrusted to the care of the surgeon.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE BACHELOR.  On the evening of the same day on which the child and the two negroes had been saved from the wreck by the fortunate appearance of the frigate, Mr Witherington, of Finsbury Square, was sitting alone in his dining-room wondering what could have become of the _Circassian_, and why he had not received intelligence of her arrival.  Mr Witherington, as we said before, was alone; he had his port and his sherry before him; and although the weather was rather warm, there was a small fire in the grate, because, as Mr Witherington asserted, it looked comfortable. Mr Witherington having watched the ceiling of the room for some time, although there was certainly nothing new to be discovered, filled another glass of wine, and then proceeded to make himself more comfortable by unbuttoning three more buttons of his waistcoat, pushing his wig further off his head, and casting loose all the buttons at the knees of his breeches; he completed his arrangements by dragging towards him two chairs within his reach, putting his legs on one, while he rested his arm on the other.  And why was not Mr Witherington to make himself comfortable?  He had good health, a good conscience, and eight thousand a-year.  Satisfied with all his little arrangements, Mr Witherington sipped his port wine, and putting down his glass again, fell back in his chair, placed his hands on his breast, interwove his fingers; and in this most comfortable position recommenced his speculations as to the non-arrival of the _Circassian_.  We will leave him to his cogitations while we introduce him more particularly to our readers.  The father of Mr Witherington was a younger son of one of the oldest and proudest families in the West Riding of Yorkshire: he had his choice of the four professions allotted to younger sons whose veins are filled with patrician blood--the army, the navy, the law, and the church.  The army did not suit him, he said, as marching and counter-marching were not comfortable; the navy did not suit him, as there was little comfort in gales of wind and mouldy biscuit: the law did not suit him, as he was not sure that he would be at ease with his conscience, which would not be comfortable; the church was also rejected, as it was, with him, connected with the idea of a small stipend, hard duty, a wife and eleven children, which were anything but comfortable.  Much to the horror of his family he eschewed all the liberal professions, and embraced the offer of an old backslider of an uncle, who proposed to him a situation in his banking-house, and a partnership as soon as he deserved it; the consequence was, that his relations bade him an indignant farewell, and then made no further inquiries about him: he was as decidedly cut as one of the female branches of the family would have been had she committed a _faux pas_.  Nevertheless, Mr Witherington senior stuck diligently to his business, in a few years was partner, and, at the death of the old gentleman, his uncle, found himself in possession of a good property, and every year coining money at his bank.  Mr Witherington senior then purchased a house in Finsbury Square, and thought it advisable to look out for a wife.  Having still much of the family pride in his composition, he resolved not to muddle the blood of the Witheringtons by any cross from Cateaton Street or Mincing Lane; and, after a proper degree of research, he selected the daughter of a Scotch earl, who went to London with a bevy of nine in a Leith smack to barter blood for wealth.  Mr Witherington being so unfortunate as to be the first comer, had the pick of the nine ladies by courtesy; his choice was light-haired, blue-eyed, a little freckled, and very tall, by no means bad-looking, and standing on the list in the family Bible, Number Four.  From this union Mr Witherington had issue; first, a daughter, christened Moggy, whom we shall soon have to introduce to our readers as a spinster of forty-seven; and second, Antony Alexander Witherington Esquire, whom we just now have left in a very comfortable position, and in a very brown study.  Mr Witherington senior persuaded his son to enter the banking-house, and, as a dutiful son, he entered it every day; but he did nothing more, having made the fortunate discovery that ""his father was born before him;"" or, in other words, that his father had plenty of money, and would be necessitated to leave it behind him.  As Mr Witherington senior had always studied comfort, his son had early imbibed the same idea, and carried his feelings, in that respect, to a much greater excess; he divided things into comfortable and uncomfortable.  One fine day, Lady Mary Witherington, after paying all the household bills, paid the debt of Nature; that is, she died: her husband paid the undertaker's bill, so it is to be presumed that she was buried.  Mr Witherington senior shortly afterwards had a stroke of apoplexy, which knocked him down.  Death, who has no feelings of honour, struck him when down.  And Mr Witherington, after having laid a few days in bed, was by a second stroke laid in the same vault as Lady Mary Witherington: and Mr Witherington junior (our Mr Witherington) after deducting 40,000 pounds for his sister's fortune, found himself in possession of a clear 8,000 pounds per annum, and an excellent house in Finsbury Square.  Mr Witherington considered this a comfortable income, and he therefore retired altogether from business.  During the lifetime of his parents he had been witness to one or two matrimonial scenes, which had induced him to put down matrimony as one of the things not comfortable: therefore he remained a bachelor.  His sister Moggy also remained unmarried; but whether it was from a very unprepossessing squint which deterred suitors, or from the same dislike to matrimony as her brother had imbibed, it is not in our power to say. Mr Witherington was three years younger than his sister; and although he had for some time worn a wig, it was only because he considered it more comfortable.  Mr Witherington's whole character might be summed up in two words--eccentricity and benevolence: eccentric he certainly was, as most bachelors usually are.  Man is but a rough pebble without the attrition received from contact with the gentler sex: it is wonderful how the ladies pumice a man down to a smoothness which occasions him to roll over and over with the rest of his species, jostling but not wounding his neighbours, as the waves of circumstances bring him into collision with them.  Mr Witherington roused himself from his deep reverie, and felt for the string connected with the bell-pull, which it was the butler's duty invariably to attach to the arm of his master's chair previous to his last exit from the dining-room; for, as Mr Witherington very truly observed, it was very uncomfortable to be obliged to get up and ring the bell: indeed, more than once Mr Witherington had calculated the advantages and disadvantages of having a daughter about eight years old who could ring bells, air the newspapers, and cut the leaves of a new novel.  When, however, he called to mind that she could not always remain at that precise age, he decided that the balance of comfort was against it.  Mr Witherington, having pulled the bell again, fell into a brown study.  Mr Jonathan, the butler, made his appearance; but observing that his master was occupied, he immediately stopped at the door, erect, motionless, and with a face as melancholy as if he was performing mute at the porch of some departed peer of the realm; for it is an understood thing, that the greater the rank of the defunct the longer must be the face, and, of course, the better must be the pay.  Now, as Mr Witherington is still in profound thought, and Mr Jonathan will stand as long as a hackney-coach horse, we will just leave them as they are, while we introduce the brief history of the latter to our readers.  Jonathan Trapp has served as foot_boy_, which term, we believe, is derived from those who are in that humble capacity receiving a _quantum suff._ of the application of the feet of those above them to increase the energy of their service; then as foot_man_; which implies that they have been promoted to the more agreeable right of administering instead of receiving the above dishonourable applications; and lastly, for promotion could go no higher in the family, he had been raised to the dignity of butler in the service of Mr Witherington senior.  Jonathan then fell in love, for butlers are guilty of indiscretions as well as their masters: neither he nor his fair flame, who was a lady's maid in another family, notwithstanding that they had witnessed the consequences of this error in others, would take warning; they gave warning, and they married.  Like most butlers and ladies' maids who pair off, they set up a public-house; and it is but justice to the lady's maid to say, that she would have preferred an eating-house, but was overruled by Jonathan, who argued, that although people would drink when they were not dry, they never would eat unless they were hungry.  Now, although there was truth in the observation, this is certain, that business did not prosper: it has been surmised that Jonathan's tall, lank, lean figure injured his custom, as people are but too much inclined to judge of the goodness of the ale by the rubicund face and rotundity of the landlord; and therefore inferred that there could be no good beer where mine host was the picture of famine.  There certainly is much in appearances in this world; and it appears that, in consequence of Jonathan's cadaverous appearance, he very soon appeared in the _Gazette_; but what ruined Jonathan in one profession procured him immediate employment in another.  An appraiser, upholsterer, and undertaker, who was called in to value the fixtures, fixed his eye upon Jonathan, and knowing the value of his peculiarly lugubrious appearance, and having a half-brother of equal height, offered him immediate employment as a mute.  Jonathan soon forgot to mourn his own loss of a few hundreds in his new occupation of mourning the loss of thousands; and his erect, stiff, statue-like carriage, and long melancholy face, as he stood at the portals of those who had entered the portals of the next world, were but too often a sarcasm upon the grief of the inheritors. Even grief is worth nothing in this trafficking world unless it be paid for.  Jonathan buried many, and at last buried his wife.  So far all was well; but at last he buried his master, the undertaker, which was not quite so desirable.  Although Jonathan wept not, yet did he express mute sorrow as he marshalled him to his long home, and drank to his memory in a pot of porter as he returned from the funeral, perched, with many others, like carrion crows on the top of the hearse.  And now Jonathan was thrown out of employment from a reason which most people would have thought the highest recommendation.  Every undertaker refused to take him, because they could not match him.  In this unfortunate dilemma, Jonathan thought of Mr Witherington junior; he had served and he had buried Mr Witherington his father, and Lady Mary his mother; he felt that he had strong claims for such variety of services, and he applied to the bachelor.  Fortunately for Jonathan, Mr Witherington's butler-incumbent was just about to commit the same folly as Jonathan had done before, and Jonathan was again installed, resolving in his own mind to lead his former life, and have nothing more to do with ladies' maids.  But from habit Jonathan still carried himself as a mute on all ordinary occasions--never indulging in an approximation to mirth, except when he perceived that his master was in high spirits, and then rather from a sense of duty than from any real hilarity of heart.  Jonathan was no mean scholar for his station in life, and during his service with the undertaker, he had acquired the English of all the Latin mottoes which are placed upon the hatchments; and these mottoes, when he considered them as apt, he was very apt to quote.  We left Jonathan standing at the door; he had closed it, and the handle still remained in his hand.  ""Jonathan,"" said Mr Witherington, after a long pause--""I wish to look at the last letter from New York, you will find it on my dressing-table.""  Jonathan quitted the room without reply, and made his reappearance with the letter.  ""It is a long time that I have been expecting this vessel, Jonathan,"" observed Mr Witherington, unfolding the letter.  ""Yes, sir, a long while; _tempus fugit_,"" replied the butler in a low tone, half shutting his eyes.  ""I hope to God no accident has happened,"" continued Mr Witherington: ""my poor little cousin and her twins e'en now that I speak, they may be all at the bottom of the sea.""  ""Yes, sir,"" replied the butler; ""the sea defrauds many an honest undertaker of his profits.""  ""By the blood of the Witheringtons!  I may be left without an heir, and shall be obliged to marry, which would be very uncomfortable.""  ""Very little comfort,"" echoed Jonathan--""my wife is dead.  In caelo quies.""  ""Well, we must hope for the best; but this suspense is anything but comfortable,"" observed Mr Witherington, after looking over the contents of the letter for at least the twentieth time.  ""That will do, Jonathan; I'll ring for coffee presently;"" and Mr Witherington was again alone and with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling.  A cousin of Mr Witherington, and a very great favourite (for Mr Witherington, having a large fortune, and not having anything to do with business, was courted by his relations), had, to a certain degree, committed herself; that is to say, that, notwithstanding the injunctions of her parents, she had fallen in love with a young lieutenant in a marching regiment, whose pedigree was but respectable, and whose fortune was anything but respectable, consisting merely of a subaltern's pay. Poor men, unfortunately, always make love better than those who are rich, because, having less to care about, and not being puffed up with their own consequence, they are not so selfish and think much more of the lady than of themselves.  Young ladies, also, who fall in love, never consider whether there is sufficient ""to make the pot boil""-- probably because young ladies in love lose their appetites, and, not feeling inclined to eat at that time, they imagine that love will always supply the want of food.  Now, we will appeal to the married ladies whether we are not right in asserting that, although the collation spread for them and their friends on the day of the marriage is looked upon with almost loathing, they do not find their appetites return with interest soon afterwards.  This was precisely the case with Cecilia, or rather, Cecilia Templemore, for she had changed her name the day before. It was also the case with her husband, who always had a good appetite, even during his days of courtship; and the consequence was, that the messman's account, for they lived in barracks, was, in a few weeks, rather alarming.  Cecilia applied to her family, who very kindly sent her word that she might starve; but, the advice neither suiting her nor her husband, she then wrote to her cousin Antony, who sent her word that he would be most happy to receive them at his table, and that they should take up their abode in Finsbury Square.  This was exactly what they wished; but still there was a certain difficulty; Lieutenant Templemore's regiment was quartered in a town in Yorkshire, which was some trifling distance from Finsbury Square; and to be at Mr Witherington's dinner-table at six p.m., with the necessity of appearing at parade every morning at nine a.m., was a dilemma not to be got out of.  Several letters were interchanged upon this knotty subject: and at last it was agreed that Mr Templemore should sell out, and come up to Mr Witherington with his pretty wife: he did so, and found that it was much more comfortable to turn out at nine o'clock in the morning to a good breakfast than to a martial parade.  But Mr Templemore had an honest pride and independence of character which would not permit him to eat the bread of idleness, and after a sojourn of two months in most comfortable quarters, without a messman's bill, he frankly stated his feelings to Mr Witherington, and requested his assistance to procure for himself an honourable livelihood.  Mr Witherington, who had become attached to them both, would have remonstrated, observing that Cecilia was his own cousin, and that he was a confirmed bachelor; but, in this instance, Mr Templemore was firm, and Mr Witherington very unwillingly consented.  A mercantile house of the highest respectability required a partner who could superintend their consignments to America.  Mr Witherington advanced the sum required; and, in a few weeks, Mr and Mrs Templemore sailed for New York.  Mr Templemore was active and intelligent; their affairs prospered; and, in a few years, they anticipated a return to their native soil with a competence.  But the autumn of the second year after their arrival proved very sickly; the yellow fever raged; and among the thousands who were carried off, Mr Templemore was a victim, about three weeks after his wife had been brought to bed of twins.  Mrs Templemore rose from her couch a widow and the mother of two fine boys.  The loss of Mr Templemore was replaced by the establishment with which he was connected, and Mr Witherington offered to his cousin that asylum which, in her mournful and unexpected bereavement, she so much required.  In three months her affairs were arranged; and with her little boys hanging at the breasts of two negro nurses,--for no others could be procured who would undertake the voyage,--Mrs Templemore, with Coco as male servant, embarked on board of the good ship _Circassian_, A1, bound to Liverpool.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE GALE.  Those who, standing on the pier, had witnessed the proud bearing of the _Circassian_ as she gave her canvas to the winds, little contemplated her fate: still less did those on board; for confidence is the characteristic of seamen, and they have the happy talent of imparting their confidence to whomsoever may be in their company.  We shall pass over the voyage, confining ourselves to a description of the catastrophe.  It was during a gale from the north-west, which had continued for three days, and by which the _Circassian_ had been driven into the Bay of Biscay, that at about twelve o'clock at night, a slight lull was perceptible.  The captain, who had remained on deck, sent down for the chief mate.  ""Oswald,"" said Captain Ingram, ""the gale is breaking, and I think before morning we shall have had the worst of it.  I shall lie down for an hour or two; call me if there be any change.""  Oswald Bareth, a tall, sinewy-built, and handsome specimen of transatlantic growth, examined the whole circumference of the horizon before he replied.  At last his eyes were steadily fixed to leeward: ""I've a notion not, sir,"" said he; ""I see no signs of clearing off to leeward: only a lull for relief, and a fresh hand at the bellows, depend upon it.""  ""We have now had it three days,"" replied Captain Ingram, ""and that's the life of a summer gale.""  ""Yes,"" rejoined the mate; ""but always provided that it don't blow back again.  I don't like the look of it, sir; and have it back we shall, as sure as there's snakes in Virginny.""  ""Well, so be if so be,"" was the safe reply of the captain.  ""You must keep a sharp look out, Bareth, and don't leave the deck to call me; send a hand down.""  The captain descended to his cabin.  Oswald looked at the compass in the binnacle--spoke a few words to the man at the helm--gave one or two terrible kicks in the ribs to some of the men who were caulking--sounded the pump-well--put a fresh quid of tobacco into his cheek, and then proceeded to examine the heavens above.  A cloud, much darker and more descending than the others, which obscured the firmament, spread over the zenith, and based itself upon the horizon to leeward.  Oswald's eye had been fixed upon it but a few seconds, when he beheld a small lambent gleam of lightning pierce through the most opaque part; then another, and more vivid.  Of a sudden the wind lulled, and the _Circassian_ righted from her careen.  Again the wind howled, and again the vessel was pressed down to her bearings by its force: again another flash of lightning, which was followed by a distant peal of thunder.  ""Had the worst of it, did you say, captain?  I've a notion that the worst is yet to come,"" muttered Oswald, still watching the heavens.  ""How does she carry her helm, Matthew?"" inquired Oswald, walking aft.  ""Spoke a-weather.""  ""I'll have the trysail off her, at any rate,"" continued the mate.  ""Aft, there my lads! and lower down the trysail.  Keep the sheet fast till it's down, or the flogging will frighten the lady-passenger out of her wits.  Well, if ever I own a craft, I'll have no women on board. Dollars shan't tempt me.""  The lightning now played in rapid forks; and the loud thunder, which instantaneously followed each flash, proved its near approach.  A deluge of slanting rain descended--the wind lulled--roared again--then lulled-- shifted a point or two, and the drenched and heavy sails flapped.  ""Up with the helm, Mat!"" cried Oswald, as a near flash of lightning for a moment blinded, and the accompanying peal of thunder deafened, those on deck.  Again the wind blew strong--it ceased, and it was a dead calm. The sails hung down from the yards, and the rain descended in perpendicular torrents, while the ship rocked to and fro in the trough of the sea, and the darkness became suddenly intense.  ""Down there, one of you! and call the captain,"" said Oswald.  ""By the Lord! we shall have it.  Main braces there, men, and square the yards. Be smart!  That topsail should have been in,"" muttered the mate; ""but I'm not captain.  Square away the yards, my lads!"" continued he; ""quick, quick!--there's no child's play here!""  Owing to the difficulty of finding and passing the ropes to each other, from the intensity of the darkness, and the deluge of rain which blinded them, the men were not able to execute the order of the mate so soon as it was necessary; and before they could accomplish their task, or Captain Ingram could gain the deck, the wind suddenly burst upon the devoted vessel from the quarter directly opposite to that from which the gale had blown, taking her all a-back, and throwing her on her beam-ends.  The man at the helm was hurled over the wheel; while the rest, who were with Oswald at the main-bits, with the coils of ropes, and every other article on deck not secured, were rolled into the scuppers, struggling to extricate themselves from the mass of confusion and the water in which they floundered.  The sudden revulsion awoke all the men below, who imagined that the ship was foundering; and, from the only hatchway not secured, they poured up in their shirts with their other garments in their hands, to put them on--if fate permitted.  Oswald Bareth was the first who clambered up from to leeward.  He gained the helm, which he put hard up.  Captain Ingram and some of the seamen also gained the helm.  It is the rendezvous of all good seamen in emergencies of this description: but the howling of the gale--the blinding of the rain and salt spray--the seas checked in their running by the shift of wind, and breaking over the ship in vast masses of water--the tremendous peals of thunder--and the intense darkness which accompanied these horrors, added to the inclined position of the vessel, which obliged them to climb from one part of the deck to another, for some time checked all profitable communication.  Their only friend, in this conflict of the elements, was the lightning (unhappy, indeed, the situation in which lightning can be welcomed as a friend); but its vivid and forked flames, darting down upon every quarter of the horizon, enabled them to perceive their situation; and, awful as it was, when momentarily presented to their sight, it was not so awful as darkness and uncertainty.  To those who have been accustomed to the difficulties and dangers of a sea-faring life, there are no lines which speak more forcibly to the imagination, or prove the beauty and power of the Greek poet, than those in the noble prayer of Ajax:    ""Lord of earth and air,   O king!  O father! hear my humble prayer.   Dispel this cloud, that light of heaven restore;   Give me to see--and Ajax asks no more,   If Greece must perish--we Thy will obey;   But _let us perish in the face of day_!""  Oswald gave the helm to two of the seamen, and with his knife cut adrift the axes, which were lashed round the mizen-mast in painted canvas covers.  One he retained for himself,--the others he put into the hands of the boatswain and the second mate.  To speak so as to be heard was almost impossible, from the tremendous roaring of the wind; but the lamp still burned in the binnacle, and by its feeble light Captain Ingram could distinguish the signs made by the mate, and could give his consent.  It was necessary that the ship should be put before the wind; and the helm had no power over her.  In a short time the lanyards of the mizen rigging were severed, and the mizen-mast went over the side, almost unperceived by the crew on the other parts of the deck, or even those near, had it not been from blows received by those who were too close to it, from the falling of the topsail-sheets and the rigging about the mast.  Oswald, with his companions, regained the binnacle, and for a little while watched the compass.  The ship did not pay off, and appeared to settle down more into the water.  Again Oswald made his signs, and again the captain gave his assent.  Forward sprang the undaunted mate, clinging to the bulwark and belaying-pins, and followed by his hardy companions, until they had all three gained the main channels.  Here, their exposure to the force of the breaking waves, and the stoutness of the ropes yielding but slowly to the blows of the axes, which were used almost under water, rendered the service one of extreme difficulty and danger.  The boatswain was washed over the bulwark and dashed to leeward, where the lee-rigging only saved him from a watery grave. Unsubdued, he again climbed up to windward, rejoined and assisted his companions.  The last blow was given by Oswald--the lanyards flew through the dead-eyes--and the tall mast disappeared in the foaming seas.  Oswald and his companions hastened from their dangerous position, and rejoined the captain, who, with many of the crew, still remained near the wheel.  The ship now slowly paid off and righted.  In a few minutes she was flying before the gale, rolling heavily, and occasionally striking upon the wrecks of the masts, which she towed with her by the lee-rigging.  Although the wind blew with as much violence as before, still it was not with the same noise, now that the ship was before the wind with her after-masts gone.  The next service was to clear the ship of the wrecks of the masts; but, although all now assisted, but little could be effected until the day had dawned, and even then it was a service of danger, as the ship rolled gunwale under.  Those who performed the duty were slung in ropes, that they might not be washed away; and hardly was it completed, when a heavy roll, assisted by a jerking heave from a sea which struck her on the chess-tree, sent the foremast over the starboard cathead.  Thus was the _Circassian_ dismasted in the gale.    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE LEAK.  The wreck of the foremast was cleared from the ship; the gale continued, but the sun shone brightly and warmly.  The _Circassian_ was again brought to the wind.  All danger was now considered to be over, and the seamen joked and laughed as they were busied in preparing jury-masts to enable them to reach their destined port.  ""I wouldn't have cared so much about this spree,"" said the boatswain, ""if it warn't for the mainmast; it was such a beauty.  There's not another stick to be found equal to it in the whole length of the Mississippi.""  ""Bah! man,"" replied Oswald; ""there's as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it, and as good sticks growing as ever were felled; but I guess we'll pay pretty dear for our spars when we get to Liverpool,--but that concerns the owners.""  The wind, which, at the time of its sudden change to the southward and eastward, had blown with the force of a hurricane, now settled into a regular strong gale, such as sailors are prepared to meet and laugh at. The sky was also bright and clear, and they had not the danger of a lee shore.  It was a delightful change after a night of darkness, danger, and confusion and the men worked that they might get sufficient sail on the ship to steady her, and enable them to shape a course.  ""I suppose now that we have the trysail on her forward, the captain will be for running for it,"" observed one who was busy turning in a dead-eye.  ""Yes,"" replied the boatswain; ""and with this wind on our quarter we shan't want much sail, I've a notion.""  ""Well, then, one advantage in losing your mast--you haven't much trouble about the rigging.""  ""Trouble enough, though, Bill, when we get in,"" replied another, gruffly; ""new lower rigging to parcel and sarve, and every block to turn in afresh.""  ""Never mind, longer in port--I'll get spliced.""  ""Why, how often do you mean to get spliced, Bill?  You've a wife in every State, to my sartin knowledge.""  ""I ain't got one at Liverpool, Jack.""  ""Well, you may take one there, Bill; for you've been sweet upon that nigger girl for these last three weeks.""  ""Any port in a storm, but she won't do for harbour duty.  But the fact is, you're all wrong there, Jack, its the babbies I likes--I likes to see them both together, hanging at the niggers' breasts, I always think of two spider-monkeys nursing two kittens.""  ""I knows the women, but I never knows the children.  It's just six of one and half-a-dozen of the other; ain't it, Bill?""  ""Yes; like two bright bullets out of the same mould.  I say, Bill, did any of your wives ever have twins?""  ""No; nor I don't intend, until the owners give us double pay.""  ""By-the-bye,"" interrupted Oswald, who had been standing under the weather bulk-head, listening to the conversation, and watching the work in progress, ""we may just as well see if she has made any water with all this straining and buffeting.  By the Lord I never thought of that. Carpenter, lay down your adze and sound the well.""  The carpenter, who, notwithstanding the uneasiness of the dismasted vessel, was performing his important share of the work, immediately complied with the order.  He drew up the rope-yarn, to which an iron rule had been suspended, and lowered down into the pump-well, and perceived that the water was dripping from it.  Imagining that it must have been wet from the quantity of water shipped over all, the carpenter disengaged the rope-yarn from the rule, drew another from the junk lying on the deck, which the seamen were working up, and then carefully proceeded to plumb the well.  He hauled it up, and, looking at it for some moments aghast, exclaimed, ""_Seven feet_ of water in the hold, by God.""  If the crew of the _Circassian_, the whole of which were on deck, had been struck with an electric shock, the sudden change of their countenances could not have been greater than was produced by this appalling intelligence.  Heap upon sailors every disaster, every danger which can be accumulated from the waves, the wind, the elements, or the enemy, and they will bear up against them with a courage amounting to heroism.  All that they demand is, that the one plank ""between them and death"" is sound, and they will trust to their own energies, and will be confident in their own skill: but _spring a leak_ and they are half paralysed; and if it gain upon them they are subdued; for when they find that their exertions are futile, they are little better than children.  Oswald sprang to the pumps when he heard the carpenter's report.  ""Try again, Abel--it cannot be: cut away that line; hand us here a dry rope-yarn.""  Once more the well was sounded by Oswald, and the result was the same. ""We must rig the pumps, my lads,"" said the mate, endeavouring to conceal his own fears; ""half this water must have found its way in when she was on her beam-ends.""  This idea, so judiciously thrown out, was caught at by the seamen, who hastened to obey the order, while Oswald went down to acquaint the captain, who, worn out with watching and fatigue, had, now that danger was considered to be over, thrown himself into his cot to obtain a few hours' repose.  ""Do you think, Bareth, that we have sprung a leak?"" said the captain, earnestly, ""She never could have taken in that quantity of water.""  ""Never, sir,"" replied the mate; ""but she has been so strained, that she may have opened her top-sides.  I trust it is no worse.""  ""What is your opinion, then?""  ""I am afraid that the wrecks of the masts have injured her: you may recollect how often we struck against them before we could clear ourselves of them; once, particularly, the mainmast appeared to be right under her bottom, I recollect, and she struck very heavy on it.""  ""Well, it is God's will: let us get on deck as fast as we can.""  When they arrived on deck, the carpenter walked up to the captain, and quietly said to him, ""_Seven feet three, sir_.""  The pumps were then in full action; the men had divided, by the direction of the boatswain, and, stripped naked to the waist, relieved each other every two minutes. For half an hour they laboured incessantly.  This was the half-hour of suspense: the great point to be ascertained was, whether she leaked through the top-sides, and had taken in the water during the second gale; if so, there was every hope of keeping it under.  Captain Ingram and the mate remained in silence near the capstan, the former with his watch in his hand, during the time that the sailors exerted themselves to the utmost.  It was ten minutes past seven when the half hour had expired; the well was sounded and the line carefully measured--_Seven feet six inches_!  So that the water had gained upon them, notwithstanding that they had plied the pumps to the utmost of their strength.  A mute look of despair was exchanged among the crew, but it was followed up by curses and execrations.  Captain Ingram remained silent, with his lips compressed.  ""It's all over with us!"" exclaimed one of the men.  ""Not yet, my lads; we have one more chance,"" said Oswald.  ""I've a notion that the ship's sides have been opened by the infernal straining of last night, and that she is now taking it in at the top-sides generally: if so, we have only to put her before the wind again, and have another good spell at the pumps.  When no longer strained, as she is now with her broadside to the sea, she will close all up again.""  ""I shouldn't wonder if Mr Bareth is not right,"" replied the carpenter; ""however, that's my notion, too.""  ""And mine,"" added Captain Ingram.  ""Come, my men! never say die while there's a shot in the locker.  Let's try her again.""  And, to encourage the men, Captain Ingram threw off his coat and assisted at the first spell, while Oswald went to the helm and put the ship before the wind.  As the _Circassian_ rolled before the gale, the lazy manner in which she righted proved how much water there was in the hold.  The seamen exerted themselves for a whole hour without intermission, and the well was again sounded--_eight feet_!  The men did not assert that they would pump no longer; but they too plainly showed their intentions by each resuming in silence his shirt and jacket, which had been taken off at the commencement of his exertions.  ""What's to be done, Oswald?"" said Captain Ingram, as they walked aft. ""You see the men will pump no longer: nor, indeed, would it be of any use.  We are doomed.""  ""The _Circassian_ is, sir, I am afraid,"" replied the mate: ""pumping is of no avail; they could not keep her afloat till day-break.  We must therefore, trust to our boats, which I believe to be all sound, and quit her before night.""  ""Crowded boats in such a sea as this!"" replied Captain Ingram, shaking his head mournfully.  ""Are bad enough, I grant; but better than the sea itself.  All we can do now is to try and keep the men sober, and if we can do so it will be better than to fatigue them uselessly; they'll want all their strength before they put foot again upon dry land--if ever they are so fortunate. Shall I speak to them?""  ""Do, Oswald,"" replied the captain; ""for myself I care little, God knows; but my wife--my children!""  ""My lads,"" said Oswald, going forward to the men, who had waited in moody silence the result of the conference--""as for pumping any longer it would be only wearing out your strength for no good.  We must now look to our boats; and a good boat is better than a bad ship.  Still this gale and cross-running sea are rather too much for boats at present; we had therefore better stick to the ship as long as we can. Let us set to with a will and get the boats ready, with provisions, water, and what may be needful, and then we must trust to God's mercy and our own endeavours.""  ""No boat can stand this sea,"" observed one of the men.  ""I'm of opinion, as it's to be a short life, it may as well be a merry one.  What d'ye say, my lads?"" continued he, appealing to the men.  Several of the crew were of the same opinion: but Oswald, stepping forward, seized one of the axes which lay at the main-bits, and going up to the seaman who had spoken, looked him steadfastly in the face:--  ""Williams,"" said the mate, ""a short life it may be to all of us, but not a merry one; the meaning of which I understand very well.  Sorry I shall be to have your blood, or that of others, on my hands; but as sure as there's a heaven, I'll cleave to the shoulder the first man who attempts to break into the spirit-room.  You know I never joke.  Shame upon you! Do you call yourselves men, when, for the sake of a little liquor now, you would lose your only chance of getting drunk every day as soon as we get on shore again?  There's a time for all things; and I've a notion this is a time to be sober.""  As most of the crew sided with Oswald, the weaker party were obliged to submit, and the preparations were commenced.  The two boats on the booms were found to be in good condition.  One party was employed cutting away the bulwarks, that the boats might be launched over the side, as there were no means of hoisting them out.  The well was again sounded.  Nine feet of water in the hold, and the ship evidently settling fast.  Two hours had now passed, and the gale was not so violent; the sea, also, which at the change of wind had been cross, appeared to have recovered its regular run.  All was ready; the sailors, once at work again, had, in some measure, recovered their spirits, and were buoyed up with fresh hopes at the slight change in their favour from the decrease of the wind.  The two boats were quite large enough to contain the whole of the crew and passengers; but, as the sailors said among themselves (proving the kindness of their hearts), ""What was to become of those two poor babbies, in an open boat for days and nights, perhaps?""  Captain Ingram had gone down to Mrs Templemore, to impart to her their melancholy prospects; and the mother's heart, as well as the mother's voice, echoed the words of the seamen, ""What will become of my poor babes?""  It was not till nearly six o'clock in the evening that all was ready: the ship was slowly brought to the wind again, and the boats launched over the side.  By this time the gale was much abated; but the vessel was full of water, and was expected soon to go down.  There is no time in which coolness and determination are more required than in a situation like the one which we have attempted to describe. It is impossible to know the precise moment at which a water-logged vessel, in a heavy sea, may go down: and its occupants are in a state of mental fever, with the idea of their remaining in her so late that she will suddenly submerge, and leave them to struggle in the waves.  This feeling actuated many of the crew of the _Circassian_, and they had already retreated to the boats.  All was arranged; Oswald had charge of one boat, and it was agreed that the larger should receive Mrs Templemore and her children, under the protection of Captain Ingram. The number appointed to Oswald's boat being completed, he shoved off, to make room for the other, and laid-to to leeward, waiting to keep company.  Mrs Templemore came up with Captain Ingram, and was assisted by him into the boat.  The nurse, with one child, was at last placed by her side; Coco was leading Judy, the other nurse, with the remaining infant in her arms, and Captain Ingram, who had been obliged to go into the boat with the first child, was about to return to assist Judy with the other, when the ship gave a heavy pitch, and her forecastle was buried in the wave: at the same time the gunwale of the boat was stove by coming in contact with the side of the vessel.  ""She's down, by God!"" exclaimed the alarmed seamen in the boat; shoving off to escape from the vortex.  Captain Ingram, who was standing on the boat's thwarts to assist Judy, was thrown back into the bottom of the boat; and, before he could extricate himself, the boat was separated from the ship, and had drifted to leeward.  ""My child!"" screamed the mother: ""my child!""  ""Pull to again, my lads!"" cried Captain Ingram, seizing the tiller.  The men, who had been alarmed at the idea that the ship was going down, now that they saw that she was still afloat, got out the oars and attempted to regain her, but in vain--they could not make head against the sea and wind.  Further and further did they drift to leeward, notwithstanding their exertions; while the frantic mother extended her arms, imploring and entreating.  Captain Ingram, who had stimulated the sailors to the utmost, perceived that further attempts were useless.  ""My child! my child!"" screamed Mrs Templemore, standing up, and holding out her arms towards the vessel.  At a sign from the captain, the head of the boat was veered round.  The bereaved mother knew that all hope was gone, and she fell down in a state of insensibility.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE OLD MAID.  One morning, shortly after the disasters which we have described, Mr Witherington descended to his breakfast-room somewhat earlier than usual, and found his green morocco easy-chair already tenanted by no less a personage than William the footman, who, with his feet on the fender, was so attentively reading the newspaper that he did not hear his master's entrance.  ""By my ancestor, who fought on his stumps! but I hope you are quite comfortable, Mr William; nay, I beg I may not disturb you, sir.""  William, although as impudent as most of his fraternity, was a little taken aback.  ""I beg your pardon, sir, but Mr Jonathan had not time to look over the paper.""  ""Nor is it required that he should, that I know of, sir.""  ""Mr Jonathan says, sir, that it is always right to look over the _deaths_, that news of that kind may not shock you.""  ""Very considerate, indeed.""  ""And there is a story there, sir, about a shipwreck.""  ""A shipwreck! where, William?  God bless me! where is it?""  ""I am afraid it is the same ship you are so anxious about, sir,--the--I forget the name, sir.""  Mr Witherington took the newspaper, and his eye soon caught the paragraph in which the rescue of the two negroes and child from the wreck of the _Circassian_ was fully detailed.  ""It is indeed!"" exclaimed Mr Witherington.  ""My poor Cecilia in an open boat! one of the boats was seen to go down,--perhaps she's dead-- merciful God! one boy saved.  Mercy on me! where's Jonathan?""  ""Here, sir,"" replied Jonathan, very solemnly, who had just brought in the eggs, and now stood erect as a mute behind his master's chair, for it was a case of danger, if not of death.  ""I must go to Portsmouth immediately after breakfast--shan't eat though--appetite all gone.""  ""People seldom do, sir, on these melancholy occasions,"" replied Jonathan.  ""Will you take your own carriage, sir, or a mourning coach?""  ""A mourning coach at fourteen miles an hour, with two pair of horses! Jonathan, you're crazy.""  ""Will you please to have black silk hatbands and gloves for the coachman and servants who attend you, sir?""  ""Confound your shop! no; this is a resurrection, not a death; it appears that the negro thinks only one of the boats went down.""  ""_Mors omnia vincit_,"" quoth Jonathan, casting up his eyes.  ""Never you mind that; mind your own business.  That's the postman's knock--see if there are any letters.""  There were several; and amongst the others there was one from Captain Maxwell, of the _Eurydice_, detailing the circumstances already known, and informing Mr Witherington that he had despatched the two negroes and the child to his address by that day's coach, and that one of the officers, who was going to town by the same conveyance, would see them safe to his house.  Captain Maxwell was an old acquaintance of Mr Witherington--had dined at his house in company with the Templemores, and therefore had extracted quite enough information from the negroes to know where to direct them.  ""By the blood of my ancestors! they'll be here to night,"" cried Mr Witherington; ""and I have saved my journey.  What is to be done? better tell Mary to get rooms ready: d'ye hear, William? beds for one little boy and two niggers.""  ""Yes, sir,"" replied William; ""but where are the black people to be put?""  ""Put!  I don't care; one may sleep with cook, the other with Mary.""  ""Very well, sir, I'll tell them,"" replied William, hastening away, delighted at the row which he anticipated in the kitchen.  ""If you please, sir,"" observed Jonathan, ""one of the negroes is, I believe, a man.""  ""Well, what then?""  ""Only, sir, the maids may object to sleep with him.""  ""By all the plagues of the Witheringtons! this is true; well, you may take him, Jonathan--you like that colour.""  ""Not in the dark, sir,"" replied Jonathan with a bow.  ""Well, then, let them sleep together: so that affair is settled.""  ""Are they man and wife, sir?"" said the butler.  ""The devil take them both! how should I know?  Let me have my breakfast, and we'll talk over the matter by-and-by.""  Mr Witherington applied to his eggs, and muffin, eating his breakfast as fast as he could, without knowing why; but the reason was that he was puzzled and perplexed with the anticipated arrival, and longed to think quietly over the dilemma, for it was a dilemma to an old bachelor.  As soon as he had swallowed his second cup of tea he put himself into his easy-chair, in an easy attitude, and was very soon soliloquising as follows:--  ""By the blood of the Witheringtons! what am I, an old bachelor, to do with a baby, and a wet-nurse as black as the ace of spades, and another black fellow in the bargain.  Send him back again? yes, that's best: but the child--woke every morning at five o'clock with its squalling-- obliged to kiss it three times a-day--pleasant!--and then that nigger of a nurse--thick lips--kissing child all day, and then holding it out to me--ignorant as a cow--if child has the stomach-ache she'll cram a pepper-pod down its throat--West India fashion--children never without the stomach-ache!--my poor, poor cousin!--what has become of her and the other child, too?--wish they may pick her up, poor dear! and then she will come and take care of her own children--don't know what to do-- great mind to send for sister Moggy--but she's so fussy--won't be in a hurry.  Think again.""  Here Mr Witherington was interrupted by two taps at the door.  ""Come in,"" said he; and the cook, with her face as red as if she had been dressing a dinner for eighteen, made her appearance without the usual clean apron.  ""If you please, sir,"" said she, curtseying, ""I will thank you to suit yourself with another cook.""  ""Oh, very well,"" replied Mr Witherington, angry at the interruption.  ""And if you please, sir, I should like to go this very day--indeed, sir, I shall not stay.""  ""Go to the devil! if you please,"" replied Mr Witherington, angrily; ""but first go out and shut the door after you.""  The cook retired, and Mr Witherington was again alone.  ""Confound the old woman--what a huff she is in! won't cook for black people, I suppose--yes, that's it.""  Here Mr Witherington was again interrupted by a second double tap at the door.  ""Oh! thought better of it, I suppose.  Come in.""  It was not the cook, but Mary, the housemaid, that entered.  ""If you please, sir,"" said she, whimpering, ""I should wish to leave my situation.""  ""A conspiracy, by heavens!  Well, you may go.""  ""To-night, sir, if you please,"" answered the woman.  ""This moment, for all I care!"" exclaimed Mr Witherington in his wrath.  The housemaid retired; and Mr Witherington took some time to compose himself.  ""Servants all going to the devil in this country,"" said he at last; ""proud fools--won't clean rooms after black people, I suppose--yes, that's it, confound them all, black and white! here's my whole establishment upset by the arrival of a baby.  Well, it is very uncomfortable--what shall I do?--send for sister Moggy?--no, I'll send for Jonathan.""  Mr Witherington rang the bell, and Jonathan made his appearance.  ""What is all this, Jonathan?"" said he; ""cook angry--Mary crying--both going away--what's it all about?""  ""Why, sir, they were told by William that it was your positive order that the two black people were to sleep with them; and I believe he told Mary that the man was to sleep with her.""  ""Confound that fellow! he's always at mischief; you know, Jonathan, I never meant that.""  ""I thought not, sir, as it is quite contrary to custom,"" replied Jonathan.  ""Well, then, tell them so, and let's hear no more about it.""  Mr Witherington then entered into a consultation with his butler, and acceded to the arrangements proposed by him.  The parties arrived in due time, and were properly accommodated.  Master Edward was not troubled with the stomach-ache, neither did he wake Mr Witherington at five o'clock in the morning; and, after all, it was not very uncomfortable. But, although things were not quite so uncomfortable as Mr Witherington had anticipated, still they were not comfortable; and Mr Witherington was so annoyed by continual skirmishes with his servants, complaints from Judy, in bad English, of the cook, who, it must be owned, had taken a prejudice against her and Coco, occasional illness of the child, et cetera, that he found his house no longer quiet and peaceable.  Three months had now nearly passed, and no tidings of the boats had been received; and Captain Maxwell, who came up to see Mr Witherington, gave it as his decided opinion that they must have foundered in the gale. As, therefore, there appeared to be no chance of Mrs Templemore coming to take care of her child, Mr Witherington at last resolved to write to Bath, where his sister resided, and acquaint her with the whole story, requesting her to come and superintend his domestic concerns.  A few days afterwards he received the following reply:--    ""_Bath, August_.    ""My dear Brother Antony,    ""Your letter arrived safe to hand on Wednesday last, and I must say   that I was not a little surprised at its contents; indeed, I thought   so much about it that I revoked at Lady Betty Blabkin's whist-party,   and lost four shillings and sixpence.  You say that you have a child   at your house belonging to your cousin, who married in so indecorous a   manner.  I hope what you say is true; but, at the same time, I know   what bachelors are guilty of; although, as Lady Betty says, it is   better never to talk or even to hint about these improper things.  I   cannot imagine why men should consider themselves, in an unmarried   state, as absolved from that purity which maidens are so careful to   preserve; and so says Lady Betty, with whom I had a little   conversation on the subject.  As, however, the thing is done, she   agrees with me that it is better to hush it up as well as we can.    ""I presume that you do not intend to make the child your heir, which I   should consider as highly improper; and, indeed, Lady Betty tells me   that the legacy-duty is ten per cent, and that it cannot be avoided.   However, I make it a rule never to talk about these sort of things.   As for your request that I will come up and superintend your   establishment, I have advised with Lady Betty on the subject, and she   agrees with me that, for the honour of the family, it is better that I   should come, as it will save appearances.  You are in a peck of   troubles, as most men are who are free-livers and are led astray by   artful and alluring females.  However, as Lady Betty says, `the least   said, the soonest mended.'    ""I will, therefore, make the necessary arrangements for letting my   house, and hope to join you in about ten days; sooner, I cannot, as I   find that my engagements extend to that period.  Many questions have   already been put to me on this unpleasant subject; but I always give   but one answer, which is, that bachelors will be bachelors; and that,   at all events, it is not so bad as if you were a married man: for I   make it a rule never to talk about, or even to hint about, these sort   of things, for, as Lady Betty says, `Men will get into scrapes, and   the sooner things are hushed up the better.'  So no more at present   from your affectionate sister,    ""Margaret Witherington.    ""PS.  Lady Betty and I both agree that you are very right in hiring   two black people to bring the child into your house, as it makes the   thing look _foreign_ to the neighbours, and we can keep our own   secrets.    ""M.W.""  ""Now, by all the sins of the Witheringtons, if this is not enough to drive a man out of his senses!--Confound the suspicious old maid!  I'll not let her come into this house.  Confound Lady Betty, and all scandal-loving old tabbies like her!  Bless me!"" continued Mr Witherington, throwing the letter on the table with a deep sigh, ""this is anything but comfortable.""  But if Mr Witherington found it anything but comfortable at the commencement, he found it unbearable in the sequel.  His sister Moggy arrived, and installed herself in the house with all the pomp and protecting air of one who was the saviour of her brother's reputation and character.  When the child was first brought down to her, instead of perceiving at once its likeness to Mr Templemore, which was very strong, she looked at it and at her brother's face with her only eye, and shaking her finger, exclaimed--  ""Oh, Antony!  Antony! and did you expect to deceive me?--the nose--the mouth exact--Antony, for shame! fie, for shame!""  But we must hurry over the misery that Mr Witherington's kindness and benevolence brought upon him.  Not a day passed--scarcely an hour, without his ears being galled with his sister's insinuations.  Judy and Coco were sent back to America; the servants, who had remained so long in his service, gave warning one by one, and afterwards, were changed as often almost as there was a change in the moon.  She ruled the house and her brother despotically; and all poor Mr Witherington's comfort was gone until the time arrived when Master Edward was to be sent to school. Mr Witherington then plucked up courage, and after a few stormy months drove his sister back to Bath, and once more found himself comfortable.  Edward came home during the holidays, and was a great favourite; but the idea had become current that he was the son of the old gentleman, and the remarks made were so unpleasant and grating to him, that he was not sorry, much as he was attached to the boy, when he declared his intention to choose the profession of a sailor.  Captain Maxwell introduced him into the service; and afterwards, when, in consequence of ill health and exhaustion, he was himself obliged to leave it for a time, he procured for his _protege_ other ships.  We must, therefore, allow some years to pass away, during which time Edward Templemore pursues his career, Mr Witherington grows older and more particular, and his sister Moggy amuses herself with Lady Betty's remarks and her darling game of whist.  During all this period no tidings of the boats, or of Mrs Templemore and her infant, had been heard; it was therefore naturally conjectured that they had all perished, and they were remembered but as things that had been.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE MIDSHIPMAN.  The weather side of the quarter-deck of H.M. frigate _Unicorn_ was occupied by two very great personages: Captain Plumbton, commanding the ship, who was very great in width if not in height, taking much more than his allowance of the deck, if it were not that he was the proprietor thereof, and entitled to the lion's share.  Captain P was not more than four feet ten inches in height; but then he was equal to that in girth: there was quite enough of him, if he had only been _rolled out_.  He walked with his coat flying open, his thumbs stuck into the arm holes of his waistcoat, so as to throw his shoulders back and increase his horizontal dimensions.  He also held his head well aft, which threw his chest and stomach well forward.  He was the prototype of pomposity and good nature, and he strutted like an actor in a procession.  The other personage was the first lieutenant, whom Nature had pleased to fashion in another mould.  He was as tall as the captain was short--as thin as his superior was corpulent.  His long, lanky legs were nearly up to the captain's shoulders; and he bowed down over the head of his superior, as if he were the crane to hoist up, and the captain the bale of goods to be hoisted.  He carried his hands behind his back, with two fingers twisted together; and his chief difficulty appeared to be to reduce his own stride to the parrot march of the captain.  His features were sharp and lean as was his body, and wore every appearance of a cross-grained temper.  He had been making divers complaints of divers persons, and the captain had hitherto appeared imperturbable.  Captain Plumbton was an even-tempered man, who was satisfied with a good dinner.  Lieutenant Markitall was an odd-tempered man, who would quarrel with his bread and butter.  ""Quite impossible, sir,"" continued the first-lieutenant, ""to carry on the duty without support.""  This oracular observation, which, from the relative forms of the two parties, descended as it were from above, was replied to by the captain with a ""Very true.""  ""Then, sir, I presume you will not object to my putting that man in the report for punishment?""  ""I'll think about it, Mr Markitall.""  This, with Captain Plumbton, was as much as to say, No.  ""The young gentlemen, sir, I am sorry to say, are very troublesome.""  ""Boys always are,"" replied the captain.  ""Yes sir: but the duty must be carried on, and I cannot do without them.""  ""Very true--midshipmen are very useful.""  ""But I am sorry to say, sir, that they are not.  Now sir, there's Mr Templemore; I can do nothing with him--he does nothing but laugh.""  ""Laugh!--Mr Markitall, does he laugh at you?""  ""Not exactly, sir; but he laughs at everything.  If I send him to the mast-head, he goes up laughing; if I call him down, he comes down laughing; if I find fault with him, he laughs the next minute: in fact, sir, he does nothing but laugh.  I should particularly wish, sir, that you would speak to him, and see if any interference on your part--""  ""Would make him cry--eh? better to laugh than cry in this world.  Does he never cry, Mr Markitall?""  ""Yes, sir, and very unseasonably.  The other day, you may recollect, when you punished Wilson the marine, whom I appointed to take care of his chest and hammock, he was crying the whole time; almost tantamount-- at least an indirect species of mutiny on his part, as it implied--""  ""That the boy was sorry that his servant was punished; I never flog a man but I'm sorry myself, Mr Markitall.""  ""Well, I do not press the question of his crying--that I might look over; but his laughing, sir, I must beg that you will take notice of that.  Here he is, sir, coming up the hatchway.  Mr Templemore, the captain wishes to speak to you.""  Now the captain did not wish to speak to him, but, forced upon him as it was by the first-lieutenant, he could do no less.  So Mr Templemore touched his hat, and stood before the captain, we regret to say, with such a good-humoured, sly, confiding smirk on his countenance, as at once established the proof of the accusation, and the enormity of the offence.  ""So, sir,"" said Captain Plumbton, stopping in his perambulation, and squaring his shoulders still more, ""I find that you laugh at the first-lieutenant.""  ""I, sir?"" replied the boy, the smirk expanding into a broad grin.  ""Yes; you, sir,"" said the first-lieutenant, now drawing up to his full height; ""why you're laughing now, sir.""  ""I can't help it, sir--it's not my fault; and I'm sure it's not yours, sir,"" added the boy, demurely.  ""Are you aware, Edward--Mr Templemore, I mean--of the impropriety of disrespect to your superior officer?""  ""I never laughed at Mr Markitall but once, sir, that I can recollect, and that was when he tumbled over the messenger.""  ""And why did you laugh at him then, sir?""  ""I always do laugh when any one tumbles down,"" replied the lad; ""I can't help it, sir.""  ""Then, sir, I suppose you would laugh if you saw me rolling in the lee-scuppers?"" said the captain.  ""Oh!"" replied the boy, no longer able to contain himself, ""I'm sure I should burst myself with laughing--I think I see you now, sir.""  ""Do you, indeed!  I'm very glad that you do not; though I'm afraid, young gentleman, you stand convicted by your own confession.""  ""Yes, sir, for laughing, if that is any crime; but it's not in the Articles of War.""  ""No, sir; but disrespect is.  You laugh when you go to the mast-head.""  ""But I obey the order, sir, immediately--Do I not, Mr Markitall?""  ""Yes, sir, you obey the order; but, at the same time, your laughing proves that you do not mind the punishment.""  ""No more I do, sir.  I spend half my time at the mast-head, and I'm used to it now.""  ""But, Mr Templemore, ought you not to feel the disgrace of the punishment?"" inquired the captain, severely.  ""Yes, sir, if I felt I deserved it I should.  I should not laugh, sir, if _you_ sent me to the mast-head,"" replied the boy, assuming a serious countenance.  ""You see, Mr Markitall, that he can be grave,"" observed the captain.  ""I've tried all I can to make him so, sir,"" replied the first-lieutenant; ""but I wish to ask Mr Templemore what he means to imply by saying, `when he deserves it.'  Does he mean to say that I have ever punished him unjustly?""  ""Yes, sir,"" replied the boy, boldly; ""five times out of six, I am mast-headed for nothing--and that's the reason why I do not mind it.""  ""For nothing, sir!  Do you call laughing nothing?""  ""I pay every attention that I can to my duty, sir; I always obey your orders; I try all I can to make you pleased with me--but you are always punishing me.""  ""Yes, sir, for laughing, and, what is worse, making the ship's company laugh.""  ""They `haul and hold' just the same, sir--I think they work all the better for being merry.""  ""And pray, sir, what business have you to think?"" replied the first-lieutenant, now very angry.  ""Captain Plumbton, as this young gentleman thinks proper to interfere with me and the discipline of the ship, I beg you will see what effect your punishing may have upon him.""  ""Mr Templemore,"" said the captain, ""you are, in the first place, too free in your speech, and, in the next place, too fond of laughing. There is, Mr Templemore, a time for all things--a time to be merry, and a time to be serious.  The quarter-deck is not a fit place for mirth.""  ""I'm sure the gangway is not,"" shrewdly interrupted the boy.  ""No--you are right, nor the gangway; but you may laugh on the forecastle, and when below with your messmates.""  ""No, sir, we may not; Mr Markitall always sends out if he hears us laughing.""  ""Because, Mr Templemore, you're always laughing.""  ""I believe I am, sir; and if it's wrong I'm sorry to displease you, but I mean no disrespect.  I laugh in my sleep--I laugh when I awake--I laugh when the sun shines--I always feel so happy; but though you do mast-head me, Mr Markitall, I should not laugh, but be very sorry, if any misfortune happened to you.""  ""I believe you would, boy--I do indeed, Mr Markitall,"" said the captain.  ""Well, sir,"" replied the first-lieutenant, ""as Mr Templemore appears to be aware of his error, I do not wish to press my complaint--I have only to request that he will never laugh again.""  ""You hear, boy, what the first-lieutenant says; it's very reasonable, and I beg I may hear no more complaints.  Mr Markitall, let me know when the foot of that foretopsail will be repaired--I should like to shift it to-night.""  Mr Markitall went down under the half-deck to make the inquiry.  ""And, Edward,"" said Captain Plumbton, as soon as the lieutenant was out of ear-shot, ""I have a good deal more to say to you upon this subject, but I have no time now.  So come and dine with me--at my table, you know, I allow laughing in moderation.""  The boy touched his hat, and with a grateful, happy countenance, walked away.  We have introduced this little scene, that the reader may form some idea of the character of Edward Templemore.  He was indeed the soul of mirth, good-humour, and kindly feelings towards others; he even felt kindly towards the first-lieutenant, who persecuted him for his risible propensities.  We do not say that the boy was right in laughing at all times, or that the first-lieutenant was wrong in attempting to check it. As the captain said, there is a time for all things, and Edward's laugh was not always seasonable; but it was his nature, and he could not help it.  He was joyous as the May morning; and thus he continued for years, laughing at everything--pleased with everybody--almost universally liked--and his bold, free, and happy spirit unchecked by vicissitude or hardship.  He served his time--was nearly turned back when he was passing his examination for laughing, and then went laughing to sea again--was in command of a boat at the cutting-out of a French corvette, and when on board was so much amused by the little French captain skipping about with his rapier, which proved fatal to many, that at last he received a pink from the little gentleman himself, which laid him on deck.  For this affair, and in consideration of his wound, he obtained his promotion to the rank of lieutenant--was appointed to a line-of-battle ship in the West Indies--laughed at the yellow-fever--was appointed to the tender of that ship, a fine schooner, and was sent to cruise for prize-money for the admiral, and promotion for himself, if he could, by any fortunate encounter, be so lucky as to obtain it.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  SLEEPER'S BAY.  On the western coast of Africa, there is a small bay, which has received more than one name from its occasional visitors.  That by which it was designated by the adventurous Portuguese, who first dared to cleave the waves of the Southern Atlantic, has been forgotten with their lost maritime pre-eminence; the name allotted to it by the woolly-headed natives of the coast has never, perhaps, been ascertained; it is, however, marked down in some of the old English charts as Sleeper's Bay.  The mainland which, by its curvature, has formed this little dent on a coast possessing, and certainly at present requiring few harbours, displays, perhaps, the least inviting of all prospects; offering to the view nothing but a shelving beach of dazzling white sand, backed with a few small hummocks beat up by the occasional fury of the Atlantic gales--arid, bare, and without the slightest appearance of vegetable life.  The inland prospect is shrouded over by a dense mirage, through which here and there are to be discovered the stems of a few distant palm-trees, so broken and disjoined by refraction that they present to the imagination anything but the idea of foliage or shade.  The water in the bay is calm and smooth as the polished mirror; not the smallest ripple is to be heard on the beach, to break through the silence of nature; not a breath of air sweeps over its glassy surface, which is heated with the intense rays of a vertical noonday sun, pouring down a withering flood of light and heat: not a sea-bird is to be discovered wheeling on its flight, or balancing on its wings as it pierces the deep with its searching eye, ready to dart upon its prey.  All is silence, solitude, and desolation, save that occasionally may be seen the fin of some huge shark, either sluggishly moving through the heated element, or stationary in the torpor of the mid-day heat.  A site so sterile, so stagnant, so little adapted to human life, cannot well be conceived, unless, by flying to extremes, we were to portray the chilling blast, the transfixing cold, and ""close-ribbed ice,"" at the frozen poles.  At the entrance of this bay, in about three fathoms water, heedless of the spring cable which hung down as a rope which had fallen overboard, there floated, motionless as death, a vessel whose proportions would have challenged the unanimous admiration of those who could appreciate the merits of her build, had she been anchored in the most frequented and busy harbour of the universe.  So beautiful were her lines, that you might almost have imagined her a created being that the ocean had been ordered to receive, as if fashioned by the Divine Architect, to add to the beauty and variety of His works; for, from the huge leviathan to the smallest of the finny tribe--from the towering albatross to the boding petrel of the storm--where could be found, among the winged or finned frequenters of the ocean, a form more appropriate, more fitting, than this specimen of human skill, whose beautiful model and elegant tapering spars were now all that could be discovered to break the meeting lines of the firmament and horizon of the offing.  Alas! she was fashioned, at the will of avarice, for the aid of cruelty and injustice, and now was even more nefariously employed.  She had been a slaver--she was now the far-famed, still more dreaded, pirate-schooner, the _Avenger_.  Not a man-of-war which scoured the deep but had her instructions relative to this vessel, which had been so successful in her career of crime--not a trader in any portion of the navigable globe but whose crew shuddered at the mention of her name, and the remembrance of the atrocities which had been practised by her reckless crew.  She had been everywhere--in the east, the west, the north, and the south, leaving a track behind her of rapine and of murder.  There she lay in motionless beauty; her low sides were painted black, with one small, narrow riband of red--her raking masts were clean scraped--her topmasts, her cross-trees, caps, and even running-blocks, were painted in pure white. Awnings were spread fore and aft to protect the crew from the powerful rays of the sun; her ropes were hauled taut; and in every point she wore the appearance of being under the control of seamanship and strict discipline.  Through the clear smooth water her copper shone brightly; and as you looked over her taffrail down into the calm blue sea, you could plainly discover the sandy bottom beneath her and the anchor which then lay under her counter.  A small boat floated astern, the weight of the rope which attached her appearing, in the perfect calm, to draw her towards the schooner.  We must now go on board, and our first cause of surprise will be the deception relative to the tonnage of the schooner, when viewed from a distance.  Instead of a small vessel of about ninety tons, we discover that she is upwards of two hundred; that her breadth of beam is enormous; and that those spars, which appeared so light and elegant, are of unexpected dimensions.  Her decks are of narrow fir planks, without the least spring or rise; her ropes are of Manilla hemp, neatly secured to copper belaying-pins, and coiled down on the deck, whose whiteness is well contrasted with the bright green paint of her bulwarks; her capstern and binnacles are cased in fluted mahogany, and ornamented with brass; metal stanchions protect the skylights, and the bright muskets are arranged in front of the mainmast, while the boarding-pikes are lashed round the mainboom.  In the centre of the vessel, between the fore and main masts, there is a long brass 32-pounder fixed upon a carriage revolving in a circle, and so arranged that in bad weather it can be lowered down and _housed_; while on each side of her decks are mounted eight brass guns of smaller calibre and of exquisite workmanship.  Her build proves the skill of the architect; her fitting-out, a judgment in which nought has been sacrificed to, although everything has been directed by, taste; and her neatness and arrangement, that, in the person of her commander, to the strictest discipline there is united the practical knowledge of a thorough seaman.  How, indeed, otherwise could she have so long continued her lawless yet successful career?  How could it have been possible to unite a crew of miscreants, who feared not God nor man, most of whom had perpetrated foul murders, or had been guilty of even blacker iniquities?  It was because he who commanded the vessel was so superior as to find in her no rivalry.  Superior in talent, in knowledge of his profession, in courage, and, moreover, in physical strength--which in him was almost Herculean--unfortunately he was also superior to all in villainy, in cruelty, and contempt of all injunctions, moral and Divine.  What had been the early life of this person was but imperfectly known. It was undoubted that he had received an excellent education, and it was said that he was of an ancient border family on the banks of the Tweed: by what chances he had become a pirate--by what errors he had fallen from his station in society, until he became an outcast, had never been revealed; it was only known that he had been some years employed in the slave-trade previous to his seizing this vessel and commencing his reckless career.  The name by which he was known to the crew of the pirate-vessel was ""Cain,"" and well had he chosen this appellation; for, had not his hand for more than three years been against every man's, and every man's hand against his?  In person he was about six feet high, with a breadth of shoulders and of chest denoting the utmost of physical force which, perhaps, has ever been allotted to man.  His features would have been handsome had they not been scarred with wounds; and, strange to say, his eye was mild and of a soft blue.  His mouth was well formed, and his teeth of a pearly white: the hair of his head was crisped and wavy, and his beard, which he wore, as did every person composing the crew of the pirate, covered the lower part of his face in strong, waving, and continued curls.  The proportions of his body were perfect; but from their vastness they became almost terrific.  His costume was elegant, and well adapted to his form: linen trousers, and untanned yellow leather boots, such as are made at the Western Isles; a broad-striped cotton shirt; a red Cashmere shawl round his waist as a sash; a vest embroidered in gold tissue, with a jacket of dark velvet, and pendant gold buttons, hanging over his left shoulder, after the fashion of the Mediterranean seamen; a round Turkish skull-cap, handsomely embroidered; a pair of pistols, and a long knife in his sash, completed his attire.  The crew consisted in all of 165 men, of almost every nation; but it was to be remarked that all those in authority were either Englishmen or from the northern countries; the others were chiefly Spaniards and Maltese.  Still there were Portuguese, Brazilians, negroes, and others, who made up the complement, which at the time we now speak of was increased by twenty-five additional hands.  These were Kroumen, a race of blacks well known at present, who inhabit the coast near Cape Palmas, and are often employed by our men-of-war stationed on the coast to relieve the English seamen from duties which would be too severe to those who were not inured to the climate.  They are powerful, athletic men, good sailors, of a happy, merry disposition, and, unlike other Africans, will work hard.  Fond of the English, they generally speak the language sufficiently to be understood, and are very glad to receive a baptism when they come on board.  The name first given them they usually adhere to as long as they live; and you will now on the coast meet with a Blucher, a Wellington, a Nelson, etcetera, who will wring swabs, or do any other of the meanest description of work, without feeling that it is discreditable to sponsorials so grand.  It is not to be supposed that these men had voluntarily come on board of the pirate; they had been employed in some British vessels trading on the coast, and had been taken out of them when the vessels were burnt, and the Europeans of the crews murdered.  They had received a promise of reward, if they did their duty; but, not expecting it, they waited for the earliest opportunity to make their escape.  The captain of the schooner is abaft with his glass in his hand, occasionally sweeping the offing in expectation of a vessel heaving in sight: the officers and crew are lying down, or lounging listlessly, about the decks, panting with the extreme heat, and impatiently waiting for the sea-breeze to fan their parched foreheads.  With their rough beards and exposed chests, and their weather-beaten fierce countenances, they form a group which is terrible even in repose.  We must now descend into the cabin of the schooner.  The fittings-up of this apartment are simple: on each side is a standing bed-place; against the after bulkhead is a large buffet, originally intended for glass and china, but now loaded with silver and gold vessels of every size and description, collected by the pirate from the different ships which he had plundered; the lamps are also of silver, and evidently had been intended to ornament the shrine of some Catholic saint.  In this cabin there are two individuals, to whom we shall now direct the reader's attention.  The one is a pleasant-countenanced, good-humoured Krouman, who had been christened ""Pompey the Great;"" most probably on account of his large proportions.  He wears a pair of duck trousers; the rest of his body is naked, and presents a sleek, glossy skin, covering muscle, which an anatomist or a sculptor would have viewed with admiration.  The other is a youth of eighteen, or thereabouts, with an intelligent, handsome countenance, evidently of European blood.  There is, however, an habitually mournful cast upon his features: he is dressed much in the same way as we have described the captain, but the costume hangs more gracefully upon his slender, yet well-formed limbs. He is seated on a sofa, fixed in the fore part of the cabin, with a book in his hand, which occasionally he refers to, and then lifts his eyes from, to watch the motions of the Krouman, who is busy in the office of steward, arranging and cleaning the costly articles in the buffet.  ""Massa Francisco, dis really fine ting,"" said Pompey, holding up a splendidly embossed tankard, which he had been rubbing.  ""Yes,"" replied Francisco, gravely; ""it is, indeed, Pompey.""  ""How Captain Cain came by dis?""  Francisco shook his head, and Pompey put his finger up to his mouth, his eyes, full of meaning, fixed upon Francisco.  At this moment the personage referred to was heard descending the companion-ladder.  Pompey recommenced rubbing the silver, and Francisco dropped his eyes upon the book.  What was the tie which appeared to bind the captain to this lad was not known; but, as the latter had always accompanied, and lived together with him, it was generally supposed that he was the captain's son; and he was as often designated by the crew as young Cain as he was by his Christian name of Francisco.  Still it was observed that latterly they had frequently been heard in altercation, and that the captain was very suspicious of Francisco's movements.  ""I beg I may not interrupt your conversation,"" said Cain, on entering the cabin; ""the information you may obtain from a Krouman must be very important.""  Francisco made no reply, but appeared to be reading his book.  Cain's eyes passed from one to the other, as if to read their thoughts.  ""Pray what were you saying, Mr Pompey?""  ""Me say, Massa Captain? me only tell young Massa dis very fine ting; ask where you get him--Massa Francisco no tell.""  ""And what might it be to you, you black scoundrel?"" cried the captain, seizing the goblet, and striking the man with it a blow on the head which flattened the vessel, and at the same time felled the Krouman, powerful as he was, to the deck.  The blood streamed, as the man slowly rose, stupefied and trembling from the violent concussion.  Without saying a word, he staggered out of the cabin, and Cain threw himself on one of the lockers in front of the standing bed-place, saying, with a bitter smile, ""So much for your intimates, Francisco!""  ""Rather, so much for your cruelty and injustice towards an unoffending man,"" replied Francisco, laying his book on the table.  ""His question was an innocent one,--for he knew not the particulars connected with the obtaining of that flagon.""  ""And you, I presume, do not forget them?  Well, be it so, young man; but I warn you again--as I have warned you often--nothing but the remembrance of your mother has prevented me, long before this, from throwing your body to the sharks.""  ""What influence my mother's memory may have over you, I know not; I only regret that, in any way, she had the misfortune to be connected with you.""  ""She had the influence,"" replied Cain, ""which a woman must have over a man when they have for years swung in the same cot; but that is wearing off fast.  I tell you so candidly; I will not [even] allow even her memory to check me, if I find you continue your late course.  You have shown disaffection before the crew--you have disputed my orders--and I have every reason to believe that you are now plotting against me.""  ""Can I do otherwise than show my abhorrence,"" replied Francisco, ""when I witness such acts of horror, of cruelty--cold-blooded cruelty, as lately have been perpetrated?  Why do you bring me here? and why do you now detain me?  All I ask is, that you will allow me to leave the vessel. You are not my father; you have told me so.""  ""No, I am not your father; but--you are your mother's son.""  ""That gives you no right to have power over me, even if you had been married to my mother; which--""  ""I was not.""  ""I thank God; for marriage with you would have been even greater disgrace.""  ""What!"" cried Cain, starting up, seizing the young man by the neck, and lifting him off his seat as if he had been a puppet; ""but no--I cannot forget your mother.""  Cain released Francisco, and resumed his seat on the locker.  ""As you please,"" said Francisco, as soon as he had recovered himself; ""it matters little whether I am brained by your own hand, or launched overboard as a meal for the sharks; it will be but one more murder.""  ""Mad fool! why do you tempt me thus?"" replied Cain, again starting up, and hastily quitting the cabin.  The altercation which we have just described was not unheard on deck, as the doors of the cabin were open, and the skylight removed to admit the air.  The face of Cain was flushed as he ascended the ladder.  He perceived his chief mate standing by the hatchway, and many of the men, who had been slumbering abaft, with their heads raised on their elbows, as if they had been listening to the conversation below.  ""It will never do, sir,"" said Hawkhurst, the mate, shaking his head.  ""No,"" replied the captain; ""not if he were my own son.  But what is to be done?--he knows no fear.""  Hawkhurst pointed to the entering port.  ""When I ask your advice, you may give it,"" said the captain, turning gloomily away.  In the meantime, Francisco paced the cabin in deep thought.  Young as he was, he was indifferent to death; for he had no tie to render life precious.  He remembered his mother, but not her demise; that had been concealed from him.  At the age of seven he had sailed with Cain in a slaver, and had ever since continued with him.  Until lately, he had been led to suppose that the captain was his father.  During the years that he had been in the slave-trade, Cain had devoted much time to his education; it so happened that the only book which could be found on board of the vessel, when Cain first commenced teaching, was a Bible belonging to Francisco's mother.  Out of this book he learned to read; and, as his education advanced, other books were procured.  It may appear strange that the very traffic in which his reputed father was engaged did not corrupt the boy's mind, but, accustomed to it from his infancy, he had considered these negroes as another species,--an idea fully warranted by the cruelty of the Europeans towards them.  There are some dispositions so naturally kind and ingenuous that even example and evil contact cannot debase them: such was the disposition of Francisco.  As he gained in years and knowledge, he thought more and more for himself, and had already become disgusted with the cruelties practised upon the unfortunate negroes, when the slave-vessel was seized upon by Cain and converted into a pirate.  At first, the enormities committed had not been so great; vessels had been seized and plundered, but life had been spared.  In the course of crime, however, the descent is rapid: and as, from information given by those who had been released, the schooner was more than once in danger of being captured, latterly no lives had been spared; and but too often the murders had been attended with deeds even more atrocious.  Francisco had witnessed scenes of horror until his young blood curdled: he had expostulated to save, but in vain.  Disgusted with the captain and the crew, and their deeds of cruelty, he had latterly expressed his opinions fearlessly, and defied the captain; for, in the heat of an altercation, Cain had acknowledged that Francisco was not his son.  Had any of the crew or officers expressed but a tithe of what had fallen from the bold lips of Francisco, they would have long before paid the forfeit of their temerity; but there was a feeling towards Francisco which could not be stifled in the breast of Cain--it was the feeling of association and habit.  The boy had been his companion for years: and from assuetude had become, as it were, a part of himself.  There is a principle in our nature which, even when that nature is most debased, will never leave us--that of requiring something to love, something to protect and watch over: it is shown towards a dog, or any other animal, if it cannot be lavished upon one of our own species.  Such was the feeling which so forcibly held Cain towards Francisco; such was the feeling which had hitherto saved his life.  After having paced up and down for some time, the youth took his seat on the locker which the captain had quitted: his eye soon caught the head of Pompey, who looked into the cabin and beckoned with his finger.  Francisco rose, and, taking up a flagon from the buffet which contained some spirits, walked to the door, and, without saying a word, handed it to the Krouman.  ""Massa Francisco,"" whispered Pompey, ""Pompey say--all Kroumen say-- suppose they run away, you go too?  Pompey say--all Kroumen say--suppose they try to kill you?  Nebber kill you while one Krouman alive.""  The negro then gently pushed Francisco back with his hand, as if not wishing to hear his answer, and hastened forward on the berth deck.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  THE ATTACK.  In the meantime, the sea-breeze had risen in the offing, and was sweeping along the surface to where the schooner was at anchor.  The captain ordered a man to the cross-trees, directing him to keep a good look-out, while he walked the deck in company with his first mate.  ""She may not have sailed until a day or two later,"" said the captain, continuing the conversation; ""I have made allowance for that, and, depend upon it, as she makes the eastern passage, we must soon fall in with her; if she does not heave in sight this evening, by daylight I shall stretch out in the offing; I know the Portuguese well.  The sea-breeze has caught our craft: let them run up the inner jib, and see that she does not foul her anchor.""  It was now late in the afternoon, and dinner had been sent into the cabin; the captain descended, and took his seat at the table with Francisco, who ate in silence.  Once or twice the captain, whose wrath had subsided, and whose kindly feelings towards Francisco, checked for a time, had returned with greater force, tried, but in vain, to rally him to conversation, when ""_Sail ho_!"" was shouted from the mast-head.  ""There she is, by God!"" cried the captain, jumping from, and then, as if checking himself, immediately resuming, his seat.  Francisco put his hand to his forehead, covering his eyes as his elbow leant upon the table.  ""A large ship, sir; we can see down to the second reef of her topsails,"" said Hawkhurst, looking down the skylight.  The captain hastily swallowed some wine from a flagon, cast a look of scorn and anger upon Francisco, and rushed on deck.  ""Be smart, lads!"" cried the captain, after a few seconds' survey of the vessel through his glass; ""that's her: furl the awnings, and run the anchor up to the bows: there's more silver in that vessel, my lads, than your chests will hold: and the good saints of the churches at Goa will have to wait a little longer for their gold candlesticks.""  The crew were immediately on the alert; the awnings were furled, and all the men, stretching aft the spring cable, walked the anchor up to the bows.  In two minutes more the _Avenger_ was standing out on the starboard tack, shaping her course so as to cut off the ill-fated vessel.  The breeze freshened, and the schooner darted through the smooth water with the impetuosity of a dolphin after its prey.  In an hour the hull of the ship was plainly to be distinguished; but the sun was near to the horizon, and before they could ascertain what their force might be, daylight had disappeared.  Whether the schooner had been perceived or not, it was impossible to say; at all events, the course of the ship had not been altered, and if she had seen the schooner, she evidently treated her with contempt.  On board the _Avenger_, they were not idle; the long gun in the centre had been cleared from the incumbrances which surrounded it, the other guns had been cast loose, shot handed up, and everything prepared for action, with all the energy and discipline of a man-of-war.  The chase had not been lost sight of, the eyes of the pirate-captain were fixed upon her through a night-glass.  In about an hour more the schooner was within a mile of the ship, and now altered her course so as to range up within a cable's length of her to leeward.  Cain stood upon the gunwale and hailed.  The answer was in Portuguese.  ""Heave to, or I'll sink you!"" replied he in the same language.  A general discharge from a broadside of carronades, and a heavy volley of muskets from the Portuguese, was the decided answer.  The broadside, too much elevated to hit the low hull of the schooner, was still not without effect--the foretopmast fell, the jaws of the main-gaff were severed, and a large proportion of the standing as well as the running rigging came rattling down on her decks.  The volley of musketry was more fatal: thirteen of the pirates were wounded, some of them severely.  ""Well done!  John Portuguese,"" cried Hawkhurst: ""by the holy poker!  I never gave you credit for so much pluck.""  ""Which they shall dearly pay for,"" was the cool reply of Cain, as he still remained in his exposed situation.  ""Blood for blood! if I drink it,"" observed the second mate, as he looked at the crimson rivulet trickling down the fingers of his left hand from a wound in his arm--""just tie my handkerchief round this, Bill.""  In the interim, Cain had desired his crew to elevate their guns, and the broadside was returned.  ""That will do, my lads: starboard; ease off the boom-sheet; let her go right round, Hawkhurst,--we cannot afford to lose our men.""  The schooner wore round, and ran astern of her opponent.  The Portuguese on board the ship, imagining that the schooner, finding she had met with unexpected resistance, had sheered off, gave a loud cheer.  ""The last you will ever give, my fine fellows!"" observed Cain, with a sneer.  In a few moments the schooner had run a mile astern of the ship.  ""Now then, Hawkhurst, let her come too and about; man the long gun, and see that every shot is pitched into her, while the rest of them get up a new foretopmast, and knot and splice the rigging.""  The schooner's head was again turned towards the ship; her position was right astern, about a mile distant or rather more; the long 82-pounder gun amidships was now regularly served, every shot passing through the cabin-windows, or some other part of the ship's stern, raking her fore and aft.  In vain did the ship alter her course, and present her broadside to the schooner; the latter was immediately checked in her speed, so as to keep the prescribed distance at which the carronades of the ship were useless, and the execution from the long gun decisive. The ship was at the mercy of the pirate; and, as may be expected, no mercy was shown.  For three hours did this murderous attack continue, when the gun, which, as before observed, was of brass, became so heated that the pirate-captain desired his men to discontinue.  Whether the ship had surrendered or not it was impossible to say, as it was too dark to distinguish: while the long gun was served, the foretop-mast and main-gaff had been shifted, and all the standing and running rigging made good; the schooner keeping her distance, and following in the wake of the ship until daylight.  We must now repair on board of the ship; she was an Indiaman; one of the very few that occasionally are sent out by the Portuguese government to a country which once owned their undivided sway, but in which, at present, they hold but a few miles of territory.  She was bound to Goa, and had on board a small detachment of troops, a new governor and his two sons, a bishop and his niece, with her attendant.  The sailing of a vessel with such a freight was a circumstance of rare occurrence, and was, of course, generally bruited about long before her departure.  Cain had, for some months, received all the necessary intelligence relative to her cargo and destination; but, as usual with the Portuguese of the present day, delay upon delay had followed, and it was not until about three weeks previous that he had been assured of her immediate departure.  He then ran down the coast to the bay we have mentioned, that he might intercept her; and, as the event had proved, showed his usual judgment and decision.  The fire of the schooner had been most destructive; many of the Indiaman's crew, as well as of the troops, had been mowed down one after another; until at last, finding that all their efforts to defend themselves were useless, most of those who were still unhurt had consulted their safety, and hastened down to the lowest recesses of the hold to avoid the raking and destructive shot.  At the time that the schooner had discontinued her fire to allow the gun to cool, there was no one on deck but the Portuguese captain and one old weatherbeaten seaman who stood at the helm.  Below, in the orlop-deck, the remainder of the crew and the passengers were huddled together in a small space: some were attending to the wounded, who were numerous; others were invoking the saints to their assistance; the bishop, a tall, dignified person, apparently nearly sixty years of age, was kneeling in the centre of the group, which was dimly lighted by two or three lanterns, at one time in fervent prayer, at another, interrupted, that he might give absolution to those wounded men whose spirits were departing, and who were brought down and laid before him by their comrades.  On one side of him knelt his orphan niece, a young girl of about seventeen years of age, watching his countenance as he prayed, or bending down with a look of pity and tearful eyes on her expiring countrymen, whose last moments were gladdened by his holy offices.  On the other side of the bishop, stood the governor, Don Philip de Ribiera, and his two sons, youths in their prime, and holding commissions in the king's service.  There was melancholy on the brow of Don Ribiera; he was prepared for, and he anticipated, the worst.  The eldest son had his eyes fixed upon the sweet countenance of Teresa de Silva--that very evening, as they walked together on the deck, had they exchanged their vows--that very evening they had luxuriated in the present, and had dwelt with delightful anticipation on the future.  But we must leave them and return on deck.  The captain of the Portuguese ship had walked aft, and now went up to Antonio, the old seaman, who was standing at the wheel.  ""I still see her with the glass, Antonio, and yet she has not fired for nearly two hours; do you think any accident has happened to her long gun? if so, we may have some chance.""  Antonio shook his head.  ""We have but little chance, I am afraid, my captain; I knew by the ring of the gun, when she fired it, that it was brass; indeed, no schooner could carry a long iron gun of that calibre. Depend upon it, she only waits for the metal to cool and daylight to return: a long gun or two might have saved us; but now, as she has the advantage of us in heels, we are at her mercy.""  ""What can she be--a French privateer?""  ""I trust it may be so; and I have promised a silver candlestick to St. Antonio that it may prove no worse: we then may have some chance of seeing our homes again; but I fear not.""  ""What, then, do you imagine her to be, Antonio?""  ""The pirate which we have heard so much of.""  ""Jesu protect us! we must then sell our lives as dearly as we can.""  ""So I intend to do, my captain,"" replied Antonio, shifting the helm a spoke.  The day broke, and showed the schooner continuing her pursuit at the same distance astern, without any apparent movement on board.  It was not until the sun was some degrees above the horizon that the smoke was again seen to envelop her bows, and the shot crashed through the timbers of the Portuguese ship.  The reason for this delay was, that the pirate waited till the sun was up to ascertain if there were any other vessels to be seen, previous to his pouncing on his quarry.  The Portuguese captain went aft and hoisted his ensign, but no flag was shown by the schooner.  Again whistled the ball, and again did it tear up the decks of the unfortunate ship: many of those who had re-ascended to ascertain what was going on, now hastily sought their former retreat.  ""Mind the helm, Antonio,"" said the Portuguese captain; ""I must go down and consult with the governor.""  ""Never fear, my captain; as long as these limbs hold together, I will do my duty,"" replied the old man, exhausted as he was by long watching and fatigue.  The captain descended to the orlop-deck, where he found the major part of the crew and passengers assembled.  ""My lords,"" said he, addressing the governor and the bishop, ""the schooner has not shown any colours, although our own are hoisted.  I am come down to know your pleasure.  Defence we can make none; and I fear that we are at the mercy of a pirate.""  ""A pirate!"" ejaculated several, beating their breasts, and calling upon their saints.  ""Silence, my good people, silence,"" quietly observed the bishop; ""as to what it may be best to do,"" continued he, turning to the captain, ""I cannot advise; I am a man of peace, and unfit to hold a place in a council of war.  Don Ribiera, I must refer the point to you and your sons.  Tremble not, my dear Teresa; are we not under the protection of the Almighty?""  ""Holy Virgin, pity us!""  ""Come, my sons,"" said Don Ribiera, ""we will go on deck and consult: let not any of the men follow us; it is useless risking lives which may yet be valuable.""  Don Ribiera and his sons followed the captain to the quarter deck, and with him and Antonio they held a consultation.  ""We have but one chance,"" observed the old man, after a time: ""let us haul down our colours as if in submission; they will then range up alongside, and either board us from the schooner, or from their boats; at all events, we shall find out what she is, and, if a pirate, we must sell our lives as dearly as we can.  If, when we haul down the colours, she ranges up alongside, as I expect she will, let all the men be prepared for a desperate struggle.""  ""You are right, Antonio,"" replied the governor; ""go aft captain, and haul down the colours!--let us see what she does now.  Down, my boys! and prepare the men to do their duty.""  As Antonio had predicted, so soon as the colours were hauled down, the schooner ceased firing and made sail.  She ranged up on the quarter of the ship, and up to her main peak soared the terrific black flag; her broadside was poured into the Indiaman, and before the smoke had cleared away there was a concussion from the meeting sides, and the bearded pirates poured upon her decks.  The crew of the Portuguese, with the detachment of troops, still formed a considerable body of men.  The sight of the black flag had struck ice into every heart, but the feeling was resolved into one of desperation.  ""Knives, men, knives!"" roared Antonio, rushing on to the attack, followed by the most brave.  ""Blood for blood!"" cried the second mate, aiming a blow at the old man.  ""You have it,"" replied Antonio, as his knife entered the pirate's heart, while, at the same moment, he fell and was himself a corpse.  The struggle was deadly, but the numbers and ferocity of the pirates prevailed.  Cain rushed forward followed by Hawkhurst, bearing down all who opposed them.  With one blow from the pirate-captain, the head of Don Ribiera was severed to the shoulder; a second struck down the eldest son, while the sword of Hawkhurst passed through the body of the other. The Portuguese captain had already fallen, and the men no longer stood their ground.  A general massacre ensued, and the bodies were thrown overboard as fast as the men were slaughtered.  In less than five minutes there was not a living Portuguese on the bloody decks of the ill-fated ship.    CHAPTER NINE.  THE CAPTURE.  ""Pass the word for not a man to go below, Hawkhurst,"" said the pirate-captain.  ""I have, sir; and sentries are stationed at the hatchways.  Shall we haul the schooner off?""  ""No, let her remain; the breeze is faint already: we shall have a calm in half an hour.  Have we lost many men?""  ""Only seven, that I can reckon; but we have lost Wallace,"" (the second mate).  ""A little promotion will do no harm,"" replied Cain; ""take a dozen of our best men and search the ship, there are others alive yet.  By-the-by, send a watch on board of the schooner; she is left to the mercy of the Kroumen, and--""  ""One who is better out of her,"" replied Hawkhurst.  ""And those we find below--"" continued the mate.  ""Alive!""  ""True; we may else be puzzled where to find that portion of her cargo which suits us,"" said Hawkhurst, going down the hatchway to collect the men who were plundering on the main deck and in the captain's cabin.  ""Here, you Maltese! up, there! and look well round if there is anything in sight,"" said the captain, walking aft.  Before Hawkhurst had collected the men and ordered them on board of the schooner, as usual in those latitudes, it had fallen a perfect calm.  Where was Francisco during this scene of blood?  He had remained in the cabin of the schooner.  Cain had more than once gone down to him, to persuade him to come on deck and assist at the boarding of the Portuguese, but in vain--his sole reply to the threats and solicitations of the pirate was--  ""Do with me as you please--I have made up my mind--you know I do not fear death--as long as I remain on board of this vessel, I will take no part in your atrocities.  If you do respect my mother's memory, suffer her son to seek an honest and honourable livelihood.""  The words of Francisco were ringing in the ears of Cain as he walked up and down on the quarter-deck of the Portuguese vessel, and, debased as he was, he could not help thinking that the youth was his equal in animal, and his superior in mental, courage--he was arguing in his own mind upon the course he should pursue with respect to Francisco, when Hawkhurst made his appearance on deck, followed by his men, who dragged up six individuals who had escaped the massacre.  These were the bishop; his niece, a Portuguese girl; her attendant; the supercargo of the vessel; a sacristan; and a servant of the ecclesiastic; they were hauled along the deck and placed in a row before the captain, who cast his eye upon them in severe scrutiny.  The bishop and his niece looked round, the one proudly meeting the eye of Cain, although he felt that his hour was come; the other carefully avoiding his gaze, and glancing round to ascertain whether there were any other prisoners, and if so, if her betrothed was amongst them; but her eye discovered not what she sought-- it was met only by the bearded faces of the pirate-crew, and the blood which bespattered the deck.  She covered her face with her hands.  ""Bring that man forward,"" said Cain, pointing to the servant.  ""Who are you.""  ""A servant of my lord the bishop.""  ""And you?"" continued the captain.  ""A poor sacristan attending upon my lord the bishop.""  ""And you?"" cried he to a third.  ""The supercargo of this vessel.""  ""Put him aside, Hawkhurst!""  ""Do you want the others?"" inquired Hawkhurst significantly.  ""No.""  Hawkhurst gave a signal to some of the pirates, who led away the sacristan and the servant.  A stifled shriek and a heavy plunge in the water were heard a few seconds after.  During this time the pirate had been questioning the supercargo as to the contents of the vessel, and her stowage, when he was suddenly interrupted by one of the pirates, who in a hurried voice, stated that the ship had received several shot between wind and water, and was sinking fast.  Cain, who was standing on the side of the carronade with his sword in his hand, raised his arm and struck the pirate a blow on the head with the hilt, which, whether intended or not, fractured his skull, and the man fell upon the deck.  ""Take that, babbler! for your intelligence; if these men are obstinate, we may have worked for nothing.""  The crew, who felt the truth of their captain's remark, did not appear to object to the punishment inflicted, and the body of the man was dragged away.  ""What mercy can we expect from those who show no mercy even to each other?"" observed the bishop, lifting his eyes to heaven.  ""Silence!"" cried Cain, who now interrogated the supercargo as to the contents of the hold--the poor man answered as well as he could--""the plate! the money for the troops--where are they?""  ""The money for the troops is in the spirit-room, but of the plate I know nothing; it is in some of the cases belonging to my lord the bishop.""  ""Hawkhurst! down at once into the spirit-room, and see to the money; in the mean time I will ask a few questions of this reverend father.""  ""And the supercargo--do you want him any more?""  ""No; he may go.""  The poor man fell down on his knees in thankfulness at what he considered his escape: he was dragged away by the pirates, and, it is scarcely necessary to add that in a minute his body was torn to pieces by the sharks, who, scenting their prey from a distance, were now playing in shoals around the two vessels.  The party on the quarter-deck were now (unperceived by the captain) joined by Francisco, who, hearing from the Krouman, Pompey, that there were prisoners still on board, and amongst them two females, had come over to plead the cause of mercy.  ""Most reverend father,"" observed Cain, after a short pause, ""you have many articles of value in this vessel?""  ""None,"" replied the bishop, ""except this poor girl; she is, indeed, beyond price, and will, I trust, soon be an angel in heaven.""  ""Yet is this world, if what you preach be true, a purgatory which must be passed through previous to arriving there, and that girl may think death a blessing compared to what she may expect if you refuse to tell me what I would know.  You have good store of gold and silver ornaments for your churches--where are they?""  ""They are among the packages intrusted to my care.""  ""How many may you have in all?""  ""A hundred, if not more.""  ""Will you deign to inform me where I may find what I require?""  ""The gold and silver are not mine, but are the property of that God to whom they have been dedicated,"" replied the bishop.  ""Answer quickly; no more subterfuge, good sir.  Where is it to be found?""  ""I will not tell, thou blood-stained man; at least; in this instance, there shall be disappointment, and the sea shall swallow up those earthly treasures to obtain which thou hast so deeply imbrued thy hands. Pirate!  I repeat it, I will not tell.""  ""Seize that girl, my lads!"" cried Cain; ""she is yours, do with her as you please.""  ""Save me! oh, save me!"" shrieked Teresa, clinging to the bishop's robe.  The pirates advanced and laid hold of Teresa.  Francisco bounded from where he stood behind the captain, and dashed away the foremost.  ""Are you men?"" cried he, as the pirates retreated.  ""Holy sir, I honour you.  Alas!  I cannot save you,"" continued Francisco, mournfully.  ""Yet will I try.  On my knees--by the love you bore my mother--by the affection you once bore me--do not commit this horrid deed.  My lads!"" continued Francisco, appealing to the pirates, ""join with me and entreat your captain; ye are too brave, too manly, to injure the helpless and the innocent--above all, to shed the blood of a holy man, and of this poor trembling maiden.""  There was a pause--even the pirates appeared to side with Francisco, though none of them dared to speak.  The muscles of the captain's face quivered with emotion, but from what source could not be ascertained.  At this moment the interest of the scene was heightened.  The girl who attended upon Teresa, crouched on her knees with terror, had been casting her fearful eyes upon the men who composed the pirate-crew; suddenly she uttered a scream of delight as she discovered among them one that she well knew.  He was a young man, about twenty-five years of age, with little or no beard.  He had been her lover in his more innocent days; and she, for more than a year, had mourned him as dead, for the vessel in which he sailed had never been heard of.  It had been taken by the pirate, and, to save his life, he had joined the crew.  ""Filippo!  Filippo!"" screamed the girl, rushing into his arms. ""Mistress! it is Filippo; and we are safe.""  Filippo instantly recognised her: the sight of her brought back to his memory his days of happiness and of innocence; and the lovers were clasped in each other's arms.  ""Save them! spare them!--by the spirit of my mother!  I charge you,"" repeated Francisco, again appealing to the captain.  ""May God bless thee, thou good young man!"" said the bishop, advancing and placing his hand upon Francisco's head.  Cain answered not; but his broad expanded chest heaved with emotion-- when Hawkhurst burst into the group.  ""We are too late for the money, captain: the water is already six feet above it.  We must now try for the treasure.""  This intelligence appeared to check the current of the captain's feelings.  ""Now, in one word, sir,"" said he to the bishop, ""where is the treasure? Trifle not, or, by Heaven--!""  ""Name not Heaven,"" replied the bishop; ""you have had my answer.""  The captain turned away, and gave some directions to Hawkhurst, who hastened below.  ""Remove that boy,"" said Cain to the pirates, pointing to Francisco, ""Separate those two fools,"" continued he, looking towards Filippo and the girl, who were sobbing in each other's arms.  ""Never!"" cried Filippo.  ""Throw the girl to the sharks!  Do you hear?  Am I to be obeyed?"" cried Cain, raising his cutlass.  Filippo started up, disengaged himself from the girl, and, drawing his knife, rushed towards the captain to plunge it in his bosom.  With the quickness of lightning the captain caught his uplifted hand, and, breaking his wrist, hurled him to the deck.  ""Indeed!"" cried he, with a sneer.  ""You shall not separate us,"" said Filippo, attempting to rise.  ""I do not intend it, my good lad,"" replied Cain.  ""Lash them both together and launch them overboard.""  This order was obeyed: for the pirates not only quailed before the captain's cool courage, but were indignant that his life had been attempted.  There was little occasion to tie the unhappy pair together; they were locked so fast in each other's arms that it would have been impossible almost to separate them.  In this state they were carried to the entering-port, and cast into the sea.  ""Monster!"" cried the bishop, as he heard the splash, ""thou wilt have a heavy reckoning for this.""  ""Now bring these forward,"" said Cain, with a savage voice.  The bishop and his niece were led to the gangway.  ""What dost thou see, good bishop?"" said Cain pointing to the discoloured water, and the rapid motion of the fins of the sharks, eager in the anticipation of a further supply.  ""I see ravenous creatures after their kind,"" replied the bishop, ""who will, in all probability, soon tear asunder those poor limbs; but I see no monster like thyself.  Teresa, dearest, fear not; there is a God, an avenging God; as well as a rewarding one.""  But Teresa's eyes were closed--she could not look upon the scene.  ""You have your choice; first torture, and then your body to those sharks for your own portion: and as for the girl, this moment I hand her over to my crew.""  ""Never!"" shrieked Teresa, springing from the deck and plunging into the wave.  There was a splash of contention, the lashing of tails, until the water was in a foam, and then the dark colour gradually cleared away, and nought was to be seen, but the pure blue wave and the still unsatisfied monsters of the deep.  ""The screws--the screws! quick! we'll have the secret from him,"" cried the pirate-captain, turning to his crew, who, villains as they were, had been shocked at this last catastrophe.  ""Seize him!""  ""Touch him not!"" cried Francisco, standing on the hammock-netting; ""touch him not! if you are men.""  Boiling with rage, Cain let go the arm of the bishop, drew his pistol, and levelled it at Francisco.  The bishop threw up the arm of Cain as he fired; saw that he had missed his aim, and clasping his hands, raised his eyes to heaven in thankfulness at Francisco's escape.  In this position he was collared by Hawkhurst, whose anger overcame his discretion, and who hurled him through the entering-port into the sea.  ""Officious fool!"" muttered Cain, when he perceived what the mate had done.  Then, recollecting himself, he cried,--""Seize that boy and bring him here.""  One or two of the crew advanced to obey his orders; but Pompey and the Kroumen, who had been attentive to what was going on, had collected round Francisco, and a scuffle ensued.  The pirates, not being very determined, nor very anxious to take Francisco, allowed him to be hurried away in the centre of the Kroumen, who bore him safely to the schooner.  In the meantime Hawkhurst, and the major part of the men on board of the ship, had been tearing up the hold to obtain the valuables, but without success.  The water had now reached above the orlop-deck, and all further attempts were unavailing.  The ship was settling fast, and it became necessary to quit her, and haul off the schooner; that she might not be endangered by the vortex of the sinking vessel.  Cain and Hawkhurst, with their disappointed crew, returned on board the schooner, and before they had succeeded in detaching the two vessels a cable's length the ship went down with all the treasure so coveted.  The indignation and rage which were expressed by the captain as he rapidly walked the deck in company with his first mate--his violent gesticulation--proved to the crew that there was mischief brewing. Francisco did not return to the cabin; he remained forward with the Kroumen, who, although but a small portion of the ship's company, were known to be resolute and not to be despised.  It was also observed that all of them had supplied themselves with arms, and were collected forward, huddled together, watching every motion and manoeuvre, and talking rapidly in their own language.  The schooner was now steered to the north-westward under all press of sail.  The sun again disappeared, but Francisco returned not to the cabin--he went below, surrounded by the Kroumen, who appeared to have devoted themselves to his protection. Once during the night Hawkhurst summoned them on deck, but they obeyed not the order; and to the expostulation of the boatswain's mate, who came down, they made no reply.  But there were many of the pirates in the schooner who appeared to coincide with the Kroumen in their regard for Francisco.  There are shades of villainy in the most profligate of societies; and among the pirate's crew some were not yet wholly debased. The foul murder of a holy man--the cruel fate of the beautiful Teresa-- and the barbarous conduct of the captain towards Filippo and his mistress, were deeds of an atrocity to which even the most hardened were unaccustomed.  Francisco's pleadings in behalf of mercy were at least no crime; and yet they considered that Francisco was doomed.  He was a general favourite; the worst-disposed of the pirates, with the exception of Hawkhurst, if they did not love him, could not forbear respecting him; although at the same time they felt that if Francisco remained on board the power even of Cain himself would soon be destroyed.  For many months Hawkhurst, who detested the youth, had been most earnest that he should be sent out of the schooner.  Now he pressed the captain for his removal in any way, as necessary for their mutual safety, pointing out to Cain the conduct of the Kroumen, and his fears that a large proportion of the ship's company were equally disaffected.  Cain felt the truth of Hawkhurst's representation, and he went down to his cabin to consider upon what should be done.  It was past midnight, when Cain, worn out with the conflicting passions of the day, fell into an uneasy slumber.  His dreams were of Francisco's mother--she appeared to him pleading for her son, and Cain ""babbled in his sleep.""  At this time Francisco, with Pompey, had softly crawled aft, that they might obtain, if they found the captain asleep, the pistols of Francisco, with some ammunition.  Pompey slipped in first, and started back when he heard the captain's voice.  They remained at the cabin-door listening.  ""No, no,"" murmured Cain, ""he must die-- useless--plead not, woman!--I know I murdered thee--plead not, he dies!""  In one of the sockets of the silver lamp there was a lighted wick, the rays of which were sufficient to afford a dim view of the cabin. Francisco, overhearing the words of Cain, stepped in, and walked up to the side of the bed.  ""Boy! plead not,"" continued Cain, lying on his back and breathing heavily--""plead not--woman!--to-morrow he dies.""  A pause ensued, as if the sleeping man was listening to a reply.  ""Yes, as I murdered thee, so will I murder him.""  ""Wretch!"" said Francisco, in a low, solemn voice, ""didst thou kill my mother?""  ""I did--I did!"" responded Cain, still sleeping.  ""And why?"" continued Francisco, who at this acknowledgment on the part of the sleeping captain was careless of discovery.  ""In my mood she vexed me,"" answered Cain.  ""Fiend; thou hast then confessed it!"" cried Francisco in a loud voice, which awoke the captain, who started up; but before his senses were well recovered, or his eyes open so as to distinguish their forms, Pompey struck out the light, and all was darkness; he then put his hand to Francisco's mouth, and led him out of the cabin.  ""Who's there?--who's there?"" cried Cain.  The officer in charge of the deck hastened down.  ""Did you call, sir?""  ""Call!"" repeated the captain.  ""I thought there was some one in the cabin.  I want a light--that's all,"" continued he, recovering himself, as he wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead.  In the meantime Francisco, with Pompey, had gained his former place of refuge with the Kroumen.  The feelings of the young man changed from agony to revenge; his object in returning to the cabin to recover his weapons had been frustrated, but his determination now was to take the life of the captain if he possibly could.  The following morning the Kroumen again refused to work or go on deck; and the state of affairs was reported by Hawkhurst to his chief.  The mate now assumed another tone: for he had sounded not the majority but the most steady and influential men on board, who, like himself, were veterans in crime.  ""It must be, sir; or you will no longer command this vessel.  I am desired to say so.""  ""Indeed!"" replied Cain, with a sneer.  ""Perhaps you have already chosen my successor?""  Hawkhurst perceived that he had lost ground, and he changed his manner. ""I speak but for yourself: if you do not command this vessel I shall not remain in her: if you quit her, I quit also; and we must find another.""  Cain was pacified, and the subject was not renewed.  ""Turn the hands up,"" at last said the captain.  The pirate-crew assembled aft.  ""My lads, I am sorry that our laws oblige me to make an example; but mutiny and disaffection must be punished.  I am equally bound as yourselves by the laws which we have laid down for our guidance while we sail together; and you may believe that in doing my duty in this instance I am guided by a sense of justice, and wish to prove to you that I am worthy to command.  Francisco has been with me since he was a child; he has lived with me, and it is painful to part with him: but I am here to see that our laws are put in force.  He has been guilty of repeated mutiny and contempt, and--he must die.""  ""Death! death!"" cried several of the pirates in advance: ""death and justice!""  ""No more murder!"" said several voices from behind.  ""Who's that that speaks?""  ""Too much murder yesterday--no more murder!"" shouted several voices at once.  ""Let the men come forward who speak,"" cried Cain with a withering look. No one obeyed this order.  ""Down, then, my men! and bring up Francisco.""  The whole of the pirate-crew hastened below, but with different intentions.  Some were determined to seize Francisco, and hand him over to death--others to protect him.  A confused noise was heard--the shouts of ""_Down and seize him_!"" opposed to those of ""_No murder!  No murder_!""  Both parties had snatched up their arms; those who sided with Francisco joined the Kroumen, whilst the others also hastened below to bring him on deck.  A slight scuffle ensued before they separated, and ascertained by the separation the strength of the contending parties.  Francisco, perceiving that he was joined by a large body, desired his men to follow him, went up the fore-ladder, and took possession of the forecastle. The pirates on his side supplied him with arms, and Francisco stood forward in advance.  Hawkhurst, and those of the crew who sided with him, had retreated to the quarter-deck, and rallied round the captain, who leaned against the capstern.  They were then able to estimate their comparative strength.  The number, on the whole, preponderated in favour of Francisco; but on the captain's side were the older and more athletic of the crew, and, we may add, the more determined.  Still, the captain and Hawkhurst perceived the danger of their situation, and it was thought advisable to parley for the present, and wreak their vengeance hereafter.  For a few minutes there was a low consultation between both parties; at last Cain advanced.  ""My lads,"" said he, addressing those who had rallied round Francisco, ""I little thought that a fire-brand would have been cast in this vessel to set us all at variance.  It was my duty, as your captain, to propose that our laws should be enforced.  Tell me now what is it that you wish. I am only here as your captain, and to take the sense of the whole crew.  I have no animosity against that lad: I have loved him--I have cherished him; but like a viper, he has stung me in return.  Instead of being in arms against each other, ought we not to be united?  I have, therefore, one proposal to make to you, which is this: let the sentence go by vote, or ballot, if you please; and whatever the sentence may be, I shall be guided by it.  Can I say more?""  ""My lads,"" replied Francisco, when the captain had done speaking, ""I think it better that you should accept this proposal rather than that blood should be shed.  My life is of little consequence; say, then, will you agree to the vote, and submit to those laws, which, as the captain says, have been laid down to regulate the discipline of the vessel?""  The pirates on Francisco's side looked round among their party, and, perceiving that they were the most numerous, consented to the proposal; but Hawkhurst stepped forward and observed: ""Of course the Kroumen can have no votes, as they do not belong to the vessel.""  This objection was important, as they amounted to twenty-five, and, after that number was deducted, in all probability, Francisco's adherents would have been in the minority.  The pirates, with Francisco, objected, and again assumed the attitude of defence.  ""One moment,"" said Francisco, stepping in advance; ""before this point is settled, I wish to take the sense of all of you as to another of your laws.  I ask you, Hawkhurst, and all who are now opposed to me, whether you have not one law, which is _Blood for blood_?""  ""Yes--yes,"" shouted all the pirates.  ""Then let your captain stand forward, and answer to my charge, if he dares.""  Cain curled his lip in derision, and walked within two yards of Francisco.  ""Well, boy, I'm here; and what is your charge?""  ""First--I ask you, Captain Cain, who are so anxious that the laws should be enforced, whether you acknowledge that `Blood for blood' is a just law?""  ""Most just: and, when shed, the party who revenges is not amenable.""  ""'Tis well: then villain that thou art, answer--Didst thou not murder my mother?""  Cain, at this accusation, started.  ""Answer the truth, or lie like a recreant!"" repeated Francisco.  ""Did you not murder my mother?""  The captain's lips and the muscles of his face quivered, but he did not reply.  ""_Blood for blood_!"" cried Francisco, as he fired his pistol at Cain, who staggered, and fell on the deck.  Hawkhurst and several of the pirates hastened to the captain, and raised him.  ""She must have told him last night,"" said Cain, speaking with difficulty, as the blood flowed from the wound.  ""He told me so himself,"" said Francisco, turning round to those who stood by him.  Cain was taken down into the cabin.  On examination, his wound was not mortal, although his loss of blood had been rapid and very great.  In a few minutes Hawkhurst joined the party on the quarter deck.  He found that the tide had turned more in Francisco's favour than he had expected; the law of ""Blood for blood"" was held most sacred: indeed, it was but the knowledge that it was solemnly recognised, and that, if one pirate wounded another, the other was at liberty to take his life, without punishment, which prevented constant affrays between parties, whose knives would otherwise have been the answer to every affront.  It was a more debased law of duelling, which kept such profligate associates on good terms.  Finding, therefore, that this feeling predominated, even among those who were opposed to Francisco on the other question, Hawkhurst thought it advisable to parley.  ""Hawkhurst,"" said Francisco, ""I have but one request to make, which, if complied with, will put an end to this contention; it is, that you will put me on shore at the first land that we make.  If you and your party engage to do this, I will desire those who support me to return to their obedience.""  ""I grant it,"" replied Hawkhurst; ""and so will the others.  Will you not, my men?""  ""Agreed--agreed upon all sides,"" cried the pirates, throwing away their weapons, and mingling with each other, as if they had never been opposed.  There is an old saying, that there is honour amongst thieves; and so it often proves.  Every man in the vessel knew that this agreement would be strictly adhered to; and Francisco now walked the deck with as much composure as if nothing had occurred.  Hawkhurst, who was aware that he must fulfil his promise, carefully examined the charts when he went down below, came up and altered the course of the schooner two points more to the northward.  The next morning he was up at the mast-head nearly half an hour, when he descended, and again altered the course.  By nine o'clock a low sandy island appeared on the lee bow; when within half a mile of it, he ordered the schooner to be hove to, and lowered down the small boat from the stern.  He then turned the hands up.  ""My lads, we must keep our promise, to put Francisco on shore at the first land which we made. There it is!""  And a malicious smile played on the miscreant's features as he pointed out to them the barren sand-bank, which promised nothing but starvation and a lingering death.  Several of the crew murmured; but Hawkhurst was supported by his own party, and had, moreover, taken the precaution quietly to remove all the arms, with the exception of those with which his adherents were provided.  ""An agreement is an agreement; it is what he requested himself, and we promised to perform.  Send for Francisco.""  ""I am here, Hawkhurst; and I tell you candidly, that, desolate as is that barren spot, I prefer it to remaining in your company.  I will bring my chest up immediately.""  ""No--no; that was not a part of the agreement,"" cried Hawkhurst.  ""Every man here has a right to his own property: I appeal to the whole of the crew.""  ""True--true,"" replied the pirates; and Hawkhurst found himself again in the minority.  ""Be it so.""  The chest of Francisco was handed into the boat.  ""Is that all?"" cried Hawkhurst.  ""My lads, am I to have no provisions or water?"" inquired Francisco.  ""No,"" replied Hawkhurst.  ""Yes--yes,"" cried most of the pirates.  Hawkhurst did not dare put it to the vote; he turned sulkily away.  The Kroumen brought up two breakers of water, and some pieces of pork.  ""Here, massa,"" said Pompey, putting into Francisco's hand a fishing-line with hooks.  ""Thank you, Pompey; but I had forgot--that book in the cabin--you know which I mean.""  Pompey nodded his head, and went below; but it was some time before he returned, during which Hawkhurst became impatient.  It was a very small boat which had been lowered down; it had a lug-sail and two pair of sculls in it, and was quite full when Francisco's chest and the other articles had been put in.  ""Come!  I have no time to wait,"" said Hawkhurst; ""in the boat!""  Francisco shook hands with many of the crew, and wished all of them farewell.  Indeed, now that they beheld the poor lad about to be cast on the desolate island, even those most opposed to him felt some emotions of pity.  Although they acknowledged that his absence was necessary, yet they knew his determined courage; and with them that quality was always a strong appeal.  ""Who will row this lad ashore, and bring the boat off?""  ""Not I,"" replied one; ""it would haunt me ever afterwards.""  So they all appeared to think, for no one volunteered.  Francisco jumped into the boat.  ""There is no room for any one but me; and I will row myself on shore,"" cried he.  ""Farewell, my lads! farewell!""  ""Stop? not so; he must not have the boat--he may escape from the island,"" cried Hawkhurst.  ""And why shouldn't he, poor fellow?"" replied the men.  ""Let him have the boat.""  ""Yes--yes, let him have the boat;"" and Hawkhurst was again overruled.  ""Here, Massa Francisco--here de book.""  ""What's that, sir?"" cried Hawkhurst, snatching the book out of Pompey's hand.  ""Him, massa, Bible.""  Francisco waited for the book.  ""Shove off!"" cried Hawkhurst.  ""Give me my book, Mr Hawkhurst!""  ""No!"" replied the malignant rascal, tossing the Bible over the taffrail; ""he shall not have that.  I've heard say that _there is consolation in it for the afflicted_.""  Francisco shoved off his boat, and seizing his sculls, pushed astern, picked up the book, which still floated, and laid it to dry on the after-thwart of the boat.  He then pulled in for the shore.  In the meantime the schooner had let draw her fore-sheet, and had already left him a quarter of a mile astern.  Before Francisco had gained the sand-bank she was hull-down to the northward.    CHAPTER TEN.  THE SAND-BANK.  The first half hour that Francisco was on this desolate spot he watched the receding schooner: his thoughts were unconnected and vague. Wandering through the various scenes which had passed on the decks of that vessel, and recalling to his memory the different characters of those on board of her, much as he had longed to quit her--disgusted as he had been with those with whom he had been forced to associate--still, as her sails grew fainter and fainter to his view, as she increased her distance, he more than once felt that even remaining on board of her would have been preferable to his present deserted lot.  ""No, no!"" exclaimed he, after a little further reflection, ""I had rather perish here, than continue to witness the scenes which I have been forced to behold.""  He once more fixed his eyes upon her white sails, and then sat down on the loose sand, and remained in deep and melancholy reverie until the scorching heat reminded him of his situation; he afterwards rose and turned his thoughts upon his present situation, and to what would be the measures most advisable to take.  He hauled his little boat still farther on the beach, and attached the painter to one of the oars, which he fixed deep in the sand; he then proceeded to survey the bank, and found that but a small portion was uncovered at high water; for trifling as was the rise of the tide, the bank was so low that the water flowed almost over it.  The most elevated part was not more than fifteen feet above high-water mark, and that was a small knoll of about fifty feet in circumference.  To this part he resolved to remove his effects: he returned to the boat, and having lifted out his chest, the water, the provisions, with the other articles which he had obtained, he dragged them up, one by one, until they were all collected at the spot he had chosen.  He then took out of the boat the oars and little sail, which, fortunately, had remained in her.  His last object, to haul the little boat up to the same spot, was one which demanded all his exertion; but, after considerable fatigue, he contrived, by first lifting round her bow, and then her stern, to effect his object.  Tired and exhausted, he then repaired to one of the breakers of water and refreshed himself.  The heat, as the day advanced, had become intolerable; but it stimulated him to fresh exertion.  He turned over the boat, and contrived that the bow and stern should rest upon two little hillocks, so as to raise it above the level of the sand beneath it two or three feet; he spread out the sail from the keel above, with the thole-pins as pegs, so as to keep off the rays of the sun.  Dragging the breakers of water and the provisions underneath the boat, he left his chest outside; and having thus formed for himself a sort of covering which would protect him from the heat of the day and the damp of the night, he crept in, to shelter himself until the evening.  Although Francisco had not been on deck, he knew pretty well whereabouts he then was.  Taking out a chart from his chest, he examined the coast to ascertain the probable distance which he might be from any prospect of succour.  He calculated that he was on one of a patch of sand-banks off the coast of Loango, and about seven hundred miles from the Isle of St. Thomas--the nearest place where he might expect to fall in with a European face.  From the coast he felt certain that he could not be more than forty or fifty miles at the most; but could he trust himself among the savage natives who inhabited it?  He knew how ill they had been treated by Europeans; for at that period, it was quite as common for the slave-trader to land and take away the inhabitants as slaves by force, as to purchase them in the more northern territories: still, he might be fortunate enough to fall in with some trader on the coast, as there were a few who still carried on a barter for gold-dust and ivory.  We do not know--we cannot conceive a situation much more deplorable than the one we have just described to have been that of Francisco.  Alone-- without a chance of assistance--with only a sufficiency of food for a few days, and cut off from the rest of his fellow-creatures, with only so much _terra firma_ as would prevent his being swallowed up by the vast, unfathomable ocean, into which the horizon fell on every side around him!  And his chance of escape how small!  Hundreds of miles from any from whom he might expect assistance, and the only means of reaching them a small boat--a mere cockleshell, which the first rough gale would inevitably destroy.  Such, indeed, were the first thoughts of Francisco; but he soon recovered from his despondency.  He was young, courageous, and buoyant with hope; and there is a feeling of pride--of trust in our own resources and exertions, which increases and stimulates us in proportion to our danger and difficulty; it is the daring of the soul, proving its celestial origin and eternal duration.  So intense was the heat that Francisco almost panted for sufficient air to support life, as he lay under the shade of the boat during the whole of that day; not a breath of wind disturbed the glassy wave--all nature appeared hushed into one horrible calm.  It was not until the shades of night were covering the solitude that Francisco ventured forth from his retreat; but he found little relief; there was an unnatural closeness in the air--a suffocation unusual even in those climes.  Francisco cast his eyes up to the vault of heaven, and was astonished to find that there were no stars visible--a grey mist covered the whole firmament.  He directed his view downwards to the horizon, and that, too, was not to be defined; there was a dark bank all around it.  He walked to the edge of the sand-bank; there was not even a ripple--the wide ocean appeared to be in a trance, in a state of lethargy or stupor.  He parted the hair from his feverish brow, and once more surveying the horrible, lifeless, stagnant waste, his soul sickened, and he cast himself upon the sand.  There he lay for many hours in a state bordering upon wild despair.  At last he recovered himself, and, rising to his knees, he prayed for strength and submission to the will of Heaven.  When he was once more upon his feet, and had again scanned the ocean, he perceived that there was a change rapidly approaching.  The dark bank on the horizon had now risen higher up; the opaqueness was everywhere more dense; and low murmurs were heard, as if there was wind stirring aloft, although the sea was still glassy as a lake.  Signs of some movement about to take place were evident, and the solitary youth watched and watched.  And now the sounds increased, and here and there a wild thread of air--whence coming, who could tell? and as rapidly disappearing-- would ruffle, for a second, a portion of the stagnant sea.  Then came whizzing sounds and moans, and then the rumbling noise of distant thunder--loud and louder yet--still louder--a broad black line is seen sweeping along the expanse of water--fearful in its rapidity it comes!-- and the hurricane burst, at once and with all its force, and all its terrific sounds, upon the isolated Francisco.  The first blast was so powerful and so unexpected that it threw him down, and prudence dictated to him to remain in that position, for the loose sand was swept off and whirled in such force as to blind and prevent his seeing a foot from him; he would have crawled to the boat for security, but he knew not in which direction to proceed.  But this did not last; for now the water was borne up upon the strong wings of the hurricane, and the sand was rendered firm by its saturation with the element.  Francisco felt that he was drenched, and he raised his head.  All he could discover was, that the firmament was mantled with darkness, horrible from its intensity, and that the sea was in one extended foam-- boiling everywhere, and white as milk--but still smooth, as if the power of the wind had compelled it to be so; but the water had encroached, and one half the sand-bank was covered with it, while over the other the foam whirled, each portion chasing the other with wild rapidity.  And now the windows of heaven were opened, and the rain, mingled with the spray caught up by the hurricane, was dashed and hurled upon the forlorn youth, who still lay where he had been first thrown down.  But of a sudden, a wash of water told him that he could remain there no longer: the sea was rising--rising fast; and before he could gain a few paces on his hands and knees, another wave, as if it chased him in its wrath, repeated the warning of his extreme danger, and he was obliged to rise on his feet and hasten to the high part of the sand-bank, where he had drawn up his boat and his provisions.  Blinded as he was by the rain and spray, he could distinguish nothing. Of a sudden, he fell violently; he had stumbled over one of the breakers of water, and his head struck against a sea-chest.  Where, then, was the boat?  It was gone!--it must have been swept away by the fury of the wind.  Alas, then, all chance was over! and, if not washed away by the angry waters, he had but to prolong his existence but a few days, and then to die.  The effect of the blow he had received on his forehead, with the shock of mind occasioned by the disappearance of the boat, overpowered him, and he remained for some time in a state of insensibility.  When Francisco recovered, the scene was again changed: the wide expanse was now in a state of wild and fearful commotion, and the water roared as loud as did the hurricane.  The whole sand-bank, with the exception of that part on which he stood, was now covered with tumultuous foam, and his place of refuge was occasionally invaded, when some vast mass, o'erlording the other waves, expended all its fury, even to his feet. Francisco prepared to die!  But gradually the darkness of the heavens disappeared, and there was no longer a bank upon the horizon, and Francisco hoped--alas! hoped what?-- that he might be saved from the present impending death to be reserved for one still more horrible; to be saved from the fury of the waves, which would swallow him up, and in a few seconds remove him from all pain and suffering, to perish for want of sustenance under a burning sun; to be withered--to be parched to death--calling in his agony for water; and as Francisco thought of this he covered his face with his hands, and prayed, ""Oh, God, thy will be done! but in thy mercy, raise, still higher raise the waters!""  But the waters did not rise higher.  The howling of the wind gradually decreased, and the foaming seas had obeyed the Divine injunction--they had gone so far, but no farther!  And the day dawned, and the sky cleared: and the first red tints, announcing the return of light and heat, had appeared on the broken horizon, when the eyes of the despairing youth were directed to a black mass on the tumultuous waters. It was a vessel, with but one mast standing, rolling heavily, and running before the gale right on for the sand-bank where he stood; her hull, one moment borne aloft and the next disappearing from his view in the hollow of the agitated waters.  ""She will be dashed to pieces!"" thought Francisco; ""she will be lost!--they cannot see the bank!""  And he would have made a signal to her, if he had been able, to warn her of her danger, forgetting at the time his own desolate situation.  As Francisco watched, the sun rose, bright and joyous over this scene of anxiety and pain.  On came the vessel, flying before the gale, while the seas chased her as if they would fain overwhelm her.  It was fearful to see her scud--agonising to know that she was rushing to destruction.  At last he could distinguish those on board.  He waved his hand, but they perceived him not; he shouted, but his voice was borne away by the gale.  On came the vessel, as if doomed.  She was within two cables' length of the bank when those on board perceived their danger.  It was too late!--they had rounded her to--another, and another wave hurled her towards the sand.  She struck!--her only remaining mast fell over the side, and the roaring waves hastened to complete their work of destruction and of death!    CHAPTER ELEVEN.  THE ESCAPE.  Francisco's eyes were fixed upon the vessel, over which the sea now broke with terrific violence.  There appeared to be about eight or nine men on her deck, who sheltered themselves under the weather bulwarks. Each wave, as it broke against her side and then dashed in foam over her, threw her, with a convulsive jerk, still further on the sand-bank. At last she was so high up that their fury was partly spent before they dashed against her frame.  Had the vessel been strong and well built-- had she been a collier coasting the English shores--there was a fair chance that she might have withstood the fury of the storm until it had subsided, and that by remaining on board, the crew might have survived: but she was of a very different mould, and, as Francisco justly surmised, an American brig, built for swift sailing, very sharp, and, moreover, very slightly put together.  Francisco's eyes, as may easily be supposed, were never removed from the only object which could now interest him--the unexpected appearance and imminent danger of his fellow-creatures at this desolate spot.  He perceived that two of the men went to the hatches, and slid them over to leeward: they then descended, and although the seas broke over the vessel, and a large quantity of water must have poured into her, the hatches were not put on again by those who remained on deck.  But in a few minutes this mystery was solved; one after another, at first, and then by dozens, poured forth, out of the hold, the kidnapped Africans who composed her cargo.  In a short time the decks were covered with them: the poor creatures had been released by the humanity of two English sailors, that they might have the same chance with themselves of saving their lives.  Still, no attempt was made to quit the vessel. Huddled together, like a flock of sheep, with the wild waves breaking over them, there they all remained, both European and African; and as the heavy blows of the seas upon the sides of the vessel careened and shook her, they were seen to cling, in every direction, with no distinction between the captured and their oppressors.  But this scene was soon changed; the frame of the vessel could no longer withstand the violence of the waves, and as Francisco watched, of a sudden it was seen to divide a-midships, and each portion to turn over. Then was the struggle for life; hundreds were floating on the raging element, and wrestling for existence, and the white foam of the ocean was dotted by the black heads of the negroes who attempted to gain the bank.  It was an awful, terrible scene, to witness so many at one moment tossed and dashed about by the waves--so many fellow-beings threatened with eternity.  At one moment they were close to the beach, forced on to it by some tremendous wave; at the next, the receding water and the undertow swept them all back; and of the many who had been swimming one half had disappeared to rise no more.  Francisco watched with agony as he perceived that the number decreased, and that none had yet gained the shore.  At last he snatched up the haulyards of his boat's sail which were near him, and hastened down to the spot to afford such succour as might be possible; nor were his efforts in vain.  As the seas washed the apparently inanimate bodies on shore, and would then have again swept them away to return them in mockery, he caught hold of them and dragged them safe on the bank, and thus did he continue his exertions until fifteen of the bodies of the negroes were spread upon the beach. Although exhausted and senseless, they were not dead, and long before he had dragged up the last of the number, many of those previously saved had, without any other assistance than the heat of the sun, recovered from their insensibility.  Francisco would have continued his task of humanity, but the parted vessel had now been riven into fragments by the force of the waves, and the whole beach was strewed with her timbers and her stores, which were dashed on shore by the waters, and then swept back again by the return. In a short time the severe blows he received from these fragments disabled him from further exertion, and he sank exhausted on the sand; indeed, all further attempts were useless.  All on board the vessel had been launched into the sea at the same moment, and those who were not now on shore were past all succour.  Francisco walked up to those who had been saved: he found twelve of them were recovered and sitting on their hams; the rest were still in a state of insensibility.  He then went up to the knoll, where his chest and provisions had been placed, and, throwing himself down by them, surveyed the scene.  The wind had lulled, the sun shone brightly, and the sea was much less violent.  The waves had subsided, and, no longer hurried on by the force of the hurricane, broke majestically, and solemnly, but not with the wildness and force which, but a few hours before, they had displayed. The whole of the beach was strewed with the fragments of the vessel, with spars and water-casks; and at every moment was to be observed the corpse of a negro turning round and round in the froth of the wave, and then disappearing.  For an hour did he watch and reflect and then he walked again to where the men who had been rescued were sitting, not more than thirty yards from him; they were sickly, emaciated forms, but belonging to a tribe who inhabited the coast, and who having been accustomed from their infancy to be all the day in the water, had supported themselves better than the other slaves, who had been procured from the interior, or the European crew of the vessel, all of whom had perished.  The Africans appeared to recover fast by the heat of the sun, so oppressive to Francisco, and were now exchanging a few words with each other.  The whole of them had revived, but those who were most in need of aid were neglected by the others.  Francisco made signs to them, but they understood him not.  He returned to the knoll, and pouring out water into a tin pan from the breaker, brought it down to them.  He offered it to one, who seized it eagerly; water was a luxury seldom obtained in the hold of a slave-vessel.  The man drank deeply, and would have drained the cup, but Francisco prevented him, and held it to the lips of another.  He was obliged to refill it three times before they had all been supplied: he then brought them a handful of biscuit, and left them, for he reflected that, without some precautions, the whole sustenance would be seized by them and devoured.  He buried half a foot deep, and covered over with sand, the breakers of water and the provisions, and by the time he had finished this task, unperceived by the negroes, who still squatted together, the sun had sunk below the horizon.  Francisco had already matured his plans, which were, to form a raft out of the fragments of the vessel, and, with the assistance of the negroes, attempt to gain the mainland.  He lay down, for the second night, on this eventful spot of desolation, and commending himself to the Almighty protection, was soon in a deep slumber.  It was not until the powerful rays of the sun blazed on the eyes of the youth that he awoke, so tired had he been with the anxiety and fatigue of the preceding day, and the sleepless harrowing night which had introduced it.  He rose and seated himself upon his sea-chest: how different was the scene from that of yesterday!  Again the ocean slept, the sky was serene, and not a cloud to be distinguished throughout the whole firmament; the horizontal line was clear, even, and well defined: a soft breeze just rippled over the dark blue sea, which now had retired to its former boundary, and left the sand-bank as extended as when first Francisco had been put on shore.  But here the beauty of the landscape terminated: the foreground was horrible to look upon; the whole of the beach was covered with the timbers of the wreck, with water-casks, and other articles, in some parts heaped and thrown up one upon another; and among them lay, jammed and mangled, the bodies of the many who had perished.  In other parts there were corpses thrown up high and dry, or still rolling and turning to the rippling wave: it was a scene of desolation and of death.  The negroes who had been saved were all huddled up together, apparently in deep sleep, and Francisco quitted his elevated position and walked down to the low beach, to survey the means which the disaster of others afforded him for his own escape.  To his great joy he found not only plenty of casks, but many of them full of fresh water, provisions also in sufficiency, and, indeed, everything that could be required to form a raft, as well as the means of support for a considerable time for himself and the negroes who had survived.  He then walked up to them and called to them, but they answered not, nor even moved.  He pushed them, but in vain; and his heart beat quick, for he was fearful that they were dead from previous exhaustion.  He applied his foot to one of them, and it was not until he had used force, which in any other case he would have dispensed with, that the negro awoke from his state of lethargy and looked vacantly about him.  Francisco had some little knowledge of the language of the Kroumen, and he addressed the negro in that tongue.  To his great joy, he was answered in a language which, if not the same, had so great an affinity to it that communication became easy.  With the assistance of the negro, who used still less ceremony with his comrades, the remainder of them were awakened, and a palaver ensued.  Francisco soon made them understand that they were to make a raft and go back to their own country; explaining to them that if they remained there, the water and provisions would soon be exhausted, and they would all perish.  The poor creatures hardly knew whether to consider him a supernatural being or not; they talked among themselves; they remarked at his having brought them fresh water the day before; they knew that he did not belong to the vessel in which they had been wrecked, and they were puzzled.  Whatever might be their speculations, they had one good effect, which was, that they looked upon the youth as a superior and a friend, and most willingly obeyed him.  He led them up to the knoll, and, desiring them to scrape away the sand, supplied them again with fresh water and biscuit.  Perhaps the very supply, and the way in which it was given to them, excited their astonishment as much as anything.  Francisco ate with them, and, selecting from his sea-chest the few tools in his possession, desired them to follow him.  The casks were collected and rolled up; the empty ones arranged for the raft: the spars were hauled up and cleared of the rigging, which was carefully separated for lashings; the one or two sails which had been found rolled up on the spars were spread out to dry; and the provisions and articles of clothing, which might be useful, laid together on one side.  The negroes worked willingly, and showed much intelligence: before the evening closed, everything which might be available was secured, and the waves now only tossed about lifeless forms, and the small fragments of timber which could not be serviceable.  It would occupy too much time were we to detail all the proceedings of Francisco and the negroes for the space of four days, during which they laboured hard.  Necessity is truly the mother of invention, and many were the ingenious resources of the party before they could succeed in forming a raft large enough to carry them and their provisions, with a mast and sail well secured.  At length it was accomplished; and on the fifth day, Francisco and his men embarked; and, having pushed clear of the bank with poles, they were at last able to hoist their sail to a fine breeze, and steer for the coast before the wind at the rate of about three miles an hour.  But it was not until they had gained half a mile from the bank that they were no longer annoyed by the dreadful smell arising from the putrefaction of so many bodies, for to bury them all would have been a work of too great time.  The last two days of their remaining on the island, the effluvia had become so powerful as to be a source of the greatest horror and disgust even to the negroes.  But before night when the raft was about eight leagues from the sand-bank, it fell calm, and continued so for the next day, when a breeze sprang up from the south-east, to which they trimmed their sail with their head to the northward.  This wind, and the course steered, sent them off from the land, but there was no help for it; and Francisco felt grateful that they had such an ample supply of provisions and water as to enable them to yield to a few days' contrary wind without danger of want.  But the breeze continued steady and fresh, and they were now crossing the Bight of Benin; the weather was fine and the sea smooth; the flying-fish rose in shoals, and dropped down into the raft, which still forced its way through the water to the northward.  Thus did Francisco and his negro crew remain for a fortnight floating on the wide ocean, without any object meeting their view.  Day after day it was the same dreary ""sky and water,"" and by the reckoning of Francisco they could not be far from the land, when, on the fifteenth day, they perceived two sails to the northward.  Francisco's heart bounded with joy and gratitude to Heaven; he had no telescope to examine them, but he steered directly for them, and, about dark, he made them out to be a ship and a schooner, hove to.  As Francisco scanned them, surmising what they might be, the sun set behind the two vessels, and after it had sunk below the horizon their forms were, for a few minutes, delineated with remarkable precision and clearness.  There could be no mistake.  Francisco felt convinced that the schooner was the _Avenger_; and his first impulse was to run to the sweep with which they were steered, and put the head of the raft again to the northward.  A moment's reflection determined him to act otherwise; he lowered down his sail that he might escape observation, and watched the motions of the vessels during the few minutes of light which remained.  That the ship had been captured, and that her capture had been attended with the usual scene of outrage and violence, he had no doubt.  He was now about four miles from them, and just as they were vanishing from his straining eyes he perceived that the schooner had made all sail to the westward.  Francisco, feeling that he was then secure from being picked up by her, again hoisted his sail with the hope of reaching the ship, which, if not scuttled, he intended to remove on board of, and then make sail for the first port on the coast.  But hardly had the raft regained her way when the horizon was lighted up, and he perceived that the pirates had set fire to the vessel.  Then it was useless to proceed towards her; and Francisco again thought of putting the head of the raft to the northward, when the idea struck him, knowing the character and cruelty of the pirates, that there might be some unfortunate people left on board to perish in the flames.  He therefore continued his course, watching the burning vessel; the flames increased in violence, mounting up to the masts and catching the sails one after another.  The wind blew fresh, and the vessel was kept before the wind--a circumstance that assured Francisco that there were people on board.  At first she appeared to leave the raft, but as her sails, one after another, were consumed by the element, so did she decrease her speed, and Francisco, in about an hour, was close to her and under her counter.  The ship was now one mass of fire from her bows to her mainmast; a volume of flame poured from her main hold, rising higher than her lower masts, and ending in a huge mass of smoke carried by the wind ahead of her; the quarter-deck was still free from fire, but the heat on it was so intense that those on board were all collected at the taffrail; and there they remained, some violent, others in mute despair; for the _Avenger's_ people, in their barbarity, had cut away and destroyed all the boats, to prevent their escape.  From the light thrown round the vessel, those on board had perceived the approach of Francisco to their rescue, and immediately that it was under the counter, and the sail lowered, almost all of them had descended by ropes, or the stern ladder, and gained a place in her.  In a few minutes, without scarcely an exchange of a word, they were all out of the brig, and Francisco pushed off just as the flames burst from the cabin-windows, darting out in a horizontal line like the tongues of fiery serpents.  The raft, now encumbered with twelve more persons, was then steered to the northward; and as soon as those who had been saved had been supplied with some water, which they so much needed, Francisco obtained the intelligence which he desired.  The ship was from Carthagena, South America; had sailed from thence to Lisbon with a Don Cumanos, who had large property up the Magdalen river.  He had wished to visit a part of his family at Lisbon, and from thence had sailed to the Canary Isles, where he also had property.  In their way from Lisbon to South America they had been beaten by stress of weather to the southward, and afterwards had been chased by the _Avenger_; being a very fast sailer she had run down several degrees before she had been captured.  When the pirate took possession, and found that she had little or no cargo of value to them, for her hold was chiefly filled with furniture and other articles for the use of Don Cumanos, angry at their disappointment, they had first destroyed all their boats and then set fire to the vessel, taking care not to leave her until all chance of the fire being put out was hopeless.  And thus had these miscreants left innocent and unfortunate people to perish.  Francisco heard the narrative of Don Cumanos, and then informed him in what manner he had left the schooner, and his subsequent adventures. Francisco was now very anxious to make the land, or obtain succour from some vessel.  The many who were now on board, and the time that he had already been at sea, obliged him to reduce the allowance of water. Fortune favoured him after all his trials; on the third day a vessel hove in sight, and they were seen by her.  She made sail for them, and took them all on board.  It was a schooner trafficking on the coast for gold-dust and ivory; but the magnificent offers of Don Cumanos induced them to give up their voyage and run across the Atlantic to Carthagena. To Francisco it was of little moment where he went, and in Don Cumanos he had found a sincere friend.  ""You have been my preserver,"" said the Spaniard, ""allow me to return the obligation--come and live with me.""  As Francisco was equally pleased with Don Cumanos, he accepted the offer; they all arrived safely at Carthagena, and from thence proceeded to his estate on the Magdalen river.    CHAPTER TWELVE.  THE LIEUTENANT.  When we last mentioned Edward Templemore, we stated that he was a lieutenant of the admiral's ship on the West India station, commanding the tender.  Now the name of the tender was the _Enterprise_: and it was singular that she was one of two schooners built at Baltimore, remarkable for their beauty and good qualities; yet how different were their employments!  Both had originally been built for the slave-trade; now one hoisted the English pennant, and cruised as the _Enterprise_; the other threw out the black flag, and scoured the seas as the _Avenger_.  The _Enterprise_ was fitted much in the same way as we have already described her sister vessel--that is, with one long brass gun amidships, and smaller ones for her broadside.  But in the numbers of their crew there was a great disparity; the _Enterprise_ not being manned with more than sixty-five English sailors, belonging to the admiral's ship.  She was employed, as most admirals' tenders usually _were_, sometimes carrying a tender made for a supply of provisions, or a tender of services, if required, from the admiral; or, if not particularly wanted, with the important charge of a tender _billet-doux_ to some fair friend. But this is a tender subject to touch upon.  In the meantime it must be understood that she had the same commission to sink, burn, and destroy, as all other of his Majesty's vessels, if anything came in her way; but as she usually carried despatches, the real importance of which were, of course, unknown, she was not to go out of her way upon such service.  Edward Templemore did, however, occasionally go a little out of his way, and had lately captured a very fine privateer after a smart action, for which he anticipated his promotion; but the admiral thought him too young, and therefore gave the next vacancy to his own nephew, who, the admiral quite forgot, was much younger.  Edward laughed when he heard of it, upon his arrival at Port Royal; and the admiral, who expected that he would make his appearance pouting with disappointment, when he came up to the Penn to report himself, was so pleased with his good humour that he made a vow that Templemore should have the next vacancy; but this he also quite forgot, because Edward happened to be, at the time it occurred, on a long cruise,--and ""out of sight out of mind"" is a proverb so well established, that it may be urged as an excuse for a person who had so many other things to think of as the admiral entrusted with the command of the West India station.  Lieutenant Templemore had, in consequence, commanded the _Enterprise_ for nearly two years, and without grumbling; for he was of a happy disposition, and passed a very happy sort of life.  Mr Witherington was very indulgent to him, and allowed him to draw liberally; he had plenty of money for himself or for a friend who required it, and he had plenty of amusement.  Amongst other diversions, he had fallen most desperately in love; for, in one of his trips to the Leeward Isles (so called from their being to windward) he had succoured a Spanish vessel, which had on board the new Governor of Porto Rico, with his family, and had taken upon himself to land them on that island in safety; for which service the English admiral received a handsome letter, concluding with the moderate wish that his Excellency might live a thousand years, and Edward Templemore an invitation to go and see them whenever he might pass that way; which, like most general invitations, was as much a compliment as the wish which wound up the letter to the admiral.  It did, however, so happen that the Spanish governor had a very beautiful and only daughter, carefully guarded by a duenna, and a monk who was the depository of all the sins of the governor's establishment; and it was with this daughter that Edward Templemore fell into the heresy of love.  She was, indeed, very beautiful; and, like all her countrywomen, was ardent in her affection.  The few days that she was on board the schooner with her father, during the time that the _Enterprise_ convoyed the Spanish vessel into port, were quite sufficient to ignite two such inflammable beings as Clara d'Alfarez and Edward Templemore.  The monk had been left on board of the leaky vessel; there was no accommodation in the schooner for him or the duenna, and Don Felix de Maxos de Cobas de Manilla d'Alfarez was too busy with his cigar to pay attention to his daughter.  When they were landed, Edward Templemore was asked to their residence, which was not in the town, but at a lovely bay on the south side of the island.  The town mansion was appropriated to business and the ceremony of the court: it was too hot for a permanent abode, and the governor only went there for a few hours each day.  Edward Templemore remained a short time at the island, and at his departure received the afore-mentioned letter from the father to the English admiral, and an assurance of unalterable fidelity from the daughter to the English lieutenant.  On his return he presented the letter, and the admiral was satisfied with his conduct.  When ordered out to cruise, which he always was when there was nothing else to do, he submitted to the admiral whether, if he should happen to be near Porto Rico, he could not leave an answer to the Spanish governor's letter; and the admiral, who knew the value of keeping up a good understanding with foreign relations, took the hint, and gave him one to deliver, if _convenient_.  The second meeting was, as may be supposed, more cordial than the first on the part of the young lady; not so, however, on the part of the duenna and holy friar, who soon found out that their charge was in danger from heretical opinions.  Caution became necessary; and as secrecy adds a charm to an amour, Clara received a long letter and a telescope from Edward.  The letter informed her that, whenever he could, he would make his appearance in his schooner off the south of the island, and await a signal made by her at a certain window, acknowledging her recognition of his vessel.  On the night of that signal he would land in his boat and meet her at an appointed spot.  This was all very delightful; and it so happened that Edward had four or five times contrived, during the last year, to meet Clara without discovery, and again and again to exchange his vows.  It was agreed between them that when he quitted the station, she would quit her father and her home, and trust her future happiness to an Englishman and a heretic.  It may be a matter of surprise to some of our readers that the admiral should not have discovered the frequent visits of the _Enterprise_ to Porto Rico, as Edward was obliged to bring his log for examination every time that he returned; but the admiral was satisfied with Edward's conduct, and his anxiety to cruise when there was nothing else for him to do.  His logs were brought on shore to the admiral's secretary, carefully rolled and sealed up.  The admiral's secretary threw the packages on one side, and thought no more of the matter, and Edward had always a ready story to tell when he took his seat at the admiral's dinner-table; besides, he is a very unfit person to command a vessel who does not know how to write a log that will bear an investigation.  A certain latitude is always allowed in every degree of latitude as well as longitude.  The Enterprise had been despatched to Antigua, and Edward thought this an excellent opportunity to pay a visit to Clara d'Alfarez: he therefore, upon his return, hove to off the usual headland, and soon perceived the white curtain thrown out of the window.  ""There it is, sir,"" said one of the midshipmen who was near him--for he had been there so often that the whole crew of the Enterprise were aware of his attachment--""She has shown her flag of truce.""  ""A truce to your nonsense, Mr Warren,"" replied Edward, laughing; ""how came you to know anything about it?""  ""I only judge by cause and effect, sir; and I know that I shall have to go on shore and wait for you tonight.""  ""That's not unlikely; but let draw the foresheet; we must now get behind the headland.""  The youngster was right: that evening, a little before dark, he attended his commander on shore, the _Enterprise_ lying to with a lantern at her peak.  ""Once more, dearest Clara!"" said Edward, as he threw off her long veil and pressed her in his arms.  ""Yes, Edward, once more--but I am afraid only once more; for my maid, Inez, has been dangerously ill, and has confessed to Friar Ricardo.  I fear much that, in her fright (for she thought that she was dying), she has told all.  She is better now.""  ""Why should you imagine so, Clara?""  ""Oh, you know not what a frightened fool that Inez is when she is ill! Our religion is not like yours.""  ""No, dear, it is not; but I will teach you a better.""  ""Hush, Edward, you must not say that.  Holy Virgin! if Friar Ricardo should hear you!  I think that Inez must have told him, for he fixes his dark eyes upon me so earnestly.  Yesterday he observed to me that I had not confessed.""  ""Tell him to mind his own business.""  ""That is his business, and I was obliged to confess to him last night. I told him a great many things, and then he asked if that was all.  His eyes went through me.  I trembled as I uttered an untruth, for I said it was.""  ""I confess my sins but to my Maker, Clara! and I confess my love but to you.  Follow my plan, dearest!""  ""I will half obey you, Edward.  I will not tell my love.""  ""And sins you have none, Clara; so you will obey me in all.""  ""Hush, Edward, you must not say that.  We all have sins; and, oh! what a grievous sin they say it is to love you, who are a heretic!  Holy Virgin, pardon me! but I could not help it.""  ""If that is your only sin, dearest, I can safely give you absolution.""  ""Nay, Edward, don't joke, but hear me.  If Inez has confessed, they will look for me here, and we must not meet again--at least not in this place.  You know the little bay behind the rock, it is not much farther off, and there is a cave where I can wait: another time it must be there.""  ""It shall be there, dearest; but is it not too near the beach? will you not be afraid of the men in the boat, who must see you?""  ""But we can leave the beach.  It is Ricardo alone that I am in dread of, and the Donna Maria.  Merciful Heaven! should my father know all, we should be lost--be separated for ever!"" and Clara laid her forehead on Edward's shoulder, as her tears fell fast.  ""There is nought to fear, Clara.  Hush!  I heard a rustling in those orange-trees.  Listen!""  ""Yes! yes!"" whispered Clara, hastily; ""there is some one.  Away! dear Edward, away!""  Clara sprang from his side, and hastened up the grove.  Edward made his retreat, and flying down the rocky and narrow path through the underwood, was soon on the beach and into his boat.  The _Enterprise_ arrived at head quarters, and Edward reported himself to the admiral.  ""I have work for you, Mr Templemore,"" said the admiral; ""you must be ready to proceed on service immediately.  We've found your match.""  ""I hope I may find her, sir,"" replied the lieutenant.  ""I hope so, too; for, if you give a good account of her, it will put another swab on your shoulder.  The pirate schooner, which has so long infested the Atlantic, has been seen and chased off Barbadoes by the _Amelia_: but it appears that there is not a vessel in the squadron which can come near her unless it be the _Enterprise_.  She has since captured two West Indiamen, and was seen steering with them towards the coast of Guiana.  Now, I am going to give you thirty additional hands, and send you after her.""  ""Thank you, sir,"" replied Edward, his countenance beaming with delight.  ""How soon will you be ready?"" inquired the admiral.  ""To-morrow morning, sir.""  ""Very good.  Tell Mr Hadley to bring me the order for the men and your sailing orders, and I will sign them; but recollect, Mr Templemore, you will have an awkward customer.  Be prudent--brave I know you to be.""  Edward Templemore promised everything, as most people do in such cases; and before the next evening the _Enterprise_ was well in the offing, under a heavy press of sail.    CHAPTER THIRTEEN.  THE LANDING.  The property of Don Cumanos, to which he had retired with his family, accompanied by Francisco, extended from the mouth of, to many miles up, the Magdalen river.  It was a fine alluvial soil, forming one vast strip of rich meadow, covered with numerous herds of cattle.  The house was not a hundreds yards from the bank of the magnificent stream, and a small but deep creek ran up to the adjacent buildings; for Don Cumanos had property even more valuable, being proprietor of a gold mine near the town of Jambrano, about eight miles farther up, and which mine had latterly become exceedingly productive.  The ore was brought down the river in boats, and smelted in the outhouses near the creek to which we have just referred.  It will be necessary to observe that the establishment of the noble Spaniard was numerous, consisting of nearly one hundred persons, employed in the smelting-house or attached to the household.  For some time Francisco remained here happy and contented; he had become the confidential supervisor of Don Cumanos' household, proved himself worthy of a trust so important, and was considered as one of the family.  One morning, as Francisco was proceeding down to the smelting-house to open the hatches of the small deck boats which had arrived from Jambrano with ore, and which were invariably secured with a padlock by the superintendent above, to which Don Cumanos had a corresponding key, one of the chief men informed him that a vessel had anchored off the mouth of the river the day before, and weighed again early that morning, and that she was now standing off and on.  ""From Carthagena, probably, beating up,"" replied Francisco.  ""Valga me Dios, if I know that, sir,"" said Diego, ""I should have thought nothing about it; but Giacomo and Pedro, who went out to fish last night, as usual, instead of coming back before midnight, have not been heard of since.""  ""Indeed! that is strange.  Did they ever stay so long before?""  ""Never, sir; and they have fished together now for seven years.""  Francisco gave the key to the man, who opened the locks of the hatches, and returned it.  ""There she is!"" cried the man; the head-sails making their appearance as the vessel opened to their view from the projecting point distant about four miles.  Francisco directed his eye towards her, and, without further remark, hastened to the house.  ""Well, Francisco,"" said Don Cumanos, who was stirring a small cup of chocolate, ""what's the news this morning?""  ""The _Nostra Senora del Carmen_ and the _Aguilla_ have arrived, and I have just unlocked the hatches.  There is a vessel off the point which requires examination, and I have come for the telescope.""  ""Requires examination!  Why, Francisco?""  ""Because Giacomo and Pedro, who went fishing last night, have not returned, and there are no tidings of them.""  ""That is strange!  But how is this connected with the vessel?""  ""That I will explain as soon as I have had an examination of her,"" replied Francisco, who had taken up the telescope, and was drawing out the tube.  Francisco fixed the glass against the sill of the window, and examined the vessel some time in silence.  ""Yes! by the living God, it is the _Avenger_, and no other,"" exclaimed he, as he removed the telescope from his eye.  ""Eh?"" cried Don Cumanos.  ""It is the pirate vessel--the _Avenger_--I'll forfeit my life upon it! Don Cumanos, you must be prepared.  I know that they have long talked of a visit to this quarter, and anticipate great booty, and they have those on board who know the coast well.  The disappearance of your two men convinces me that they sent up their boats last night to reconnoitre, and have captured them.  Torture will extract the information which the pirates require, and I have little doubt but that the attack will be made, when they learn how much bullion there is at present on your premises.""  ""You may be right,"" replied Don Cumanos, thoughtfully; ""that is, provided you are sure that it is the pirate vessel.""  ""Sure, Don Cumanos!  I know every timber and plank in her; there is not a rope nor a block but I can recognise.  At the distance of four miles, with such a glass as this, I can discover every little variety in her rigging from other craft, I will swear to her,"" repeated Francisco, once more looking through the telescope.  ""And if they attack, Francisco?""  ""We must defend ourselves, and, I trust, beat them off.  They will come in their boats, and at night.  If they were to run in the schooner by daylight and anchor abreast of us, we should have but a poor chance. But they little think that I am here, and that they are recognised. They will attack this night, I rather think.""  ""And what do you then propose, Francisco?""  ""That we should send all the females away to Don Teodoro's--it is but five miles--and call the men together as soon as possible.  We are strong enough to beat them off if we barricade the house.  They cannot land more than from ninety to one hundred men, as some must remain in charge of the schooner; and we can muster quite as many.  It may be as well to promise our men a reward if they do their duty.""  ""That is all right enough; and the bullion we have here.""  ""Here we had better let it remain; it will take too much time to remove it, and, besides, will weaken our force by the men who must be in charge of it.  The out-houses must be abandoned, and everything which is of consequence taken from them.  Fire them they will, in all probability. At all events we have plenty of time before us, if we begin at once.""  ""Well, Francisco, I shall make you commandant, and leave the arrangements to you, while I go and speak to Donna Isidora.  Send for the men and speak to them; promise them rewards, and act as if you were ordering upon your own responsibility.""  ""I trust I shall prove myself worthy of your confidence, sir,"" replied Francisco.  ""Carambo!"" exclaimed the old don, as he left the room; ""but it is fortunate you are here.  We might all have been murdered in our beds.""  Francisco sent for the head men of the establishment, and told them what he was convinced they would have to expect; and he then explained to them his views.  The rest were all summoned; and Francisco pointed out to them the little mercy they would receive if the pirates were not repulsed, and the rewards which were promised by Don Cumanos if they did their duty.  Spaniards are individually brave; and, encouraged by Francisco, they agreed that they would defend the property to the last.  The house of Don Cumanos was well suited to resist an attack of this description, in which musketry only was expected to be employed.  It was a long parallelogram of stone walls, with a wooden veranda on the first floor,--for it was only one story high.  The windows on the first story were more numerous, but at the basement there were but two, and no other opening but the door in the whole line of building.  It was of a composite architecture, between the Morisco and the Spanish.  If the lower part of the house, which was of stone, could be secured from entrance, the assailants would, of course, fight under a great disadvantage.  The windows below were the first secured by piling a heavy mass of stones in the interior of the rooms against them, rising to the ceiling from a base like the segment of a pyramid, extending to the opposite side of the chamber; and every preparation was made for effectually barricading the door before night.  Ladders were then fixed to ascend to the veranda, which was rendered musket-proof nearly as high as its railings, to protect the men.  The Donna Isidora, and the women of the establishment, were, in the afternoon, despatched to Don Teodoro's; and, at the request of Francisco, joined to the entreaties of Donna Isidora, Don Cumanos was persuaded to accompany them.  The don called his men, and telling them that he left Francisco in command, expected them to do their duty; and then shaking hands with him, the cavalcade was soon lost in the woods behind the narrow meadows which skirted the river.  There was no want of muskets and ammunition.  Some were employed casting bullets, and others in examining the arms which had long been laid by. Before evening all was ready; every man had received his arms and ammunition; the flints had been inspected; and Francisco had time to pay more attention to the schooner, which had, during the day, increased her distance from the land, but was now again standing in for the shore. Half-an-hour before dusk, when within three miles, she wore round and put her head to the offing.  ""They'll attack this night,"" said Francisco, ""I feel almost positive: their yards and stay-tackles are up, all ready for hoisting out the long-boat.""  ""Let them come, senor; we will give them a warm reception,"" replied Diego, the second in authority.  It was soon too dark to perceive the vessel.  Francisco and Diego ordered every man, but five, into the house; the door was firmly barricaded, and some large pieces of rock, which had been rolled into the passage, piled against it.  Francisco then posted the five men down the banks of the river, at a hundred yards' distance from each other, to give notice of the approach of the boats.  It was about ten o'clock at night, when Francisco and Diego descended the ladder and went to examine their outposts.  ""Senor,"" said Diego, as he and Francisco stood on the bank of the river, ""at what hour is it your idea that these villains will make their attempt?""  ""That is difficult to say.  If the same captain commands them who did when I was on board of her, it will not be until after the moon is down, which will not be till midnight; but should it be any other who is in authority, they may not be so prudent.""  ""Holy Virgin! senor, were you ever on board of that vessel?""  ""Yes, Diego, I was, and for a long while, too; but not with my own good will.  Had I not been on board I never should have recognised her.""  ""Very true, senor; then we may thank the saints that you have once been a pirate.""  ""I hope that I never was that, Diego,"" replied Francisco, smiling; ""but I have been a witness to dreadful proceedings on board of that vessel, at the remembrance of which, even now, my blood curdles.""  To pass away the time, Francisco then detailed many scenes of horror to Diego which he had witnessed when on board of the _Avenger_; and he was still in the middle of a narrative when a musket was discharged by the farthermost sentinel.  ""Hark, Diego!""  Another, and another, nearer and nearer to them, gave the signal that the boats were close at hand.  In a few minutes the men all came in, announcing that the pirates were pulling up the stream in three boats, and were less than a quarter of a mile from the landing-place.  ""Diego, go to the house with these men, and see that all is ready,"" said Francisco.  ""I will wait here a little longer; but do not fire till I come to you.""  Diego and the men departed, and Francisco was left on the beach alone.  In another minute, the sound of the oars was plainly distinguishable, and Francisco's ears were directed to catch, if possible, the voices. ""Yes,"" thought he, ""you come with the intentions of murder and robbery; but you will, through me, be disappointed.""  As the boats approached, he heard the voice of Hawkhurst.  The signal muskets fired had told the pirates that they were discovered, and that, in all probability, they would meet with resistance; silence was, therefore, no longer of any advantage.  ""Oars, my lads!--oars!"" cried Hawkhurst.  One boat ceased rowing, and soon afterwards the two others.  The whole of them were now plainly seen by Francisco, at the distance of about one cable's length from where he stood; and the clear still night carried the sound of their voices along the water.  ""Here is a creek, sir,"" said Hawkhurst, ""leading up to those buildings. Would it not be better to land there, as, if they are not occupied, they will prove a protection to us if we have a hard fight for it?""  ""Very true, Hawkhurst,"" replied a voice, which Francisco immediately recognised to be that of Cain.  ""He is alive, then,"" thought Francisco, ""and his blood is not yet upon my hands.""  ""Give way, my lads!"" cried Hawkhurst.  The boats dashed up the creek, and Francisco hastened back to the house.  ""Now, my lads,"" said he, as he sprang up the ladder, ""you must be resolute; we have to deal with desperate men.  I have heard the voices of the captain and the chief mate; so there is no doubt as to its being the pirate.  The boats are up the creek and will land behind the out-buildings.  Haul up these ladders, and lay them fore and aft on the veranda; and do not fire without taking a good aim.  Silence! my men-- silence!  Here they come.""  The pirates were now seen advancing from the out-buildings in strong force.  In the direction in which they came, it was only from the side of the veranda, at which not more than eight or ten men could be placed, that the enemy could be repulsed.  Francisco therefore gave orders that as soon as some of the men had fired they should retreat and load their muskets, to make room for others.  When the pirates had advanced halfway to the house, on the clear space between it and the outbuildings, Francisco gave the word to fire.  The volley was answered by another, and a shout from the pirates, who, with Hawkhurst and Cain at their head, now pressed on, but not until they had received a second discharge from the Spaniards, and the pirates had fired in return.  As the Spaniards could not at first fire a volley of more than a dozen muskets at a time, their opponents imagined their force to be much less than it really was.  They now made other arrangements.  They spread themselves in a semicircle in front of the veranda, and kept up a continued galling fire.  This was returned by the party under Francisco for nearly a quarter of an hour; and as all the muskets were now called into action, the pirates found out that they had a more formidable enemy to cope with than they had anticipated.  It was now quite dark, and not a figure was to be distinguished, except by the momentary flashing of the fire-arms.  Cain and Hawkhurst, leaving their men to continue the attack, had gained the house, and a position under the veranda.  Examining the windows and door, there appeared but little chance of forcing an entrance; but it immediately occurred to them that under the veranda their men would not be exposed, and that they might fire through the wooden floor of it upon those above. Hawkhurst hastened away, and returned with about half the men, leaving the others to continue their attack as before.  The advantage of this manoeuvre was soon evident.  The musket-balls of the pirates pierced the planks, and wounded many of the Spaniards severely; and Francisco was at last obliged to order his men to retreat into the house, and fire out of the windows.  But even this warfare did not continue; for the supporting-pillars of the veranda being of wood, and very dry, they were set fire to by the pirates.  Gradually the flames wound round them, and their forked tongues licked the balustrade.  At last, the whole of the veranda was in flames.  This was a great advantage to the attacking party, who could now distinguish the Spaniards without their being so clearly seen themselves.  Many were killed and wounded.  The smoke and heat became so intense in the upper story that the men could no longer remain there; and, by the advice of Francisco, they retreated to the basement of the house.  ""What shall we do now, senor?"" said Diego, with a grave face.  ""Do?"" replied Francisco; ""they have burnt the veranda, that is all.  The house will not take fire; it is of solid stone: the roof indeed may; but still here we are.  I do not see that they are more advanced than they were before.  As soon as the veranda has burnt down, we must return above, and commence firing again from the windows.""  ""Hark, sir! they are trying the door.""  ""They may try a long while; they should have tried the door while the veranda protected them from our sight.  As soon as it is burnt, we shall be able to drive them away from it.  I will go up again and see how things are.""  ""No, senor; it is of no use.  Why expose yourself now that the flames are so bright?""  ""I must go and see if that is the case, Diego.  Put all the wounded men in the north chamber, it will be the safest, and more out of the way.""  Francisco ascended the stone staircase, and gained the upper story.  The rooms were filled with smoke, and he could distinguish nothing.  An occasional bullet whistled past him.  He walked towards the windows, and sheltered himself behind the wall between them.  The flames were not so violent, and the heat more bearable.  In a short time, a crash, and then another told him that the veranda had fallen in. He looked through the window.  The mass of lighted embers had fallen down in front of the house, and had, for a time, driven away the assailants.  Nothing was left of the veranda but the burning ends of the joists fixed in the wall above the windows, and the still glowing remains of the posts which once supported it.  But the smoke from below now cleared away, and the discharge of one or two muskets told Francisco that he was perceived by the enemy.  ""The roof is safe,"" thought he, as he withdrew from the window; ""and now I do not know whether the loss of the veranda may not prove a gain to us.""  What were the intentions of the pirates it was difficult to ascertain. For a time they had left off firing, and Francisco returned to his comrades.  The smoke had gradually cleared away, and they were able to resume their position above; but as the pirates did not fire, they, of course, could do nothing, as it was only by the flashing of the muskets that the enemy was to be distinguished.  No further attempts were made at the door or windows below; and Francisco in vain puzzled himself as to the intended plans of the assailants.  Nearly half an hour of suspense passed away.  Some of the Spaniards were of opinion that they had retreated to their boats and gone away, but Francisco knew them better.  All he could do was to remain above, and occasionally look out to discover their motions.  Diego, and one or two more, remained with him; the other men were kept below, that they might be out of danger.  ""Holy Francis! but this has been a dreadful night, senor!  How many hours until daylight?"" said Diego.  ""Two hours at least, I should think,"" replied Francisco; ""but the affair will be decided before that.""  ""The saints protect us!  See, senor, are they not coming?""  Francisco looked through the gloom, in the direction of the outbuildings, and perceived a group of men advancing.  A few moments and he could clearly make them out.  ""Yes, truly, Diego; and they have made ladders, which they are carrying. They intend to storm the windows.  Call them up; and now we must fight hard indeed.""  The Spaniards hastened up and filled the room above, which had three windows in the front, looking towards the river, and which had been sheltered by the veranda.  ""Shall we fire now, senor?""  ""No--no: do not fire till your muzzles are at their hearts.  They cannot mount more than two at a time at each window.  Recollect, my lads, that you must now fight hard, for your lives will not be spared; they will show no quarter and no mercy.""  The ends of the rude ladders now made their appearance above the sill of each window.  They had been hastily, yet firmly, constructed; and were nearly as wide as the windows.  A loud cheer was followed by a simultaneous mounting of the ladders.  Francisco was at the centre window, when Hawkhurst made his appearance, sabre in hand.  He struck aside the musket aimed at him, and the ball whizzed harmless over the broad water of the river.  Another step, and he would have been in, when Francisco fired his pistol; the ball entered the left shoulder of Hawkhurst, and he dropped his hold.  Before he could regain it, a Spaniard charged at him with a musket, and threw him back.  He fell, bearing down with him one or two of his comrades, who had been following him up the ladder.  Francisco felt as if the attack at that window was of little consequence after the fall of Hawkhurst, whose voice he had recognised; and he hastened to the one on the left, as he had heard Cain encouraging his men in that direction.  He was not wrong in his conjecture; Cain was at the window, attempting to force an entrance, but was opposed by Diego and other resolute men.  But the belt of the pirate-captain was full of pistols, and he had already fired three with effect.  Diego and the two best men were wounded, and the others who opposed him were alarmed at his giant proportions.  Francisco rushed to attack him; but what was the force of so young a man against the Herculean power of Cain!  Still Francisco's left hand was at the throat of the pirate, and the pistol was pointed in his right, when a flash of another pistol, fired by one who followed Cain, threw its momentary vivid light upon the features of Francisco, as he cried out, ""Blood for blood!""  It was enough; the pirate captain uttered a yell of terror at the supposed supernatural appearance; and he fell from the ladder in a fit among the still burning embers of the veranda.  The fall of their two chiefs, and the determined resistance of the Spaniards, checked the impetuosity of the assailants.  They hesitated; and they at last retreated, bearing away with them their wounded.  The Spaniards cheered, and, led by Francisco, followed them down the ladders, and, in their turn, became the assailants.  Still the pirates' retreat was orderly: they fired, and retired rank behind rank successively.  They kept the Spaniards at bay, until they had arrived at the boats; when a charge was made, and a severe conflict ensued.  But the pirates had lost too many men, and, without their commander, felt dispirited.  Hawkhurst was still on his legs and giving his orders as coolly as ever.  He espied Francisco, and rushing at him, while the two parties were opposed muzzle to muzzle, seized him by his collar and dragged him in amongst the pirates.  ""Secure him at all events!"" cried Hawkhurst, as they slowly retreated and gained the out-houses. Francisco was overpowered and hauled into one of the boats, all of which in a few minutes afterwards were pulling with all their might to escape from the muskets of the Spaniards, who followed the pirates by the banks of the river, annoying them in their retreat.    CHAPTER FOURTEEN.  THE MEETING.  The pirates returned to their vessel discomfited.  Those on board, who were prepared to hoist in ingots of precious metal, had to receive nought but wounded men, and many of their comrades had remained dead on the shore.  Their captain was melancholy and downcast.  Hawkhurst was badly wounded, and obliged to be carried below as soon as he came on board.  The only capture which they had made was their former associate Francisco, who, by the last words spoken by Hawkhurst as he was supported to his cabin was ordered to be put in irons.  The boats were hoisted in without noise, and a general gloom prevailed.  All sail was then made upon the schooner, and when day dawned she was seen by the Spaniards far away to the northward.  The report was soon spread through the schooner that Francisco had been the cause of their defeat; and this was only a surmise, still, as they considered that had he not recognised the vessel the Spaniards would not have been prepared, they had good grounds for what had swelled into an assertion.  He became, therefore, to many of them, an object of bitter enmity, and they looked forward with pleasure to his destruction, which his present confinement they considered but the precursor of.  ""Hist!  Massa Francisco!"" said a low voice near to where Francisco sat on the chest.  Francisco turned round and beheld the Krouman, his old friend.  ""Ah!  Pompey, are you all still on board?"" said Francisco.  ""All! no,"" replied the man, shaking his head; ""some die--some get away-- only four Kroumen left.  Massa Francisco, how you come back again? Everybody tink you dead.  I say no, not dead--ab charm with him--ab book.""  ""If that was my charm, I have it still,"" replied Francisco, taking the Bible out of his vest; for, strange to say, Francisco himself had a kind of superstition relative to that Bible, and had put it into his bosom previous to the attack made by the pirates.  ""Dat very good, Massa Francisco; den you quite safe.  Here come Johnson--he very bad man.  I go away.""  In the meantime Cain had retired to his cabin with feelings scarcely to be analysed.  He was in a bewilderment.  Notwithstanding the wound he had received by the hand of Francisco, he would never have sanctioned Hawkhurst putting him on shore on a spot which promised nothing but a lingering and miserable death.  Irritated as he had been by the young man's open defiance, he loved him--loved him much more than he was aware of himself; and when he had recovered sufficiently from his wound, and had been informed where Francisco had been sent on shore, he quarrelled with Hawkhurst, and reproached him bitterly and sternly, in language which Hawkhurst never forgot or forgave.  The vision of the starving lad haunted Cain, and rendered him miserable.  His affection for him, now that he was, as he supposed, lost for ever, increased with tenfold force; and since that period Cain had never been seen to smile.  He became more gloomy, more ferocious than ever, and the men trembled when he appeared on deck.  The apparition of Francisco after so long an interval, and in such an unexpected quarter of the globe, acted, as we have before described, upon Cain.  When he was taken to the boat he was still confused in his ideas, and it was not until they were nearly on board that he perceived that this young man was indeed at his side.  He could have fallen on his neck and kissed him: for Francisco had become to him a capture more prized than all the wealth of the Indies.  But one pure, good feeling was unextinguished in the bosom of Cain; stained with every crime--with his hands so deeply imbrued in blood--at enmity with all the rest of the world, that one feeling burnt bright and clear, and was not to be quenched.  It might have proved a beacon-light to steer him back to repentance and to good works.  But there were other feelings which also crowded upon the mind of the pirate-captain.  He knew Francisco's firmness and decision.  By some inscrutable means, which Cain considered as supernatural, Francisco had obtained the knowledge, and had accused him, of his mother's death. Would not the affection which he felt for the young man be met with hatred and defiance?  He was but too sure that it would.  And then his gloomy, cruel disposition would reassume its influence, and he thought of revenging the attack upon his life.  His astonishment at the reappearance of Francisco was equally great, and he trembled at the sight of him, as if he were his accusing and condemning spirit.  Thus did he wander from one fearful fancy to another, until he at last summoned up resolution to send for him.  A morose, dark man, whom Francisco had not seen when he was before in the schooner, obeyed the commands of the captain.  The irons were unlocked, and Francisco was brought down into the cabin.  The captain rose and shut the door.  ""I little thought to see you here, Francisco,"" said Cain.  ""Probably not,"" replied Francisco, boldly, ""but you have me again, in your power, and may now wreak your vengeance.""  ""I feel none, Francisco; nor would I have suffered you to have been put on shore as you were, had I known of it.  Even now that our expedition has failed through your means, I feel no anger towards you, although I shall have some difficulty in preserving you from the enmity of others. Indeed, Francisco, I am glad to find that you are alive, and I have bitterly mourned your loss:"" and Cain extended his hand.  But Francisco folded his arms, and was silent.  ""Are you then so unforgiving?"" said the captain.  ""You know that I tell the truth.""  ""I believe that you state the truth, Captain Cain, for you are too bold to lie; and, as far as I am concerned, you have all the forgiveness you may wish; but I cannot take that hand; nor are our accounts yet settled.""  ""What would you more?  Cannot we be friends again?  I do not ask you to remain on board.  You are free to go where you please.  Come, Francisco, take my hand, and let us forget what is past.""  ""The hand that is imbrued with my mother's blood, perhaps!"" exclaimed Francisco.  ""Never!""  ""Not so, by God!"" exclaimed Cain.  ""No, no; not quite so bad as that. In my mood I struck your mother; I grant it.  I did not intend to injure her, but I did, and she died.  I will not lie--that is the fact.  And it is also the fact that I wept over her, Francisco; for I loved her as I do you.  ""It was a hasty, bitter blow, that,"" continued Cain, soliloquising, with his hand to his forehead, and unconscious of Francisco's presence at the moment.  ""It made me what I am, for it made me reckless.""  ""Francisco,"" said Cain, raising his head, ""I was bad, but I was no pirate when your mother lived.  There is a curse upon me: that which I love most I treat the worst.  Of all the world, I loved your mother most: yet did she from me receive much injury, and at last I caused her death.  Next to your mother, whose memory I at once revere and love, and tremble when I think of (and each night does she appear to me), I have loved you, Francisco; for you, like her, have an angel's feelings: yet have I treated you as ill.  You thwarted me, and you were right.  Had you been wrong, I had not cared; but you were right, and it maddened me. Your appeals by day--your mother's in my dreams--""  Francisco's heart was softened; if not repentance, there was at least contrition.  ""Indeed I pity you,"" replied Francisco.  ""You must do more, Francisco; you must be friends with me,"" said Cain, again extending his hand.  ""I cannot take that hand, it is too deeply dyed in blood,"" replied Francisco.  ""Well, well, so would have said your mother.  But hear me, Francisco,"" said Cain, lowering his voice to a whisper, lest he should be overheard; ""I am tired of this life--perhaps sorry for what I have done--I wish to leave it--have wealth in plenty concealed where others know not.  Tell me, Francisco, shall we both quit this vessel, and live together happily and without doing wrong?  You shall share all, Francisco.  Say, now, does that please you?""  ""Yes; it pleases me to hear that you will abandon your lawless life, Captain Cain; but share your wealth I cannot, for how has it been gained?""  ""It cannot be returned, Francisco; I will do good with it.  I will indeed, Francisco.  I--will--repent;"" and again the hand was extended.  Francisco hesitated.  ""I do, so help me God!  I _do_ repent, Francisco!"" exclaimed the pirate-captain.  ""And I, as a Christian, do forgive you all,"" replied Francisco, taking the still extended hand.  ""May God forgive you, too!""  ""Amen!"" replied the pirate, solemnly, covering his face up in his hands.  In this position he remained some minutes, Francisco watching him in silence.  At last the face was uncovered, and, to the surprise of Francisco, a tear was on the cheek of Cain and his eyes suffused with moisture.  Francisco no longer waited for the hand to be extended; he walked up to the captain, and taking him by the hand, pressed it warmly.  ""God bless you, boy!  God bless you!"" said Cain; ""but leave me now.""  Francisco returned on deck with a light and grateful heart.  His countenance at once told those who were near him that he was not condemned, and many who dared not before take notice of him, now saluted him.  The man who had taken him out of irons looked round; he was a creature of Hawkhurst, and he knew not how to act.  Francisco observed him, and, with a wave of the hand, ordered him below.  That Francisco was again in authority was instantly perceived, and the first proof of it was, that the new second mate reported to him that there was a sail on the weather bow.  Francisco took the glass to examine her.  It was a large schooner under all sail.  Not wishing that any one should enter the cabin but himself, he went down to the cabin-door, and knocked before he entered, and reported the vessel.  ""Thank you, Francisco; you must take Hawkhurst's duty for the present-- it shall not be for long; and fear not that I shall make another capture.  I swear to you I will not, Francisco.  But this schooner--I know very well what she is: she has been looking after us some time: and a week ago, Francisco, I was anxious to meet her, that I might shed more blood.  Now I will do all I can to avoid her, and escape.  I can do no more, Francisco.  I must not be taken.""  ""There I cannot blame you.  To avoid her will be easy, I should think; the _Avenger_ outsails everything.""  ""Except, I believe, the _Enterprise_, which is a sister-vessel.  By heaven! it's a fair match,"" continued Cain, his feelings of combativeness returning for a moment; ""and it will look like a craven to refuse the fight: but fear not, Francisco--I have promised you, and I shall keep my word.""  Cain went on deck, and surveyed the vessel through the glass.  ""Yes, it must be her,"" said he aloud, so as to be heard by the pirates; ""she has been sent out by the admiral on purpose, full of his best men. What a pity we are short-handed!""  ""There's enough of us, sir,"" observed the boatswain.  ""Yes,"" replied Cain, ""if there was anything but hard blows to be got; but that is all, and I cannot spare more men.  Ready about!"" continued he, walking aft.  The _Enterprise_, for she was the vessel in pursuit, was then about five miles distant, steering for the _Avenger_, who was on a wind.  As soon as the _Avenger_ tacked, the _Enterprise_ took in her topmast studding-sail, and hauled her wind.  This brought the _Enterprise_ well on the weather-quarter of the _Avenger_, who now made all sail.  The pirates, who had had quite enough of fighting, and were not stimulated by the presence of Hawkhurst, or the wishes of their captain, now showed as much anxiety to avoid, as they usually did to seek, a combat.  At the first trial of sailing between the two schooners there was no perceptible difference; for half an hour they both continued on a wind, and when Edward Templemore examined his sextant a second time, he could not perceive that he had gained upon the _Avenger_ one cable's length.  ""We will keep away half a point,"" said Edward to his second in command. ""We can afford that, and still hold the weather-gage.""  The _Enterprise_ was kept away, and increased her speed: they neared the _Avenger_ more than a quarter of a mile.  ""They are nearing us,"" observed Francisco; ""we must keep away a point.""  Away went the _Avenger_, and would have recovered her distance, but the _Enterprise_ was again steered more off the wind.  Thus did they continue altering their course until the studding-sails below and aloft were set by both, and the position of the schooners was changed; the _Enterprise_ now being on the starboard instead of the larboard quarter of the _Avenger_.  The relative distance between the two schooners was, however, nearly the same, that is, about three miles and a half from each other; and there was every prospect of a long and weary chase on the part of the _Enterprise_, who again kept away a point to near the _Avenger_.  Both vessels were now running to the eastward.  It was about an hour before dark that another sail hove in sight right a-head of the _Avenger_, and was clearly made out to be a frigate.  The pirates were alarmed at this unfortunate circumstance, as there was little doubt but that she would prove a British cruiser; and, if not, they had equally reason to expect that she would assist in their capture.  She had evidently perceived the two schooners, and had made all sail, tacking every quarter of an hour so as to keep her relative position.  The _Enterprise_, who had also made out the frigate, to attract her attention, although not within range of the _Avenger_, commenced firing with her long-gun.  ""This is rather awkward,"" observed Cain.  ""It will be dark in less than an hour,"" observed Francisco; ""and that is our only chance.""  Cain reflected a minute.  ""Get the long-gun ready, my lads!  We will return her fire, Francisco, and hoist American colours; that will puzzle the frigate at all events, and the night may do the rest.""  The long-gun of the _Avenger_ was ready.  ""I would not fire the long-gun,"" observed Francisco, ""it will show our force, and will give no reason for our attempt to escape.  Now, if we were to fire our broadside-guns, the difference of report between them and the one of large calibre fired by the other schooner would induce them to think that we are an American vessel.""  ""Very true,"" replied Cain, ""and, as America is at peace with all the world, that our antagonist is a pirate.  Hold fast the long-gun, there; and unship the starboard ports.  See that the ensign blows out clear.""  The _Avenger_ commenced firing an occasional gun from her broadside, the reports of which were hardly to be heard by those on board of the frigate; while the long-gun of the _Enterprise_ reverberated along the water, and its loud resonance was swept by the wind to the frigate to leeward.  Such was the state of affairs when the sun sank down in the wave, and darkness obscured the vessels from each other's sight, except with the assistance of the night telescopes.  ""What do you propose to do, Captain Cain?"" said Francisco.  ""I have made up my mind to do a bold thing.  I will run down to the frigate, as if for shelter; tell him that the other vessel is a pirate, and claim his protection.  Leave me to escape afterwards; the moon will not rise till nearly one o'clock.""  ""That will be a bold _ruse_, indeed; but suppose you are once under her broadside, and she suspects you?""  ""Then I will show her my heels.  I should care nothing for her and her broadside if the schooner was not here.""  In an hour after dark the _Avenger_ was close to the frigate, having steered directly for her.  She shortened sail gradually, as if she had few hands on board; and, keeping his men out of sight, Cain ran under the stern of the frigate.  ""Schooner ahoy!  What schooner is that?""  ""_Eliza of Baltimore_, from Carthagena,"" replied Cain, rounding to under the lee of the man-of-war, and then continuing: ""That vessel in chase is a pirate.  Shall I send a boat on board?""  ""No; keep company with us.""  ""Ay, ay, sir,"" replied Cain.  ""Hands about ship!"" now resounded with the boatswain's whistle on board of the frigate, and in a minute they were on the other tack.  The _Avenger_ also tacked and kept close under the frigate's counter.  In the meantime, Edward Templemore and those on board of the _Enterprise_ who, by the course steered, had gradually neared them, perceiving the motions of the two other vessels, were quite puzzled.  At one time they thought they had made a mistake, and that it was not the pirate vessel; at another they surmised that the crew had mutinied and surrendered to the frigate.  Edward hauled his wind, and steered directly for them, to ascertain what the real facts were.  The captain of the frigate, who had never lost sight of either vessel, was equally astonished at the boldness of the supposed pirate.  ""Surely the rascal does not intend to board us?"" said he to the first-lieutenant.  ""There is no saying, sir; you know what a character he has: and some say there are three hundred men on board, which is equal to our ship's company.  Or perhaps, sir, he will pass to windward of us, and give us a broadside, and be off in the wind's eye again.""  ""At all events we will have a broadside ready for him,"" replied the captain.  ""Clear away the starboard guns, and take out the tompions. Pipe starboard watch to quarters.""  The _Enterprise_ closed with the frigate to windward, intending to run round her stern and bring to on the same tack.  ""He does not shorten sail yet, sir,"" said the first-lieutenant, as the schooner appeared skimming along about a cable's length on their weather bow.  ""And she is full of men, sir,"" said the master, looking at her through the night-glass.  ""Fire a gun at her!"" said the captain.  Bang!  The smoke cleared away, and the schooner's foretopsail, which she was in the act of clewing up, lay over side.  The shot had struck the foremast of the _Enterprise_, and cut it in two below the catharpings. The _Enterprise_ was, for the time, completely disabled.  ""Schooner ahoy!  What schooner is that?""  ""His Majesty's schooner _Enterprise_.""  ""Send a boat on board immediately.""  ""Ay, ay, sir.""  ""Turn the hands up?  Shorten sail!""  The top-gallant and courses of the frigate were taken in, and the mainsail hove to the mast.  ""Signalman, whereabouts is that other schooner now?""  ""The schooner, sir?  On the quarter,"" replied the signalman, who with everybody else on board, was so anxious about the _Enterprise_, that they had neglected to watch the motions of the supposed American.  The man had replied at random, and he now jumped upon the signal-chests abaft to look for her.  But she was not to be seen.  Cain, who had watched all that passed between the other two vessels, and had been prepared to slip off at a moment's warning, as soon as the gun was fired at the other schooner, had wore round and made all sail on a wind.  The night-glass discovered her half a mile astern; and the _ruse_ was immediately perceived.  The frigate filled and made sail, leaving Edward to return on board--for there was no time to stop for the boat--tacked, and gave chase.  But the _Avenger_ was soon in the wind's-eye of her; and at daylight was no longer to be seen.  In the meantime, Edward Templemore had followed the frigate as soon as he could set sail on his vessel, indignant at his treatment, and vowing that he would demand a court-martial.  About noon the frigate rejoined him, when matters were fully explained.  Annoyed as they all felt at not having captured the pirate, it was unanimously agreed, that by his audacity and coolness he deserved to escape.  It was found that the mast of the _Enterprise_ could be fished and scarfed, so as to enable her to continue her cruise.  The carpenters of the frigate were sent on board; and in two days the injury was repaired, and Edward Templemore once more went in pursuit of the _Avenger_.    CHAPTER FIFTEEN.  THE MISTAKE.  The _Avenger_ stood under a press of sail to the northward.  She had left her pursuers far behind; and there was not a speck on the horizon, when, on the second morning, Francisco, who had resumed his berth in the captain's cabin, went up on deck.  Notwithstanding the request of Cain, Francisco refused to take any part in the command of the schooner, considering himself as a passenger, or prisoner on parole.  He had not been on deck but a few minutes, when he observed the two Spanish fishermen belonging to the establishment of Don Cumanos conversing together forward.  Their capture had quite escaped his memory, and he went forward to speak to them.  Their surprise at seeing him was great, until Francisco informed them of what had passed.  They then recounted what had occurred to them, and showed their thumbs, which had been put into screws to torture from them the truth.  Francisco shuddered, but consoled them by promising that they should soon be at liberty, and return to their former master.  As Francisco returned from forward, he found Hawkhurst on the deck. Their eyes met and flashed in enmity.  Hawkhurst was pale from loss of blood, and evidently suffering; but he had been informed of the apparent reconciliation between Francisco and the captain, and he could no longer remain in his bed.  He knew, also, how the captain had avoided the combat with the _Enterprise_; and something told him that there was a revolution of feeling in more than one point.  Suffering as he was, he resolved to be a spectator of what passed, and to watch narrowly.  For both Francisco and Cain he had imbibed a deadly hatred, and was watching for an opportunity to wreak his revenge.  At present they were too powerful; but he felt that the time was coming when he might be triumphant.  Francisco passed Hawkhurst without speaking.  ""You are at liberty again, I see,"" observed Hawkhurst with a sneer.  ""I am not, at all events, indebted to you for it,"" replied Francisco, haughtily; ""nor for my life either.""  ""No, indeed; but I believe that I am indebted to you for this bullet in my shoulder,"" replied the mate.  ""You are,"" replied Francisco, coolly.  ""And depend upon it the debt shall be repaid with usury.""  ""I have no doubt of it, if ever it is in your power; but I fear you not.""  As Francisco made this reply, the captain came up the ladder.  Hawkhurst turned away and walked forward.  ""There is mischief in that man, Francisco,"" said the captain in an under-tone; ""I hardly know whom to trust; but he must be watched.  He is tampering with the men, and has been for some time; not that it is of much consequence, if he does but remain quiet for a little while.  The command of this vessel he is welcome to very soon; but if he attempts too early--""  ""I have those I can trust to,"" replied Francisco.  ""Let us go below.""  Francisco sent for Pompey the Krouman, and gave him his directions in the presence of the captain.  That night, to the surprise of all, Hawkhurst kept his watch; and notwithstanding the fatigue, appeared every day to be rapidly recovering from his wound.  Nothing occurred for several days, during which the _Avenger_ still continued her course.  What the captain's intentions were did not transpire; they were known only to Francisco.  ""We are very short of water, sir,"" reported Hawkhurst one morning: ""shall we have enough to last us to where we are going?""  ""How many days of full allowance have we on board?""  ""Not above twelve at the most.""  ""Then we must go on half allowance,"" replied Cain.  ""The ship's company wish to know where we are going, sir.""  ""Have they deputed you to ask the question?""  ""Not exactly, sir; but I wish to know myself,"" replied Hawkhurst, with an insolent air.  ""Turn the hands up,"" replied Cain: ""as one of the ship's company under my orders, you will, with the others, receive the information you require.""  The crew of the pirate collected aft.  ""My lads,"" said Cain, ""I understand, from the first mate, that you are anxious to know where you are going?  In reply, I acquaint you, that having so many wounded men on board, and so much plunder in the hold, I intend to repair to our rendezvous when we were formerly in this part of the world--the _Caicos_.  Is there any other question you may wish to ask of me?""  ""Yes,"" replied Hawkhurst; ""we wish to know what your intentions are relative to that young man Francisco.  We have lost immense wealth; we have now thirty men wounded in the hammocks, and nine we left dead on the shore; and I have a bullet through my body, all of which has been occasioned by him.  We demand justice!""  Here Hawkhurst was supported by several of the pirates; and there were many voices which repeated the cry of ""Justice!""  ""My men! you demand justice, and you shall have it,"" replied Cain. ""This lad you all know well; I have brought him up from a child.  He has always disliked our mode of life, and has often requested to leave it, but has been refused.  He challenged me by our own laws, `Blood for blood!'  He wounded me; but he was right in his challenge, and, therefore, I bear no malice.  Had I been aware that he was to have been sent on shore to die with hunger, I would not have permitted it.  What crime had he committed?  None; or, if any, it was against me.  He was then sentenced to death for no crime, and you yourselves exclaimed against it.  Is it not true?""  ""Yes--yes,"" replied the majority of the pirates.  ""By a miracle he escapes, and is put in charge of another man's property.  He is made a prisoner, and now you demand justice.  You shall have it.  Allowing that his life is forfeit for this offence,--you have already sentenced him, and left him to death unjustly, and therefore are bound in justice to give his life in this instance.  I ask it, my men, not only as his right, but as a favour to your captain.""  ""Agreed; it's all fair!"" exclaimed the majority of the pirate's crew.  ""My men, I thank you,"" replied Cain; ""and in return, as soon as we arrive at the Caicos, my share of the plunder on board shall be divided among you.""  This last observation completely turned the tables in favour of the captain; and those who had joined Hawkhurst now sided with the captain. Hawkhurst looked like a demon.  ""Let those who choose to be bought off, take your money,"" replied he; ""but _I will not_.  Blood for blood I will have; and so I give you warning.  That lad's life is mine, and have it I will!  Prevent me, if you can!"" continued the mate, holding up his clenched hand, and shaking it almost in the pirate-captain's face.  The blood mantled even to the forehead of Cain.  One moment he raised himself to his utmost height, then seizing a hand spike, which lay near, he felled Hawkhurst to the deck.  ""Take that for your mutiny!"" exclaimed Cain, putting his foot on Hawkhurst's neck.  ""My lads, I appeal to you.  Is this man worthy to be in command as mate?  Is he to live?""  ""No! no!"" cried the pirates.  ""Death!""  Francisco stepped forward.  ""My men, you have granted your captain one favour; grant me another, which is the life of this man.  Recollect how often he has led you to conquest, and how brave and faithful he has been until now!  Recollect that he is suffering under his wound, which has made him irritable.  Command you he cannot any longer, as he will never have the confidence of your captain; but let him live, and quit the vessel.""  ""Be it so, if you agree,"" replied Cain, looking at the men; ""I do not seek his life.""  The pirates consented.  Hawkhurst rose slowly from the deck, and was assisted below to his cabin.  The second mate was then appointed as the first, and the choice of the man to fill up the vacancy was left to the pirate-crew.  For three days after this scene all was quiet and orderly on board of the pirate.  Cain, now that he had more fully made up his mind how to act, imparted to Francisco his plans; and his giving up to the men his share of the booty still on board was, to Francisco, an earnest of his good intentions.  A cordiality, even a kind of feeling which never existed before, was created between them; but of Francisco's mother, and the former events of his own life, the pirate never spoke.  Francisco more than once put questions on the subject; the answer was,--""You shall know some of these days, Francisco, but not yet; you would hate me too much!""  The _Avenger_ was now clear of the English isles, and with light winds running down the shores of Porto Rico.  In the evening of the day on which they had made the land, the schooner was becalmed about three miles from the shore, and the new first mate proposed that he should land in the boat and obtain a further supply of water from a fall which they had discovered with the glasses.  As this was necessary, Cain gave his consent, and the boat quitted the vessel full of breakers.  Now it happened that the _Avenger_ lay becalmed abreast of the country-seat of Don d'Alfarez, the governor of the island.  Clara had seen the schooner; and, as usual, had thrown out the white curtain as a signal of recognition; for there was no perceptible difference, even to a sailor, at that distance, between the _Avenger_ and the _Enterprise_. She had hastened down to the beach, and hurried into the cave, awaiting the arrival of Edward Templemore.  The pirate-boat landed at the very spot of rendezvous, and the mate leaped out of the boat.  Clara flew to receive her Edward, and was instantly seized by the mate, before she discovered her mistake.  ""Holy Virgin! who and what are you?"" cried she, struggling to disengage herself.  ""One who is very fond of a pretty girl!"" replied the pirate, still detaining her.  ""Unhand me, wretch!"" cried Clara.  ""Are you aware whom you are addressing?""  ""Not I! nor do I care,"" replied the pirate.  ""You will perhaps, sir, when you learn that I am the daughter of the governor!"" exclaimed Clara, pushing him away.  ""Yes! by heavens! you are right, pretty lady, I do care; for a governor's daughter will fetch a good ransom at all events.  So come, my lads, a little help here; for she is as strong as a young mule.  Never mind the water, throw the beakers into the boat again: we have a prize worth taking!""  Clara screamed; but she was gagged with a handkerchief and lifted into the boat, which immediately rowed back to the schooner.  When the mate came on board and reported his capture the pirates were delighted at the prospect of addition to their prize-money.  Cain could not, of course, raise any objections; it would have been so different from his general practice, that it would have strengthened suspicions already set afloat by Hawkhurst, which Cain was most anxious just then to remove.  He ordered the girl to be taken down into the cabin, hoisted in the boat, and the breeze springing up again, made sail.  In the mean time Francisco was consoling the unfortunate Clara, and assuring her that she need be under no alarm, promising her the protection of himself and the captain.  The poor girl wept bitterly, and it was not until Cain came down into the cabin and corroborated the assurances of Francisco that she could assume any degree of composure; but to find friends when she had expected every insult and degradation--for Francisco had acknowledged that the vessel was a pirate--was some consolation.  The kindness and attention of Francisco restored her to comparative tranquillity.  The next day she confided to him the reason of her coming to the beach, and her mistake with regard to the two vessels, and Francisco and Cain promised her that they would themselves pay her ransom, and not wait until she heard from her father.  To divert her thoughts Francisco talked much about Edward Templemore, and on that subject Clara could always talk.  Every circumstance attending the amour was soon known to Francisco.  But the _Avenger_ did not gain her rendezvous as soon as she expected. When to the northward of Porto Rico an English frigate bore down upon her, and the _Avenger_ was obliged to run for it.  Before the wind is always a schooner's worst point of sailing, and the chase was continued for three days before a fresh wind from the southward, until they had passed the Bahama Isles.  The pirates suffered much from want of water, as it was necessary still further to reduce their allowance.  The frigate was still in sight, although the _Avenger_ had dropped her astern when the wind became light, and at last it subsided into a calm, which lasted two days more. The boats of the frigate were hoisted out on the eve of the second day to attack the schooner, then distant five miles, when a breeze sprang up from the northward, and the schooner being then to windward, left the enemy hull down.  It was not until the next day that Cain ventured to run again to the southward to procure at one of the keys the water so much required.  At last it was obtained, but with difficulty and much loss of time, from the scantiness of the supply, and they again made sail for the Caicos. But they were so much impeded by contrary winds and contrary currents that it was not until three weeks after they had been chased from Porto Rico that they made out the low land of their former rendezvous.  We must now return to Edward Templemore in the _Enterprise_, whom we left off the coast of South America in search of the _Avenger_, which had so strangely slipped through their fingers.  Edward had examined the whole coast, ran through the passage and round Trinidad, and then started off to the Leeward Isles in his pursuit.  He had spoken every vessel he met with without gaining any information, and had at last arrived off Porto Rico.  This was no time to think of Clara; but, as it was not out of his way, he had run down the island, and as it was just before dark when he arrived off that part of the coast where the governor resided, he had hove to for a little while, and had examined the windows: but the signal of recognition was not made, and after waiting till dark he again made sail, mad with disappointment, and fearing that all had been discovered by the governor; whereas the fact was, that he had only arrived two days after the forcible abduction of Clara.  Once more he directed his attention to the discovery of the pirate, and after a fortnight's examination of the inlets and bays of the Island of St. Domingo without success, his provisions and water being nearly expended, he returned, in no very happy mood, to Port Royal.  In the mean time the disappearance of Clara had created the greatest confusion in Porto Rico, and upon the examination of her attendant, who was confronted by the friar and the duenna, the amour of her mistress was confessed.  The appearance of the _Avenger_ off the coast on that evening confirmed their ideas that the Donna Clara had been carried off by the English lieutenant, and Don Alfarez immediately despatched a vessel to Jamaica, complaining of the outrage, and demanding the restoration of his daughter.  This vessel arrived at Port Royal a few days before the _Enterprise_, and the admiral was very much astonished.  He returned a very polite answer to Don Alfarez, promising an investigation immediately upon the arrival of the schooner, and to send a vessel with the result of the said investigation.  ""This is a pretty business,"" said the admiral to his secretary.  ""Young madcap, I sent him to look after a pirate and he goes after the governor's daughter!  By the lord Harry, Mr Templemore, but you and I shall have an account to settle.""  ""I can hardly believe it, sir,"" replied the secretary; ""and yet it does look suspicious.  But on so short an acquaintance--""  ""Who knows that, Mr Hadley?  Send for his logs, and let us examine them; he may have been keeping up the acquaintance.""  The logs of the _Enterprise_ were examined, and there were the fatal words--Porto Rico, Porto Rico, bearing in every division of the compass, and in every separate cruise, nay, even when the schooner was charged with despatches.  ""Plain enough,"" said the admiral.  ""Confounded young scamp, to embroil me in this way!  Not that his marrying the girl is any business of mine; but I will punish him for disobedience of orders, at all events.  Try him by a court-martial, by heavens!""  The secretary made no reply: he knew very well that the admiral would do no such thing.  ""The _Enterprise_ anchored at daylight, sir,"" reported the secretary as the admiral sat down to breakfast.  ""And where's Mr Templemore?""  ""He is outside in the veranda.  They have told him below of what he has been accused, and he swears it is false.  I believe him, sir, for he appears half mad at the intelligence.""  ""Stop a moment.  Have you looked over his log?""  ""Yes, sir.  It appears that he was off Porto Rico on the 19th; but the Spanish governor's letter says that he was there on the 17th, and again made his appearance on the 19th.  I mentioned it to him, and he declares upon his honour that he was only there on the 19th, as stated in his log.""  ""Well, let him come in and speak for himself.""  Edward came in, in a state of great agitation.  ""Well, Mr Templemore, you have been playing pretty tricks!  What is all this, sir?  Where is the girl, sir--the governor's daughter?""  ""Where she is, sir, I cannot pretend to say; but I feel convinced that she has been carried off by the pirates.""  ""Pirates!  Poor girl, I pity her!--and--I pity you too, Edward.  Come, sit down here, and tell me all that has happened.""  Edward knew the admiral's character so well, that he immediately disclosed all that had passed between him and Clara.  He then stated how the _Avenger_ had escaped him by deceiving the frigate, and the agreement made with Clara to meet for the future on the beach, and his conviction that the pirate schooner, so exactly similar in appearance to the _Enterprise_, must have preceded him at Porto Rico, and have carried off the object of his attachment.  Although Edward might have been severely taken to task, yet the admiral pitied him, and, therefore, said nothing about his visits to Porto Rico. When breakfast was over he ordered the signal to be made for a sloop of war to prepare to weigh, and the _Enterprise_ to be revictualled by the boats of the squadron.  ""Now, Edward, you and the _Comus_ shall sail in company after this rascally pirate, and I trust you will give me a good account of her, and also of the governor's daughter.  Cheer up, my boy! depend upon it they will try for ransom before they do her any injury.""  That evening the _Enterprise_ and _Comus_ sailed on their expedition, and having run by Porto Rico and delivered a letter to the governor, they steered to the northward, and early the next morning made the land of the Caicos, just as the _Avenger_ had skirted the reefs and bore up for the narrow entrance.  ""There she is!"" exclaimed Edward; ""there she is, by heavens!"" making the signal for the enemy, which was immediately answered by the _Comus_.    CHAPTER SIXTEEN.  THE CAICOS.  The small patch of islands called the Caicos, or Cayques, is situated about two degrees to the northward of Saint Domingo, and is nearly the southernmost of a chain which extends up to the Bahamas.  Most of the islands of this chain are uninhabited, but were formerly the resort of piratical vessels,--the reefs and shoals with which they are all surrounded afforded them protection from their larger pursuers, and the passages through this dangerous navigation being known only to the pirates who frequented them, proved an additional security.  The largest of the Caicos islands forms a curve, like an opened horseshoe, to the southward, with safe and protected anchorage when once in the bay on the southern side; but, previous to arriving at the anchorage, there are coral reefs, extending upwards of forty miles, through which it is necessary to conduct a vessel.  This passage is extremely intricate, but was well known to Hawkhurst, who had hitherto been pilot.  Cain was not so well acquainted with it and it required the greatest care in taking in the vessel, as, on the present occasion, Hawkhurst could not be called upon for this service.  The islands themselves--for there were several of them--were composed of coral rock; a few cocoa-trees raised their lofty heads where there was sufficient earth for vegetation, and stunted brush-wood rose up between the interstices of the rocks.  But the chief peculiarity of the islands, and which rendered them suitable to those who frequented them, was the numerous caves with which the rocks were perforated, some above high-water mark, but the majority with the sea-water flowing in and out of them, in some cases merely rushing in, and at high-water filling deep pools, which were detached from each other when the tide receded, in others with a sufficient depth of water at all times to allow you to pull in with a large boat.  It is hardly necessary to observe how convenient the higher and dry caves were as receptacles for articles which were intended to be concealed until an opportunity occurred for disposing of them.  In our last chapter we stated that, just as the _Avenger_ had entered the passage through the reefs, the _Comus_ and _Enterprise_ hove in sight and discovered her: but it will be necessary to explain the positions of the vessels.  The _Avenger_ had entered the southern channel, with the wind from the southward, and had carefully sounded her way for about four miles, under little or no sail.  The _Enterprise_ and _Comus_ had been examining Turk's Island, to the eastward of the Caicos, and had passed to the northward of it on the larboard tack, standing in for the northern point of the reef, which joined on to the great Caicos Island.  They were, therefore, in a situation to intercept the _Avenger_ before she arrived at her anchorage, had it not been for the reefs that barred their passage.  The only plan which the English vessels could act upon was to beat to the southward, so as to arrive at the entrance of the passage, when the _Enterprise_ would, of course, find sufficient water to follow the _Avenger_; for, as the passage was too narrow to beat through, and the wind was from the southward, the _Avenger_ could not possibly escape. She was caught in a trap; and all that she had to trust to was the defence which she might be able to make in her stronghold against the force which could be employed in the attack.  The breeze was fresh from the southward, and appeared inclined to increase, when the _Comus_ and _Enterprise_ made all sail, and worked, in short tacks, outside the reef.  On board the _Avenger_, the enemy and their motions were clearly distinguished, and Cain perceived that he was in an awkward dilemma. That they would be attacked he had no doubt; and although, at any other time, he would almost have rejoiced in such an opportunity of discomfiting his assailants, yet now he thought very differently, and would have sacrificed almost everything to have been able to avoid the rencontre, and be permitted quietly to withdraw himself from his associates, without the spilling of more blood.  Francisco was equally annoyed at this unfortunate collision; but no words were exchanged between him and the pirate-captain during the time that they were on deck.  It was about nine o'clock, when having safely passed nearly half through the channel, that Cain ordered the kedge-anchor to be dropped, and sent down the people to their breakfast.  Francisco went down into the cabin, and was explaining their situation to Clara, when Cain entered.  He threw himself on the locker, and appeared lost in deep and sombre meditation.  ""What do you intend to do?"" said Francisco.  ""I do not know; I will not decide myself, Francisco,"" replied Cain.  ""If I were to act upon my own judgment, probably I should allow the schooner to remain where she is.  They can only attack in the boats, and, in such a case, I do not fear; whereas, if we run right through, we allow the other schooner to follow us, without defending the passage; and we may be attacked by her in the deep water inside, and overpowered by the number of men the two vessels will be able to bring against us.  On the other hand, we certainly may defend the schooner from the shore as well as on board; but we are weak-handed.  I shall, however, call up the ship's company and let them decide.  God knows, if left to me I would not fight at all.""  ""Is there no way of escape?"" resumed Francisco.  ""Yes, we might abandon the schooner; and this night, when they would not expect it, run with the boats through the channel between the great island and the north Cayque: but that I daren't propose, and the men would not listen to it: indeed, I very much doubt if the enemy will allow us the time.  I knew this morning, long before we saw those vessels, that my fate would be decided before the sun went down.""  ""What do you mean?""  ""I mean this, Francisco,"" said Cain; ""that your mother, who always has visited me in my dreams whenever anything (dreadful now to think of!) was about to take place, appeared to me last night; and there was sorrow and pity in her sweet face as she mournfully waved her hand, as if to summon me to follow her.  Yes, thank God! she no longer looked upon me as for many years she has done.""  Francisco made no answer; and Cain again seemed to be lost in meditation.  After a little while Cain rose, and taking a small packet from one of the drawers, put it into the hands of Francisco.  ""Preserve that,"" said the pirate-captain; ""should any accident happen to me, it will tell you who was your mother; and it also contains directions for finding treasure which I have buried.  I leave everything to you, Francisco.  It has been unfairly obtained; but you are not the guilty party, and there are none to claim it.  Do not answer me now. You may find friends, whom you will make after I am gone, of the same opinion as I am.  I tell you again, be careful of that packet.""  ""I see little chance of it availing me,"" replied Francisco.  ""If I live, shall I not be considered as a pirate?""  ""No, no; you can prove the contrary.""  ""I have my doubts.  But God's will be done!""  ""Yes, God's will be done!"" said Cain, mournfully.  ""I dared not have said that a month ago.""  And the pirate-captain went on deck, followed by Francisco.  The crew of the _Avenger_ were summoned aft, and called upon to decide as to the measures they considered to be most advisable.  They preferred weighing the anchor and running into the bay, where they would be able to defend the schooner, in their opinion, much better than by remaining where they were.  The crew of the pirate-schooner weighed the anchor and continued their precarious course: the breeze had freshened, and the water was in strong ripples, so that they could no longer see the danger beneath her bottom. In the meantime, the sloop of war and _Enterprise_ continued to turn to windward outside the reef.  By noon the wind had considerably increased, and the breakers now turned and broke in wild foam over the coral reefs, in every direction.  The sail was still more reduced on board the _Avenger_, and her difficulties increased from the rapidity of her motion.  A storm-jib was set, and the others hauled down yet even under this small sail she flew before the wind.  Cain stood at the bowsprit, giving his directions to the helmsman.  More than once they had grazed the rocks and were clear again.  Spars were towed astern, and every means resorted to, to check her way.  They had no guide but the breaking of the wild water on each side of them.  ""Why should not Hawkhurst, who knows the passage so well, be made to pilot us?"" said the boatswain to those who were near him on the forecastle.  ""To be sure! let's have him up!"" cried several of the crew; and some of them went down below.  In a minute they reappeared with Hawkhurst, whom they led forward.  He did not make any resistance, and the crew demanded that he should pilot the vessel.  ""And suppose I will not?"" said Hawkhurst, coolly.  ""Then you lose your passage, that's all,"" replied the boatswain.  ""Is it not so, my lads?"" continued he, appealing to the crew.  ""Yes; either take us safe in, or--overboard,"" replied several.  ""I do not mind that threat, my lads,"" replied Hawkhurst; ""you have all known me as a good man and true, and it's not likely that I shall desert you now.  Well, since your captain there cannot save you, I suppose I must; but,"" exclaimed he, looking about him, ""how's this?  We are out of the passage already.  Yes--and whether we can get into it again I cannot tell.""  ""We are not out of the passage,"" said Cain; ""you know we are not.""  ""Well, then, if the captain knows better than I, he had better take you through,"" rejoined Hawkhurst.  But the crew thought differently, and insisted that Hawkhurst, who well knew the channel, should take charge.  Cain retired aft, as Hawkhurst went out on the bowsprit.  ""I will do my best, my lads,"" said Hawkhurst ""but recollect, if we strike in trying to get into the right channel, do not blame me. Starboard a little--starboard yet--steady, so--there's the true passage my lads,"" cried he, pointing to some smoother water between the breakers; ""port a little--steady.""  But Hawkhurst, who knew that he was to be put on shore as soon as convenient, had resolved to lose the schooner, even if his own life were forfeited, and he was now running her out of the passage on the rocks. A minute after he had conned her, she struck heavily again and again. The third time she struck, she came broadside to the wind and heeled over: a sharp coral rock found its way through her slight timbers and planking, and the water poured in rapidly.  During this there was a dead silence on the part of the marauders.  ""My lads,"" said Hawkhurst, ""I have done my best, and now you may throw me overboard if you please.  It was not my fault, but his,"" continued he, pointing to the captain.  ""It is of little consequence whose fault it was, Mr Hawkhurst,"" replied Cain; ""we will settle that point by-and-by; at present we have too much on our hands.  Out boats, men! as fast as you can, and let every man provide himself with arms and ammunition.  Be cool! the schooner is fixed hard enough, and will not go down; we shall save everything by-and-by.""  The pirates obeyed the orders of the captain.  The three boats were hoisted out and lowered down.  In the first were placed all the wounded men and Clara d'Alfarez, who was assisted up by Francisco.  As soon as the men had provided themselves with arms, Francisco, to protect Clara, offered to take charge of her, and the boat shoved off.  The men-of-war had seen the _Avenger_ strike on the rocks, and the preparations of the crew to take to their boats.  They immediately hove to, hoisted out and manned their own boats, with the hopes of cutting them off before they could gain the island and prepare for a vigorous defence; for, although the vessels could not approach the reefs, there was sufficient water in many places for the boats to pass over them. Shortly after Francisco, in the first boat, had shoved off from the _Avenger_, the boats of the men-of-war were darting through the surf to intercept them.  The pirates perceived this, and hastened their arrangements; a second boat soon left her, and into that Hawkhurst leaped as it was shoving off.  Cain remained on board, going round the lower decks to ascertain if any of the wounded men were left; he then quitted the schooner in the last boat and followed the others, being about a quarter of a mile astern of the second, in which Hawkhurst had secured his place.  At the time that Cain quitted the schooner, it was difficult to say whether the men-of-war's boats would succeed in intercepting any of the pirate's boats.  Both parties exerted themselves to their utmost; and when the first boat, with Francisco and Clara, landed, the headmost of the assailants was not much more than half a mile from them; but, shallow water intervening, there was a delay, which was favourable to the pirate.  Hawkhurst landed in his boat as the launch of the _Comus_ fired her eighteen-pound carronade.  The last boat was yet two hundred yards from the beach, when another shot from the _Comus's_ launch, which had been unable hitherto to find a passage through the reef, struck her on the counter, and she filled and went down.  ""He is gone!"" exclaimed Francisco, who had led Clara to a cave, and stood at the mouth of it to protect her: ""they have sunk his boat--no, he is swimming to the shore, and will be here soon, long before the English seamen can land.""  This was true.  Cain was breasting the water manfully, making for a small cove nearer to where the boat was sunk than the one in which Francisco had landed with Clara and the wounded men, and divided from the other by a ridge of rocks which separated the sandy beach, and extended some way into the water before they were submerged.  Francisco could easily distinguish the pirate-captain from the other men, who also were swimming for the beach; for Cain was far ahead of them, and as he gained nearer to the shore he was shut from Francisco's sight by the ridge of rocks.  Francisco, anxious for his safety, climbed up the rocks and was watching.  Cain was within a few yards of the beach when there was the report of a musket; the pirate-captain was seen to raise his body convulsively half out of the water--he floundered--the clear blue wave was discoloured--he sank, and was seen no more.  Francisco darted forward from the rocks, and perceived Hawkhurst, standing beneath them with the musket in his hand, which he was recharging.  ""Villain!"" exclaimed Francisco, ""you shall account for this.""  Hawkhurst had reprimed his musket and shut the pan.  ""Not to you,"" replied Hawkhurst, levelling his piece, and taking aim at Francisco.  The ball struck Francisco on the breast; he reeled back from his position, staggered across the sand, gained the cave, and fell at the feet of Clara.  ""Oh, God!"" exclaimed the poor girl, ""are you hurt? who is there then, to protect me?""  ""I hardly know,"" replied Francisco, faintly; and, at intervals, ""I feel no wound, I feel stronger;"" and Francisco put his hand to his heart.  Clara opened his vest, and found that the packet given to Francisco by Cain, and which he had deposited in his breast, had been struck by the bullet, which had done him no injury further than the violent concussion of the blow--notwithstanding he was faint from the shock, and his head fell upon Clara's bosom.  But we must relate the proceedings of those who were mixed up in this exciting scene.  Edward Templemore had watched from his vessel, with an eager and painful curiosity, the motions of the schooner--her running on the rocks, and the subsequent actions of the intrepid marauders.  The long telescope enabled him to perceive distinctly all that passed, and his feelings were increased into a paroxysm of agony when his straining eyes beheld the white and fluttering habiliments of a female for a moment at the gunwale of the stranded vessel--her descent, as it appeared to him, nothing loth, into the boat--the arms held out to receive, and the extension of hers to meet those offered.  Could it be Clara?  Where was the reluctance, the unavailing attempts at resistance, which should have characterised her situation?  Excited by feelings which he dared not analyse, he threw down his glass, and seizing his sword, sprang into the boat, which was ready manned alongside, desiring the others to follow him.  For once, and the only time in his existence when approaching the enemy, did he feel his heart sink within him--a cold tremor ran through his whole frame, and as he called to mind the loose morals and desperate habits of the pirates, horrible thoughts entered his imagination.  As he neared the shore, he stood up in the stern-sheets of the boat, pale, haggard, and with trembling lips; and the intensity of his feelings would have been intolerable but for a more violent thirst for revenge.  He clenched his sword, while the quick throbs of his heart seemed, at every pulsation, to repeat to him his thoughts of blood! blood! blood!  He approached the small bay and perceived that there was a female at the mouth of the cave--nearer and nearer, and he was certain that it was his Clara--her name was on his lips when he heard the two shots fired one after another by Hawkhurst-- he saw the retreat and fall of Francisco--when, madness to behold! he perceived Clara rush forward, and there lay the young man supported by her, and with his head on her bosom.  Could he believe what he saw! could she really be his betrothed!  Yes, there she was, supporting the handsome figure of a young man, and that man a pirate--she had even put her hand into his vest, and was now watching over his reviving form. Edward could bear no more: he covered his eyes, and now, maddened with jealousy, in a voice of thunder, he called out:  ""Give way, my lads! for your lives, give way!""  The gig was within half-a-dozen strokes of the oar from the beach, and Clara, unconscious of wrong, had just taken the packet of papers from Francisco's vest, when Hawkhurst made his appearance from behind the rocks which separated the two little sandy coves.  Francisco had recovered his breath, and, perceiving the approach of Hawkhurst, he sprang upon his feet to recover his musket; but, before he could succeed, Hawkhurst had closed in with him, and a short and dreadful struggle ensued.  It would soon have terminated fatally to Francisco, for the superior strength of Hawkhurst had enabled him to bear down the body of his opponent with his knee; and he was fast strangling him by twisting his handkerchief round his throat, while Clara shrieked, and attempted in vain to tear the pirate from him.  As the prostrate Francisco was fast blackening into a corse, and the maiden screamed for pity, and became frantic in her efforts for his rescue, the boat dashed high up on the sand; and, with the bound of a maddened tiger, Edward sprang upon Hawkhurst, tearing him down on his back, and severing his wrist with his sword-blade until his hold of Francisco was relaxed, and he wrestled in his own defence.  ""Seize him, my lads!"" said Edward, pointing with his left hand to Hawkhurst; as with his sword directed to the body of Francisco he bitterly continued, ""_This victim is mine_!""  But whatever were his intentions, they were frustrated by Clara's recognition, who shrieked out, ""My Edward!"" sprang into his arms, and was immediately in a state of insensibility.  The seamen who had secured Hawkhurst looked upon the scene with curious astonishment, while Edward waited with mingled feelings of impatience and doubt for Clara's recovery: he wished to be assured by her that he was mistaken, and he turned again and again from her face to that of Francisco, who was fast recovering.  During this painful suspense, Hawkhurst was bound and made to sit down.  ""Edward! dear Edward!"" said Clara, at last, in a faint voice, clinging more closely to him; ""and am I then rescued by thee, dearest!""  Edward felt the appeal; but his jealousy had not yet subsided.  ""Who is that, Clara?"" said he sternly.  ""It is Francisco.  No pirate, Edward, but my preserver.""  ""Ha, ha!"" laughed Hawkhurst, with a bitter sneer, for he perceived how matters stood.  Edward Templemore turned towards him with an inquiring look.  ""Ha, ha!"" continued Hawkhurst; ""why, he is the captain's son!  No pirate, eh?  Well, what will women not swear to, to save those they dote upon!""  ""If the captain's son,"" said Edward, ""why were you contending?""  ""Because just now I shot his scoundrel father.""  ""Edward!"" said Clara, solemnly, ""this is no time for explanation, but, as I hope for mercy, what I have said is true; believe not the villain.""  ""Yes,"" said Francisco, who was now sitting up, ""believe him when he says that he shot the captain, for that is true; but, sir, if you value your own peace of mind, believe nothing to the prejudice of that young lady.""  ""I hardly know what to believe,"" muttered Edward Templemore; ""but, as the lady says, this is no time for explanation.  With your permission, madam,"" said he to Clara, ""my coxswain will see you in safety on board of the schooner, or the other vessel, if you prefer it; my duty will not allow me to accompany you.""  Clara darted a reproachful yet fond look on Edward, as, with swimming eyes, she was led by the coxswain to the boat, which had been joined by the launch of the _Comus_, the crew of which were, with their officers, wading to the beach.  The men of the gig remained until they had given Hawkhurst and Francisco in charge of the other seamen, and then shoved off with Clara for the schooner.  Edward Templemore gave one look at the gig as it conveyed Clara on board, and ordering Hawkhurst and Francisco to be taken to the launch, and a guard to be kept over them, went up, with the remainder of the men, in pursuit of the pirates.  During the scene we have described, the other boats of the men-of-war had landed on the island, and the _Avenger's_ crew, deprived of their leaders, and scattered in every direction, were many of them slain or captured.  In about two hours it was supposed that the majority of the pirates had been accounted for, and the prisoners being now very numerous, it was decided that the boats should return with them to the _Comus_, the captain of which vessel, as commanding officer, would then issue orders as to their future proceedings.  The captured pirates, when mustered on the deck of the _Comus_, amounted to nearly sixty, out of which number one-half were those who had been sent on shore wounded, and had surrendered without resistance.  Of killed there were fifteen; and it was conjectured that as many more had been drowned in the boat when she was sunk by the shot from the carronade of the launch.  Although, by the account given by the captured pirates, the majority were secured, yet there was reason to suppose that some were still left on the island concealed in the caves.  As the captain of the _Comus_ had orders to return as soon as possible, he decided to sail immediately for Port Royal with the prisoners, leaving the _Enterprise_ to secure the remainder, if there were any, and recover anything of value which might be left in the wreck of the _Avenger_, and then to destroy her.  With the usual celerity of the service these orders were obeyed.  The pirates, among whom Francisco was included, were secured, the boats hoisted up, and in half an hour the _Comus_ displayed her ensign, and made all sail on a wind, leaving Edward Templemore with the _Enterprise_, at the back of the reef, to perform the duties entailed upon him; and Clara, who was on board of the schooner, to remove the suspicion and jealousy which had arisen in the bosom of her lover.    CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.  THE TRIAL.  In a week, the _Comus_ arrived at Port Royal, and the captain went up to the Penn to inform the admiral of the successful result of the expedition.  ""Thank God,"" said the admiral, ""we have caught these villains at last! A little hanging will do them no harm.  The captain, you say, was drowned?""  ""So it is reported, sir,"" replied Captain Manly; ""he was in the last boat which left the schooner, and she was sunk by a shot from the launch.""  ""I am sorry for that; the death was too good for him.  However, we must make an example of the rest; they must be tried by the Admiralty Court, which has the jurisdiction of the high seas.  Send them on shore, Manly, and we wash our hands of them.""  ""Very good, sir: but there are still some left on the island, we have reason to believe; and the _Enterprise_ is in search of them.""  ""By-the-by, did Templemore find his lady?""  ""Oh yes, sir; and--all's right, I believe: but I had very little to say to him on the subject.""  ""Humph!"" replied the admiral.  ""I am glad to hear it.  Well, send them on shore, Manly, to the proper authorities.  If any more be found, they must be hung afterwards when Templemore brings them in.  I am more pleased at having secured these scoundrels than if we had taken a French frigate.""  About three weeks after this conversation, the secretary reported to the admiral that the _Enterprise_ had made her number outside; but that she was becalmed, and would not probably be in until the evening.  ""That's a pity,"" replied the admiral; ""for the pirates are to be tried this morning.  He may have more of them on board.""  ""Very true, sir; but the trial will hardly be over to-day: the judge will not be in court till one o'clock at the soonest.""  ""It's of little consequence, certainly; as it is, there are so many that they must be hanged by divisions.  However, as he is within signal distance, let them telegraph `Pirates now on trial.'  He can pull on shore in his gig, if he pleases.""  It was about noon on the same day that the pirates, and among them Francisco, escorted by a strong guard, were conducted to the Court House, and placed at the bar.  The Court House was crowded to excess, for the interest excited was intense.  Many of them who had been wounded in the attack upon the property of Don Cumanos, and afterwards captured, had died in their confinement.  Still forty-five were placed at the bar; and their picturesque costume, their bearded faces, and the atrocities which they had committed, created in those present a sensation of anxiety mingled with horror and indignation.  Two of the youngest amongst them had been permitted to turn king's evidence.  They had been on board of the _Avenger_ but a few months; still their testimony as to the murder of the crews of three West India ships, and the attack upon the property of Don Cumanos, was quite sufficient to condemn the remainder.  Much time was necessarily expended in going through the forms of the court; in the pirates answering to their various names; and, lastly, in taking down the detailed evidence of the above men.  It was late when the evidence was read over to the pirates, and they were asked if they had anything to offer in their defence.  The question was repeated by the judge; when Hawkhurst was the first to speak.  To save himself he could scarcely hope; his only object was to prevent Francisco pleading his cause successfully, and escaping the same disgraceful death.  Hawkhurst declared that he had been some time on board the _Avenger_, but that he had been taken out of a vessel and forced to serve against his will, as could be proved by the captain's son, who stood there (pointing to Francisco), who had been in the schooner since her first fitting out:--that he had always opposed the captain, who would not part with him, because he was the only one on board who was competent to navigate the schooner: that he had intended to rise against him, and take the vessel, having often stimulated the crew so to do; and that, as the other men, as well as the captain's son, could prove, if they chose, he actually was in confinement for that attempt when the schooner was entering the passage to the Caicos; and that he was only released because he was acquainted with the passage, and threatened to be thrown overboard if he did not take her in; that, at every risk, he had run her on the rocks; and aware that the captain would murder him, he had shot Cain as he was swimming to the shore, as the captain's son could prove; for he had taxed him with it, and he was actually struggling with him for life, when the officers and boat's crew separated them, and made them both prisoners: that he hardly expected that Francisco, the captain's son, would tell the truth to save him, as he was his bitter enemy, and in the business at the Magdalen river, which had been long planned (for Francisco had been sent on shore under the pretence of being wrecked, but, in fact, to ascertain where the booty was, and to assist the pirates in their attack), Francisco had taken the opportunity of putting a bullet through his shoulder, which was well known to the other pirates, and Francisco could not venture to deny.  He trusted that the court would order the torture to Francisco, and then he would probably speak the truth; at all events, let him speak now.  When Hawkhurst had ceased to address the court, there was an anxious pause for some minutes.  The day was fast declining, and most parts of the spacious Court House were already deeply immersed in gloom; while the light, sober, solemn, and almost sad, gleamed upon the savage and reckless countenances of the prisoners at the bar.  The sun had sunk down behind a mass of heavy yet gorgeous clouds, fringing their edges with molten gold.  Hawkhurst had spoken fluently and energetically, and there was an appearance of almost honesty in his coarse and deep-toned voice.  Even the occasional oaths with which his speech was garnished, but which we have omitted, seemed to be pronounced more in sincerity than in blasphemy, and gave a more forcible impression to his narrative.  We have said, that when he concluded there was a profound silence; and amid the fast-falling shadows of the evening, those who were present began to feel, for the first time, the awful importance of the drama before them, the number of lives which were trembling upon the verge of existence, depending upon the single word of ""Guilty.""  This painful silence, this harrowing suspense, was at last broken by a restrained sob from a female; but owing to the obscurity involving the body of the court, her person could not be distinguished.  The wail of a woman so unexpected--for who could there be of that sex interested in the fate of these desperate men?--touched the heart of its auditors, and appeared to sow the first seeds of compassionate and humane feeling among those who had hitherto expressed and felt nothing but indignation towards the prisoners.  The judge upon the bench, the counsel at the bar, and the jury impannelled in their box, felt the force of the appeal; and it softened down the evil impression created by the address of Hawkhurst against the youthful Francisco.  The eyes of all were now directed towards the one doubly accused--accused not only by the public prosecutor, but even by his associate in crime,--and the survey was favourable.  They acknowledged that he was one whose personal qualities might indeed challenge the love of woman in his pride, and her lament in his disgrace; and as their regard was directed towards him, the sun, which had been obscured, now pierced through a break in the mass of clouds, and threw a portion of his glorious beams from a window opposite upon him, and him alone, while all the other prisoners who surrounded him were buried more or less in deep shadow.  It was at once evident that his associates were bold yet commonplace villains--men who owed their courage, their only virtue perhaps, to their habits, to their physical organisation, or the influence of those around them.  They were mere human butchers, with the only adjunct that, now that the trade was to be exercised upon themselves, they could bear it with sullen apathy--a feeling how far removed from true fortitude!  Even Hawkhurst, though more commanding than the rest, with all his daring mien and scowl of defiance, looked nothing more than a distinguished ruffian.  With the exception of Francisco, the prisoners had wholly neglected their personal appearance; and in them the squalid and sordid look of the mendicant seemed allied with the ferocity of the murderer.  Francisco was not only an exception, but formed a beautiful contrast to the others; and as the evening beams lighted up his figure, he stood at the bar, if not with all the splendour of a hero of romance, certainly a most picturesque and interesting personage, elegantly if not richly attired.  The low sobs at intervals repeated, as if impossible to be checked, seemed to rouse and call him to a sense of the important part which he was called upon to act in the tragedy there and then performing.  His face was pale, yet composed; his mien at once proud and sorrowful: his eye was bright, yet his glance was not upon those in court, but far away, fixed, like an eagle's, upon the gorgeous beams of the setting sun, which glowed upon him through the window that was in front of him.  At last the voice of Francisco was heard, and all in that wide court started at the sound--deep, full, and melodious as the evening chimes. The ears of those present had, in the profound silence, but just recovered from the harsh, deep-toned, and barbarous idiom of Hawkhurst's address, when the clear, silvery, yet manly voice of Francisco, riveted their attention.  The jury stretched forth their heads, the counsel and all in court turned anxiously round towards the prisoner, even the judge held up his forefinger to intimate his wish for perfect silence.  ""My lord and gentlemen,"" commenced Francisco, ""when I first found myself in this degrading situation, I had not thought to have spoken or to have uttered one word in my defence.  He that has just now accused me has recommended the torture to be applied; he has already had his wish, for what torture can be more agonising than to find myself where I now am? So tortured, indeed, have I been through a short yet wretched life, that I have often felt that anything short of self-destruction which would release me would be a blessing; but within these few minutes I have been made to acknowledge that I have still feelings in unison with my fellow-creatures; that I am not yet fit for death, and all too young, too unprepared to die: for who would not reluctantly leave this world while there is such a beauteous sky to love and look upon, or while there is one female breast who holds him innocent, and has evinced her pity for his misfortunes?  Yes, my lord! mercy, and pity, and compassion, have not yet fled from earth; and therefore do I feel I am too young to die.  God forgive me! but I thought they had--for never have they been shown in those with whom by fate I have been connected; and it has been from this conviction that I have so often longed for death.  And now may that righteous God who judges us not here, but hereafter, enable me to prove that I do not deserve an ignominious punishment from my fellow-sinners--men!  ""My lord, I know not the subtleties of the laws, nor the intricacy of pleadings.  First, let me assert that I have never robbed; but I have restored unto the plundered: I have never murdered; but I have stood between the assassin's knife and his victim.  For this have I been hated and reviled by my associates, and for this, is my life now threatened by those laws against which I never had offended.  The man who last addressed you has told you that I am the pirate-captain's son; it is the assertion of the only irreclaimable and utterly remorseless villain among those who now stand before you to be judged--the assertion of one whose glory, whose joy, whose solace has been blood-shedding.  ""My lord, I had it from the mouth of the captain himself, previous to his murder by that man, that I was not his son.  His son! thank God, not so.  Connected with him and in his power I was, most certainly and most incomprehensibly.  Before he died, he delivered me a packet that would have told me who I am; but I have lost it, and deeply have I felt the loss.  One only fact I gained from him whom they would call my father, which is, that with his own hand he slew--yes, basely slew--my mother.""  The address of Francisco was here interrupted by a low deep groan of anguish, which startled the whole audience.  It was now quite dark, and the judge ordered the court to be lighted previous to the defence being continued.  The impatience and anxiety of those present were shown in low murmurs of communication until the lights were brought in.  The word ""Silence!"" from the judge produced an immediate obedience, and the prisoner was ordered to proceed.  Francisco then continued his address, commencing with the remembrances of his earliest childhood.  As he warmed with his subject, he became more eloquent; his action became energetical without violence; and the pallid and modest youth gradually grew into the impassioned and inspired orator.  He recapitulated rapidly, yet distinctly and with terrible force, all the startling events in his fearful life.  There was truth in the tones of his voice, there was conviction in his animated countenance, there was innocence in his open and expressive brow.  All who heard believed; and scarcely had he concluded his address, when the jury appeared impatient to rise and give their verdict in his favour.  But the judge stood up, and, addressing the jury, told them that it was his most painful duty to remind them that as yet they had heard but assertion, beautiful and almost convincing assertion truly; but still it was not proof.  ""Alas!"" observed Francisco, ""what evidence can I bring forward, except the evidence of those around me at the bar, which will not be admitted? Can I recall the dead from the grave?  Can I expect those who have been murdered to rise again to assert my innocence?  Can I expect that Don Cumanos will appear from distant leagues to give evidence on my behalf? Alas he knows not how I am situated, or he would have flown to my succour.  No, no; not even can I expect that the sweet Spanish maiden, the last to whom I offered my protection, will appear in such a place as this to meet the bold gaze of hundreds!""  ""She is here!"" replied a manly voice; and a passage was made through the crowd; and Clara, supported by Edward Templemore, dressed in his uniform, was ushered into the box for the witnesses.  The appearance of the fair girl, who looked round her with alarm, created a great sensation.  As soon as she was sufficiently composed, she was sworn, and gave her evidence as to Francisco's behaviour during the time that she was a prisoner on board of the _Avenger_.  She produced the packet which had saved the life of Francisco, and substantiated a great part of his defence.  She extolled his kindness and his generosity; and when she had concluded, every one asked of himself, ""Can this young man be a pirate and a murderer?""  The reply was, ""It is impossible.""  ""My lord,"" said Edward Templemore, ""I request permission to ask the prisoner a question.  When I was on board of the wreck of the _Avenger_, I found this book floating in the cabin.  I wish to ask the prisoner, whether, as that young lady has informed me, it is his?""  And Edward Templemore produced the Bible.  ""It is mine,"" replied Francisco.  ""May I ask you by what means it came into your possession?""  ""It is the only relic left of one who is now no more.  It was the consolation of my murdered mother; it has since been mine.  Give it to me, sir; I may probably need its support now more than ever.""  ""Was your mother murdered, say you?"" cried Edward Templemore, with much agitation.  ""I have already said so; and I now repeat it.""  The judge again rose, and recapitulated the evidence to the jury. Evidently friendly to Francisco he was obliged to point out to them, that although the evidence of the young lady had produced much which might be offered in extenuation, and induce him to submit it to His Majesty, in hopes of his gracious pardon after condemnation, yet, that many acts in which the prisoner had been involved had endangered his life and no testimony had been brought forward to prove that he had not, at one time, acted with the pirates, although he might since have repented.  They would of course, remember that the evidence of the mate, Hawkhurst, was not of any value, and must dismiss any impression which it might have made against Francisco.  At the same time he had the unpleasant duty to point out, that the evidence of the Spanish lady was so far prejudicial, that it pointed out the good terms subsisting between the young man and the pirate-captain.  Much as he was interested in his fate, he must reluctantly remind the jury, that the evidence on the whole was not sufficient to clear the prisoner; and he considered it their duty to return a verdict of _guilty against all the prisoners at the bar_.  ""My lord,"" said Edward Templemore, a few seconds after the judge had resumed his seat; ""may not the contents of this packet, the seal of which I have not ventured to break, afford some evidence in favour of the prisoner?  Have you any objection that it should be opened previous to the jury delivering their verdict?""  ""None,"" replied the judge: ""but what are its supposed contents?""  ""The contents, my lord,"" replied Francisco, ""are in the writing of the pirate-captain.  He delivered that packet into my hands previous to our quitting the schooner, stating that it would inform me who were my parents.  My lord, in my present situation I claim that packet, and refuse that its contents should be read in court.  If I am to die an ignominious death, at least those who are connected with me shall not have to blush at my disgrace, for the secret of my parentage shall die with me.""  ""Nay--nay; be ruled by me,"" replied Edward Templemore, with much emotion.  ""In the narrative, the handwriting of which can be proved by the king's evidence, there may be acknowledgment of all you have stated, and it will be received as evidence; will it not, my lord?""  ""If the handwriting is proved, I should think it may,"" replied the judge, ""particularly as the lady was present when the packet was delivered, and heard the captain's assertion.  Will you allow it to be offered as evidence, young man?""  ""No, my lord,"" replied Francisco; ""unless I have permission first to peruse it myself.  I will not have its contents divulged, unless I am sure of an honourable acquittal.  The jury must deliver their verdict.""  The jury turned round to consult, during which Edward Templemore walked to Francisco, accompanied by Clara, to entreat him to allow the packet to be opened; but Francisco was firm against both their entreaties.  At last the foreman of the jury rose to deliver the verdict.  A solemn and awful silence prevailed throughout the court; the suspense was painful to a degree.  ""My lord,"" said the foreman of the jury, ""our verdict is--""  ""Stop, sir!"" said Edward Templemore as he clasped one arm round the astonished Francisco, and extended the other towards the foreman. ""Stop, sir! harm him not! for he is my brother!""  ""And my preserver!"" cried Clara, kneeling on the other side of Francisco, and holding up her hands in supplication.  The announcement was electrical; the foreman dropped into his seat; the judge and whole court were in mute astonishment.  The dead silence was followed by confusion, to which, after a time, the judge in vain attempted to put a stop.  Edward Templemore, Clara, and Francisco, continued to form the same group; and never was there one more beautiful.  And now that they were together, every one in court perceived the strong resemblance between the two young men.  Francisco's complexion was darker than Edward's from his constant exposure, from infancy, to a tropical sun; but the features of the two were the same.  It was some time before the judge could obtain silence in the court; and when it had been obtained, he was himself puzzled how to proceed.  Edward and Francisco, who had exchanged a few words, were now standing side by side.  ""My lord,"" said Edward Templemore, ""the prisoner consents that the packet shall be opened.""  ""I do,"" said Francisco, mournfully; ""although I have but little hope from its contents.  Alas! now that I have everything to live for--not that I cling to life, I feel as if every chance was gone!  The days of miracles have passed; and nothing but the miracle of the reappearance of the pirate-captain from the grave can prove my innocence.""  ""He reappears from the grave to prove thine innocence, Francisco!"" said a deep, hollow voice, which startled the whole court, and most of all Hawkhurst and the prisoners at the bar.  Still more did fear and horror distort their countenances when into the witness-box stalked the giant form of Cain.  But it was no longer the figure which we have described in the commencement of this narrative; his beard had been removed, and he was pale, wan, and emaciated.  His sunken eyes, his hollow cheek, and a short cough, which interrupted his speech, proved that his days were nearly at a close.  ""My lord,"" said Cain, addressing the judge, ""I am the pirate Cain, and was the captain of the _Avenger_!  Still am I free!  I come here voluntarily, that I may attest the innocence of that young man!  As yet, my hand has not known the manacle, nor my feet the gyves!  I am not a prisoner, nor included in the indictment, and at present my evidence is good.  None know me in this court, except those whose testimony, as prisoners, is unavailing; and therefore, to save that boy, and only to save him, I demand that I may be sworn.""  The oath was administered, with more than usual solemnity.  ""My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I have been in court since the commencement of the trial, and I declare that every word which Francisco has uttered in his own defence is true.  He is totally innocent of any act of piracy or murder; the packet would, indeed, have proved as much: but in that packet there are secrets which I wished to remain unknown to all but Francisco; and, rather than it should be opened, I have come forward myself.  How that young officer discovered that Francisco is his brother I know not; but if he also is the son of Cecilia Templemore, it is true.  But the packet will explain all.  ""And now, my lords, that my evidence is received, I am content: I have done one good deed before I die, and I surrender myself, as a pirate and a foul murderer, to justice.  True, my life is nearly closed--thanks to that villain there; but I prefer that I should meet that death I merit, as an expiation of my many deeds of guilt.""  Cain then turned to Hawkhurst, who was close to him, but the mate appeared to be in a state of stupor; he had not recovered from his first terror, and still imagined the appearance of Cain to be supernatural.  ""Villain!"" exclaimed Cain, putting his mouth close to Hawkhurst's ear; ""doubly damned villain! thou'lt die like a dog, and unrevenged!  The boy is safe, and I'm alive!""  ""Art thou really living?"" said Hawkhurst, recovering from his fear.  ""Yes, living--yes, flesh and blood; feel, wretch! feel this arm, and be convinced: thou hast felt the power of it before now,"" continued Cain, sarcastically.  ""And now, my lord, I have done.  Francisco, fare thee well!  I loved thee, and have proved my love.  Hate not, then, my memory, and forgive me--yes, forgive me when I'm no more,"" said Cain, who then turned his eyes to the ceiling of the court-house.--""Yes, there she is, Francisco!--there she is! and see,"" cried he, extending both arms above his head, ""she smiles upon--yes, Francisco, your sainted mother smiles and pardons--""  The sentence was not finished; for Hawkhurst, when Cain's arms were upheld, perceived his knife in his girdle, and, with the rapidity of thought, he drew it out, and passed it through the body of the pirate-captain.  Cain fell heavily on the floor while the court was again in confusion. Hawkhurst was secured, and Cain raised from the ground.  ""I thank thee, Hawkhurst!"" said Cain, in an expiring voice; ""another murder thou hast to answer for: and you have saved me from the disgrace, not of the gallows, but of the gallows in thy company.  Francisco, boy, farewell!"" and Cain groaned deeply, and expired.  Thus perished the renowned pirate-captain, who in his life had shed so much blood, and whose death produced another murder.  ""Blood for blood!""  The body was removed; and it now remained but for the jury to give their verdict.  All the prisoners were found guilty, with the exception of Francisco, who left the dock accompanied by his newly-found brother, and the congratulations of every individual who could gain access to him.    CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.  CONCLUSION.  Our first object will be to explain to the reader by what means Edward Templemore was induced to surmise that in Francisco, whom he considered as a rival, he had found a brother; and also to account for the reappearance of the pirate Cain.  In pursuance of his orders, Edward Templemore had proceeded on board of the wreck of the _Avenger_; and while his men were employed in collecting articles of great value which were on board of her, he had descended into the cabin, which was partly under water.  He had picked up a book floating near the lockers, and on examination found it to be a Bible.  Surprised at seeing such a book on board of a pirate, he had taken it with him when he returned to the _Enterprise_, and had shown it to Clara, who immediately recognised it as the property of Francisco.  The book was saturated with the salt water, and as Edward mechanically turned over the pages, he referred to the title-page to see if there was any name upon it.  There was not: but he observed that the blank or fly-leaf next to the binding had been pasted down, and that there was writing on the other side.  In its present state it was easily detached from the cover; and then, to his astonishment, he read the name of Cecilia Templemore--his own mother.  He knew well the history; how he had been saved, and his mother and brother supposed to be lost; and it may readily be imagined how great was his anxiety to ascertain by what means her Bible had come into the possession of Francisco.  He dared not think Francisco was his brother--that he was so closely connected with one he still supposed to be a pirate: but the circumstance was possible; and although he had intended to have remained a few days longer, he now listened to the entreaties of Clara, whose peculiar position on board was only to be justified by the peculiar position from which she had been rescued, and returning that evening to the wreck he set fire to her, and then made all sail for Port Royal.  Fortunately he arrived, as we have stated, on the day of the trial; and as soon as the signal was made by the admiral he immediately manned his gig, and, taking Clara with him, in case her evidence might be of use, arrived at the Court House when the trial was about half over.  In our last chapter but one, we stated that Cain had been wounded by Hawkhurst, when he was swimming on shore, and had sunk; the ball had entered his chest, and passed through his lungs.  The contest between Hawkhurst and Francisco, and their capture by Edward, had taken place on the other side of the ridge of rocks in the adjacent cove, and although Francisco had seen Cain disappear, and concluded that he was dead, it was not so; he had again risen above the water, and dropping his feet and finding bottom, he contrived to crawl out, and wade into a cave adjacent, where he lay down to die.  But in this cave there was one of the _Avenger's_ boats, two of the pirates mortally wounded, and the four Kroumen, who had concealed themselves there with the intention of taking no part in the conflict, and, as soon as it became dark, of making their escape in the boat, which they had hauled up dry into the cave.  Cain staggered in, recovered the dry land; and fell.  Pompey, the Krouman, perceiving his condition, went to his assistance and bound up his wound, and the stanching of the blood soon revived the pirate-captain.  The other pirates died unaided.  Although the island was searched in every direction, this cave, from the water flowing into it, escaped the vigilance of the British seamen; and when they re-embarked, with the majority of the pirates captured, Cain and the Kroumen were undiscovered.  As soon as it was dark, Cain informed them of his intentions; and although the Kroumen would probably have left him to his fate, yet, as they required his services to know how to steer to some other island, he was assisted into the stern-sheets, and the boat was backed out of the cave.  By the direction of Cain they passed through the passage between the great island and the northern Caique, and before daylight were far away from any chance of capture.  Cain had now to a certain degree recovered, and knowing that they were in the channel of the small traders, he pointed out to the Kroumen that, if supposed to be pirates, they would inevitably be punished, although not guilty, and that they must pass off as the crew of a small coasting-vessel which had been wrecked.  He then, with the assistance of Pompey, cut off his beard as close as he could, and arranged his dress in a more European style.  They had neither water nor provisions, and were exposed to a vertical sun.  Fortunately for them, and still more fortunately for Francisco, on the second day they were picked up by an American brig bound to Antigua.  Cain narrated his fictitious disasters, but said nothing about his wound, the neglect of which would certainly have occasioned his death a very few days after he appeared at the trial, had he not fallen by the malignity of Hawkhurst.  Anxious to find his way to Port Royal, for he was indifferent as to his own life, and only wished to save Francisco, he was overjoyed to meet a small schooner trading between the islands, bound to Port Royal.  In that vessel he obtained a passage for himself and the Kroumen, and had arrived three days previous to the trial, and during that time had remained concealed until the day that the Admiralty Court assembled.  It may be as well here to remark, that Cain's reason for not wishing the packet to be opened was, that among the other papers relative to Francisco were directions for the recovery of the treasure which he had concealed, and which, of course, he wished to be communicated to Francisco alone.  We will leave the reader to imagine what passed between Francisco and Edward after the discovery of their kindred, and proceed to state the contents of the packet, which the twin-brothers now opened in the presence of Clara alone.  We must, however, condense the matter, which was very voluminous.  It stated that Cain, whose real name was Charles Osborne, had sailed in a fine schooner from Bilboa, for the coast of Africa, to procure a cargo of slaves; and had been out about twenty-four hours when the crew perceived a boat apparently with no one in her, about a mile ahead of them.  The water was then smooth, and the vessel had but little way.  As soon as they came up with the boat, they lowered down their skiff to examine her.  The men sent in the skiff soon returned, towing the boat alongside. Lying at the bottom of the boat were found several men almost dead, and reduced to skeletons; and in the stern-sheets a negro woman, with a child at her breast, and a white female in the last state of exhaustion.  Osborne was then a gay and unprincipled man, but not a hardened villain and murderer, as he afterwards became; he had compassion and feeling-- they were all taken on board the schooner: some recovered, others were too much exhausted.  Among those restored was Cecilia Templemore and the infant, who at first had been considered quite dead; but the negro woman, exhausted by the demands of her nursling and her privations, expired as she was being removed from the boat.  A goat, that fortunately was on board, proved a substitute for the negress; and before Osborne had arrived off the coast, the child had recovered its health and vigour, and the mother her extreme beauty.  We must now pass over a considerable portion of the narrative.  Osborne was impetuous in his passions, and Cecilia Templemore became his victim. He had, indeed, afterwards quieted her qualms of conscience by a pretended marriage, when he arrived at the Brazils with his cargo of human flesh.  But that was little alleviation of her sufferings; she who had been indulged in every luxury, who had been educated with the greatest care, was now lost for ever, an outcast from the society to which she could never hope to return, and associating with those she both dreaded and despised.  She passed her days and her nights in tears; and had soon more cause for sorrow from the brutal treatment she received from Osborne, who had been her destroyer.  Her child was her only solace; but for him, and the fear of leaving him to the demoralising influence of those about him, she would have laid down and died: but she lived for him--for him attempted to recall Osborne from his career of increasing guilt--bore meekly with reproaches and with blows.  At last Osborne changed his nefarious life for one of deeper guilt: he became a pirate, and still carried with him Cecilia and her child.  This was the climax of her misery: she now wasted from day to day, and grief would soon have terminated her existence, had it not been hastened by the cruelty of Cain, who, upon an expostulation on her part, followed up with a denunciation of the consequences of his guilty career, struck her with such violence that she sank under the blow.  She expired with a prayer that her child might be rescued from a life of guilt; and when the then repentant Cain promised what he never did perform, she blessed him, too, before she died.  Such was the substance of the narrative, as far as it related to the unfortunate mother of these two young men, who, when they had concluded, sat hand-in-hand in mournful silence.  This, however, was soon broken by the innumerable questions asked by Edward of his brother, as to what he could remember of their ill-fated parent, which were followed up by the history of Francisco's eventful life.  ""And the treasure, Edward,"" said Francisco; ""I cannot take possession of it.""  ""No, nor shall you either,"" replied Edward; ""it belongs to the captors, and must be shared as prize-money.  You will never touch one penny of it, but I shall, I trust, pocket a very fair proportion of it!  However, keep this paper, as it is addressed to you.""  The admiral had been made acquainted with all the particulars of the eventful trial, and had sent a message to Edward, requesting that, as soon as he and his brother could make it convenient, he would be happy to see them at the Penn, as well as the daughter of the Spanish governor, whom he must consider as being under his protection during the time that she remained at Port Royal.  This offer was gladly accepted by Clara; and on the second day after the trial they proceeded up to the Penn.  Clara and Francisco were introduced, and apartments and suitable attendance provided for the former.  ""Templemore,"" said the admiral, ""I'm afraid I must send you away to Porto Rico, to assure the governor of his daughter's safety.""  ""I would rather you would send some one else, sir, and I'll assure her happiness in the meantime.""  ""What! by marrying her?  Humph! you've a good opinion of yourself!  Wait till you're a captain, sir.""  ""I hope I shall not have to wait long, sir,"" replied Edward, demurely.  ""By-the-bye,"" said the admiral, ""did you not say you have notice of treasure concealed in those islands?""  ""My brother has: I have not.""  ""We must send for it.  I think we must send you, Edward.  Mr Francisco, you must go with him.""  ""With pleasure, sir,"" replied Francisco, laughing; ""but I think I'd rather wait till Edward is a captain.  His wife and his fortune ought to come together.  I think I shall not deliver up my papers until the day of his marriage!""  ""Upon my word,"" said Captain Manly, ""I wish, Templemore, you had your commission, for there seems so much depending on it--the young lady's happiness, my share of the prize-money, and the admiral's eighth. Really, admiral, it becomes a common cause; and I'm sure he deserves it!""  ""So do I, Manly,"" replied the admiral; ""and to prove that I have thought so here comes Mr Hadley with it in his hand; it only wants one little thing to complete it--""  ""Which is your signature, admiral, I presume,"" replied Captain Manly, taking a pen full of ink, and presenting it to his senior officer.  ""Exactly,"" replied the admiral, scribbling at the bottom of the paper; ""and now--it does not want that.  Captain Templemore, I wish you joy!""  Edward made a very low obeisance, as his flushed countenance indicated his satisfaction.  ""I cannot give commissions, admiral,"" said Francisco, presenting a paper in return; ""but I can give information--and you will find it not unimportant--for the treasure appears of great value.""  ""God bless my soul!  Manly, you must start at daylight!"" exclaimed the admiral; ""why, there is enough to load your sloop!  There!--read it!-- and then I will write your orders, and enclose a copy of it, for fear of accident.""  ""That was to have been my fortune,"" said Francisco, with a grave smile; ""but I would not touch it.""  ""Very right, boy!--a fine principle!  But we are not quite so particular,"" said the admiral.  ""Now, where's the young lady?  Let her know that dinner's on the table.""  A fortnight after this conversation, Captain Manly returned with the treasure; and the Enterprise, commanded by another officer, returned from Porto Rico, with a letter from the governor in reply to one from the admiral, in which the rescue of his daughter by Edward had been communicated.  The letter was full of thanks to the admiral, and compliments to Edward; and, what was of more importance, it sanctioned the union of the young officer with his daughter, with a dozen boxes of gold doubloons.  About six weeks after the above-mentioned important conversation, Mr Witherington, who had been reading a voluminous packet of letters in his breakfast-room in Finsbury Square, pulled his bell so violently that old Jonathan thought his master must be out of his senses.  This, however, did not induce him to accelerate his solemn and measured pace; and he made his appearance at the door, as usual, without speaking.  ""Why don't that fellow answer the bell?"" cried Mr Witherington.  ""I am here, sir,"" said Jonathan, solemnly.  ""Well, so you are! but, confound you! you come like the ghost of a butler!--But who do you think is coming here, Jonathan?""  ""I cannot tell, sir.""  ""But I can!--you solemn old!  Edward's coming here!--coming home directly?""  ""Is he to sleep in his old room, sir?"" replied the imperturbable butler.  ""No! the best bedroom!  Why, Jonathan, he is married--he is made a captain--Captain Templemore!""  ""Yes--sir.""  ""And he has found his brother, Jonathan; his twin-brother!""  ""Yes--sir.""  ""His brother Francis--that was supposed to be lost!  But it's a long story, Jonathan--and a very wonderful one! his poor mother has long been dead!""  ""In caelo quies!"" said Jonathan, casting up his eyes.  ""But his brother has turned up again.""  ""Resurgam!"" said the butler.  ""They will be here in ten days--so let everything be in readiness, Jonathan.  God bless my soul!"" continued the old gentleman, ""I hardly know what I'm about.  It's a Spanish girl, Jonathan!""  ""What is, sir?""  ""What is, sir!--who, Captain Templemore's wife; and he was tried as a pirate!""  ""Who, sir?""  ""Who sir! why, Francis, his brother!  Jonathan, you're a stupid old fellow!""  ""Have you any further commands, sir?""  ""No--no!--there--that'll do--go away.""  And in three weeks after this conversation, Captain and Mrs Templemore, and his brother Frank, were established in the house, to the great delight of Mr Witherington; for he had long been tired of solitude and old Jonathan.  The twin-brothers were a comfort to him in his old age: they closed his eyes in peace--they divided his blessing and his large fortune and thus ends our history of THE PIRATE!","Fiction, Adventure, Historical","Sir Walter Scott's 'The Pirate' is set in the early 18th century on the remote islands of Shetland and Orkney.

THE DARK TOWER     PART I     CHAPTER I   Winn Staines respected God, the royal family, and his regiment; but even his respect for these three things was in many ways academic: he respected nothing else.  His father, Admiral Sir Peter Staines, had never respected anything; he went to church, however, because his wife didn't. They were that kind of family.  Lady Staines had had twelve children. Seven of them died as promptly as their constitutions allowed; the five survivors, shouted at, quarreled over, and soundly thrashed, tore themselves through a violent childhood into a rackety youth. They were never vicious, for they never reflected over or considered anything that they did.  Winn got drunk occasionally, assaulted policemen frequently, and could carry a small pony under each arm. Charles and James, who were in the navy, followed in the footsteps of Sir Peter; that is to say, they explored all possible accidents on sea or ashore, and sought for a fight as if it were a mislaid crown jewel.  Dolores and Isabella had to content themselves with minor feats and to be known merely as the terrors of the neighborhood, though ultimately Dolores succeeded in making a handsome splash by running away with a prize-fighting groom. She made him an excellent wife, and though Lady Staines never mentioned her name again, it was rumored that Sir Peter met her surreptitiously at Tattersall's and took her advice upon his horses.  Isabella, shocked and outraged by this sisterly mischance, married, in the face of all probability, a reluctant curate. He subsided into a family living given to him by Sir Peter, and tried to die of consumption.  Isabella took entire control of the parish, which she ruled as if it were a quarter-deck. She did not use her father's language, but she inherited his voice. It rang over boys' clubs and into mothers' meetings with the penetration and volume of a megaphone.  Lady Staines heartily disliked both her daughters, and she appeared not to care very deeply for her sons, but of the three she had a decided preference for Winn. Winn had a wicked temper, an unshakable nerve, and had inherited the strength of Sir Peter's muscles and the sledge-hammer weight of Lady Staines's wit. He had been expelled from his private school for unparalleled insolence to the head master; a repetition of his summing up of that gentleman's life and conduct delighted his mother, though she assisted Sir Peter in thrashing him for the result.  It may have contributed to his mother's affection for him that Winn had left England at nineteen, and had reached thirty-five with only two small intervals at home.  His first leave had kept them all busy with what the Staines considered a wholly unprovoked lawsuit; a man whom Winn had most unfortunately felt it his duty to fling from a bus into the street, having the weak-minded debility to break his leg had the further audacity to claim enormous damages. The Staines fought the case _en bloc_ with splendid zeal, and fiery eloquence. It would probably have resulted better for their interests if they had not defied their own counsel, outraged the respectable minds of the jury, and insulted the learned judge. Under these circumstances they lost their case, and the rest of Winn's leave was taken up in the Family's congenial pursuit of laying the blame on each other.  The second and more fatal visit heralded Winn's marriage. He had not had time to marry before. It would not be true to say that women had played no part in his experiences, but the part they had played was neither exalted nor durable. They figured in his imagination as an inferior type of game, tiresome when captured. His life had been spent mainly in pursuit of larger objects. He had been sent straight from Sandhurst to South Africa, where he had fought with violence and satisfaction for two years, winning the D. S. O., a broken nose, and a cut across the face. When the fighting was over, he obtained leave for a two-years' exploring expedition into the heart of West Africa. Ten men had gone on this expedition, and two survived. Winn never talked of these experiences, but he once admitted to a friend that the early study of his sisters' characters had saved him in many awkward moments. He had known how to appeal to female savages with the unerring touch of experience.  From West Africa he was called to the Indian frontier, where he put in seven years in variegated and extremely useful service. He received his majority early, and disappeared for two years into Tibet, Manchuria, and China. After that he came back to England for polo, and met Estelle Fanshawe. She was lovely, gentle, intensely vain, and not very truthful.  Lady Staines disposed of her at once as ""a mincing ninny."" The phrase aggravated Winn, and his fancy deepened. It was stimulated by the fact that Estelle was the belle of the neighborhood and had a large supply of ardent admirers. It was almost like running a race with the odds against you. Winn was not a conceited man, and perhaps he thought the odds more against him than they actually were. He was the second son of a man who was immensely rich, (though Sir Peter was reported stingy to his children). Everybody knew who the Staines were, while the Fanshawes after every effort and with nearly every attraction had not become a part of public knowledge. Besides, Estelle had been made love to for some time, and Winn's way was undeniably different from that of her other admirers.  He met her at a dance, and insisted upon dancing with her the whole evening. He took her card away from her, and scored off all her indignant partners. In the interval of these decisive actions he made love to her in a steady, definite way that was difficult to laugh at and impossible to turn aside.  When he said good-night to her he told her that he would probably come and see her soon. She went away in a flutter, for his words, though casual, had had a sharply significant sound; besides, he had very nearly kissed her; if she had been more truthful, she would have said quite.  She didn't, in thinking it over, know at all how this had happened, and she generally knew precisely how these things happened.  Lady Staines told her son at breakfast a few mornings later what she thought of Miss Fanshawe.  ""She's a girl,"" she observed, knocking the top off her egg, ""who will develop into a nervous invalid or an advanced coquette, and it entirely depends upon how much admiration she gets which she does. I hear she's religious, too, in a silly, egotistical way. She ought to have her neck wrung.""  Sir Peter disagreed; they heard him in the servants' hall.  ""Certainly not!"" he roared; ""certainly not! I don't think so at all! The girl's a damned pretty piece, and the man's one of my best tenants. He's only just come, and he's done wonders to the place already. And I won't have the boy crabbed for fancying a neighbor! It's very natural he should. You never have a woman in the house fit to look at. Who the devil do you expect your boys to marry? Negresses or bar-maids?""  ""Gentlewomen,"" said Lady Staines, firmly, ""unless their father's behavior prevents them from being accepted.""  Winn said nothing. He got up and began cutting ham at the sideboard. His mother hesitated a moment; but as she had only roused one of her men, she made a further effort in the direction of the other.  ""The girl's a mean-spirited little liar,"" she observed. ""I wouldn't take her as a housemaid.""  ""You may have to take her as a daughter-in-law, though,"" Winn remarked without turning round from the sideboard.  [Illustration: ""You may have to take her as a daughter-in-law, though,"" Winn remarked without turning round from the sideboard]  Sir Peter grunted. He didn't like this at all, but he couldn't very well say so without appearing to agree with his wife, a thing he had carefully avoided doing for thirty years.  Lady Staines rose and gathered up her letters.  ""You're of age,"" she said to her son, ""and you've had about as much experience of civilized women as a European baby has of crocodiles, and you'll be just about as safe and clever with them. As for you, Peter, pray don't trouble to tell me what you think of the Fanshawes in a year's time. You've never had a tenant you haven't had a lawsuit with yet, and this time you'll be adding Winn's divorce proceedings to your other troubles. I should think you might begin to save toward the damages now.""  Sir Peter's oaths accompanied his wife across the dining-room to the door, which her son opened ceremoniously for her. Their eyes crossed like swords.  ""If I get that girl, you'll be nice to her,"" Winn said in a low voice.  ""As long as you are,"" replied Lady Staines, with a grim smile. He did not bang the door after her, as she had hoped; instead, he went to see the girl.     CHAPTER II   It was eleven o'clock when Winn arrived at the Fanshawes. Estelle was barely dressed, she always slept late, had her breakfast in bed, and gave as much trouble as possible to the servants.  However, when she heard who had called to see her, she sent for a basket and some roses, and five minutes later strolled into the drawing-room, with her hat on, and the flowers in her hands.  Her mother stayed in the garden and nervously thought out the lunch.  Winn seized the basket out of Estelle's hands, took her by the wrists, and drew her to the window.  She wasn't frightened of him, but she pretended to be. She said, ""Oh, Major Staines!"" She looked as soft and innocent as a cream-fed kitten. Winn cleared his throat. It made him feel rather religious to look at her. He did not of course see her as a kitten; he saw her approximately as an angel.  ""Look here,"" he said, ""my name's Winn.""  ""You're hurting my wrists,"" she murmured. He dropped them. ""Winn,"" she said under her breath.  ""I say,"" he said after a moment's pause, ""would you mind marrying me?""  Estelle lifted her fine China blue eyes to his. They weren't soft, but they could sometimes look very mysterious.  ""Oh,"" she said, ""but, Winn--it's so sudden--so soon!""  ""Leave's short,"" Winn explained, ""and besides, I knew the moment I looked at you, I wanted you. I don't know how you feel, of course; but--well--I'm sure you aren't the kind of girl to let a fellow kiss you, are you, and mean nothing?""  Estelle's long lashes swept her cheeks; she behaved exquisitely. She was, of course, exactly that kind of girl.  ""Ah,"" she said, with a little tremble in her voice, ""if I do marry you--will you be kind to me?""  Winn trembled, too; he flushed very red, and suddenly he did the funniest, most unlikely thing in the world: he got down on his knees beside her, and taking both her hands in his, he kissed them.  ""I'll be like this as much as ever you'll let me,"" he said gravely.  He had a great craving for sweetness, delicacy, and gentleness; he began to tell her in little short, abrupt sentences how unworthy he was of her, not fit to touch her really--he was afraid he'd been horribly rough--and done lots of things she would have hated (he forgot to mention that he'd ever done anything worth doing as well); he explained that he didn't know any women a bit like her; there weren't any, of course, _really_ like--but she knew what he meant. So that he expected she'd have to teach him a lot--would she--if she didn't mind, and overlook his being stupid?  Estelle listened thoughtfully for a few minutes, then she asked him if he didn't think eight bridesmaids would be better than four?  He got up from his knees then.  He didn't like discussing the wedding, and he got bored very soon and went away, so that Mrs. Fanshawe didn't need to have the special lunch she had ordered, after all.  They were to have a very short engagement, and Estelle decided on four bridesmaids and four pages; she was so small herself that children would look prettier and more innocent.  There was something particularly charming about a young wedding, and they were to have a celebration first--Estelle was most particular about that--and a wedding breakfast afterwards of course. Winn was extraordinarily kind to her; he let her settle everything she liked and gave her exactly the ring she wanted--an immense emerald set with diamonds. He wasn't in the least particular about where they spent the honeymoon, after making a very silly suggestion, which Estelle promptly over-ruled, that they might go to the East Coast and make a study of fortifications.  He agreed that London would do just as well, with theaters, and he could look up a man he knew at the War Office. Certainly they should go to the Ritz if Estelle liked it; but it was rather noisy.  The one point he did make was to have a young officer he liked, who had been with him in China, Lionel Drummond, as his best man, instead of his cousin Lord Arlington. His brothers were out of the question, as he couldn't have one without having a row with the other. Estelle wanted Lord Arlington, but when she pressed the point, Winn gave her a most extraordinary sharp look and said, ""I thought I told you I wanted that boy Drummond?"" It was a most peculiar and disconcerting look, well known in the Staines family. Trouble usually followed very quickly upon its heels. Estelle shivered and gave in and was rewarded by a diamond brooch.  This showed her how important shivering was going to be in her married life.  The only really disagreeable time Estelle had during her engagement was the short half hour in which Lady Staines fulfilled her maternal duties.  It was a rainy day and Lady Staines had walked two miles across the fields in what looked like a cricket cap, and a waterproof.  She cleaned her boots as carefully as she could in the hall. They were square-toed and hob-nailed and most unsuitable for a drawing-room.  Mrs. Fanshawe literally quailed before them. ""You shouldn't have parquet floors,"" Lady Staines remarked, holding out her hand; ""in the country, it's the ruin of them unless you wear paper soles,"" she glanced searchingly at Mrs. Fanshawe's and Estelle's feet. ""And that of course is the ruin of your feet. Probably you've lived in London all your lives?""  Mrs. Fanshawe found herself in the position of apologizing for what had hitherto been her proudest boast. Lady Staines looked tolerantly around her. ""London's a poor place,"" she observed, ""and very shoddy. When my friends the Malverns lived here, they had old oak and rather nice chintzes. I see you go in for color schemes and nicknacks. I hope Estelle won't find Staines uncomfortable; however, she probably won't be with us often.""  She turned to her future daughter-in-law. ""You are Estelle, my dear, ain't you?"" she demanded. ""And I dare say you can't speak a word of French in spite of your fine name. Can you?""  Estelle hesitated and blushed. ""Not very much, I'm afraid,"" she truthfully murmured. It flashed through her mind that with Lady Staines you must be truthful if there was any possible chance of your being found out.  ""Hum!"" said Lady Staines thoughtfully. ""I can't see what people spend so much on education for nowadays. I really can't! And you're going to marry my second son, ain't you?"" she demanded. ""Well, I'm sure it's very kind of you. All the Staines have tempers, but Winn's is quite the worst. I don't want to exaggerate, but I really don't think you could match it in this world. He generally keeps it, too! He was a nasty, murderous, little boy. I assure you I've often beaten him till he was black and blue and never got a word out of him.""  Mrs. Fanshawe looked horrified. ""But my dear Lady Staines,"" she urged, ""surely you tried kindness?""  Lady Staines shook her head. ""No,"" she said, ""I don't think so, I don't think I am kind--very. But he's turned out well, don't you think? He's the only one of my sons who's got honors--a 'D.S.O.' for South Africa, and a C.B. for something or other, I never know what, in China; and he got his Majority extraordinarily young for special services--or he wouldn't have been able to marry you, my dear, for his father won't help him. He doesn't get drunk as often as the other two boys, either; in fact, on the whole, I should call him satisfactory. And now he's chosen you, and I'm sure we're all very grateful to you for taking him in hand.""  Mrs. Fanshawe offered her visitor tea; she was profoundly shocked, but she thought that tea would help. Lady Staines refused it. ""No, thank you very much,"" she said. ""I must be getting back to give Sir Peter his. I shall be late as it is, and I shall probably hear him swearing all down the drive. We shall all be seeing more than enough of each other before long. But there's no use making a fuss about it, is there? We're a most disagreeable family, and I'm sure it'll be worse for you than for us.""  Estelle accompanied her future mother-in-law to the door. She had not been as much shocked as her mother.  Lady Staines laid her small neat hand on the girl's arm. She looked at her very hard, but there was a spark of some kind, behind the hardness; if the eyes hadn't been those of Lady Staines, they might almost have been said to plead.  ""I wonder if you like him?"" she said slowly.  Estelle said, ""Oh, dear Lady Staines, believe me--with all my heart!""  Lady Staines didn't believe her, but she smiled good-humoredly. ""Yes, yes, my dear, I know!"" she said. ""But how much heart have you got? You see his happiness and yours depend on that. The woman who marries a Staines ought to have a good deal of heart and all of it ought to be his.""  Estelle put on an air of pretty dignity. ""I have never loved any one before,"" she asserted with serene untruthfulness (she felt sure this fact couldn't be proved against her), ""and Winn believes in my heart.""  ""Does he?"" said his mother. ""I wonder. He believes in your pretty face! Well, it is pretty, I acknowledge that. Keep it as pretty as you can.""  She didn't kiss her future daughter-in-law, but she tapped her lightly on the shoulder and trudged back with head erect through the rain.  ""It's a bad business,"" she said to herself thoughtfully. ""He's rushed his fence and there's a ditch on the other side of it, deep enough to drown him!""     CHAPTER III   Winn wanted, if possible, a home without rows. He knew very little of homes, and nothing which had made him suppose this ideal likely to be realized.  Still he went on having it, hiding it, and hoping for it.  Once he had come across it. It was the time when he had decided to undertake a mission to Tibet without a government mandate. He wanted young Drummond to go with him. The job was an awkward and dangerous one. Certain authorities had warned Winn that though, if the results were satisfactory, it would certainly be counted in his favor, should anything go wrong no help could be sent to him, and he would be held personally responsible; that is he would be held responsible if he were not dead, which was the most likely outcome of the whole business.  It is easy to test a man on the Indian frontier, and Winn had had his eye on Lionel Drummond for two years. He was a cool-headed, reliable boy, and in some occult and wholly unexpressed way Winn was conscious that he was strongly drawn to him. Winn offered him the job, and even consented, when he was on leave, to visit the Drummonds and talk the matter over with the boy's parents. It was then that he discovered that people really could have a quiet home.  Mrs. Drummond was a woman of a great deal of character, very great gentleness, and equal courage. She neither cried nor made fusses, and no one could even have imagined her making a noise.  It was she who virtually settled, after a private talk with Winn, that Lionel might accompany him. The extraordinary thing that Mrs. Drummond said to Winn was, ""You see, I feel quite sure that you'll look after Lionel, whatever happens.""  Winn had replied coldly, ""I should never dream of taking a man who couldn't look after himself.""  Mrs. Drummond said nothing. She just smiled at Winn as if he had agreed that he would look after Lionel. General Drummond was non-committal. He knew the boy would get on without the mission, but he also seemed to be influenced by some absurd idea that Winn was to be indefinitely trusted, so that he would say nothing to stop them. Lionel himself was wild with delight, and the whole affair was managed without suspicion, resentment, or hostility.  The expedition was quite as hard as the authorities had intimated, and at one point it very nearly proved fatal. A bad attack of dysentery and snow blindness brought Lionel down at a very inconvenient spot, crossing the mountains of Tibet during a blizzard. The rest of the party said with some truth that they must go forward or perish. Winn sent them on to the next settlement, keeping back a few stores and plenty of cartridges. He said that he would rejoin them with Drummond when Drummond was better, and if he did not arrive before a certain date they were to push on without him.  They were alone together for six weeks, and during these six weeks Winn discovered that he was quite a new kind of person; for one thing he developed into a first-rate nurse, and he could be just like a mother, and say the silliest, gentlest things. No one was there to see or hear him, and the boy was so ill that he wouldn't be likely to remember afterwards. He did remember, however, he remembered all his life. The stores ran out and they were dependent on Winn's rifle for food. They melted snow water to drink, and there were days when their chances looked practically invisible.  Somehow or other they got out of it, the boy grew better, the weather improved, and Winn managed, though the exact means were never specified, to drag Lionel on a sledge to the nearest settlement, where the rest of the party were still awaiting them.  After that the expedition was successful and the friendship between the two men final. Winn didn't like to think what Mrs. Drummond would say to him when they got back to England, but she let him down quite easily; she gave him no thanks, she only looked at him with Lionel's steady eyes and said, smiling a little, ""I always knew you'd bring him back to me.""  Winn did not ask Lionel to stay at Staines Court until the wedding. None of the Staines went in much for making friends, and he didn't want his mother to see that he was fond of any one.  The night before the wedding, however, Lionel arrived in the midst of an altercation as to who had ordered the motor to meet the wrong train.  This lasted a long time because all the Staines, except Dolores, were gathered together, and it expanded unexpectedly into an attack on Charles, the eldest son, whose name had been coupled with that of a lady whose professional aptitudes were described as those of a manicurist. There was a moment when murder of a particularly atrocious and internecine character seemed the only possible outcome to the discussion--then Charles in a white fury found the door.  Before he had gone out of earshot Sir Peter asked Lionel what his father would do if presented with a possible daughter-in-law so markedly frail? Sir Peter seemed to be laboring under the delusion that he had been weakly favorable to his son's inclinations, and that any other father would have expressed himself more forcibly. Lionel was saved from the awkwardness of disagreeing with him by an unexpected remark from Lady Staines.  ""A girl from some kind of a chemist's shop,"" she observed musingly. ""I fancy she's too good for Charles.""  Sir Peter, who was fond of Charles, said the girl was probably not from a chemist's shop; and described to the horror of the butler, who had entered to prepare the tea-table, just what kind of a place she probably was from.  Lady Staines looked at Winn, and said she didn't see that it was much worse to marry a manicure girl than one who looked like a manequin. They were neither of them types likely to do credit to the family. Winn replied that, as far as that went, bad clothes and good morals did not always go together. He was prepared apparently with an apt illustration, when Isabella's husband, the Rev. Mr. Betchley, asked feebly if he might go up-stairs to rest.  It was quite obvious to everybody that he needed it.  The next morning at breakfast the manicure girl was again discussed, but in a veiled way so as not really to upset Charles before the wedding.  Winn escaped immediately afterwards with Lionel. They went for a walk, most of which was conducted in silence; finally, however, they found a log, took out their pipes, and made themselves comfortable.  Lionel said, ""I wish I'd seen Miss Fanshawe; it must be awfully jolly for you, Winn.""  Winn was silent for a minute or two, then he began, slowly gathering impetus as he went on: ""Well--yes, of course, in a sense it is. I mean, I know I'm awfully lucky and all that, only--you see, old chap, I'm frightfully ignorant of women. I know one sort of course--a jolly sight better than you do--but girls! Hang it all, I don't know girls. That's what worries me--she's such a little thing."" He paused a moment. ""I hope it's all right,"" he said, ""marrying her. It seems pretty rough on them sometimes, I think--don't you--I fancy she's delicate and all that."" Lionel nodded. ""It does seem rather beastly,"" he admitted, ""their having to have a hard time, I mean--but if they care for you--I suppose it works out all right."" Winn paid no attention to this fruitless optimism. He went on with his study of Estelle. ""She's--she's religious too, you know, that's why we're to have that other service first. Rather nice idea, I think, don't you, what? Makes it a bit of a strain for her though I'm afraid, but she'd never think of that. I'm sure she's plucky."" Lionel also was quite sure Estelle must be plucky.  ""Fancy you getting married,"" Lionel said suddenly. ""I can't see it somehow.""  ""I feel it funny myself,"" Winn admitted. ""You see, it's so damned long, and I never have seen much of women. I hope she won't expect me to talk a lot or anything of that kind. Her people, you know, chatter like so many magpies--just oozes out of 'em.""  ""We must be off,"" Lionel said.  They stood up, knocked the ashes out of their pipes, and prepared to walk on.  It was a mild June day, small vague hills stretched behind them, and before them soft, lawn-like fields fell away to the river's edge.  Everywhere the green of trees in a hundred tones of color and with delicate, innumerable leaf shadows, laid upon the landscape, the fragrance and lightness of the spring.  They were in a temperate land, every yard of it was cultivated and civilized, immensely lived on and understood. None of it had been neglected or was dangerous or strange to the eye of man.  Simultaneously the thought flashed between them of other lands and of sharper vicissitudes; they saw again bleak passes which were cruel death traps, and above them untrodden alien heights; they felt the solemn vastness of the interminable, flawless snows. They kept their eyes away from each other--but they knew what each other was feeling, adventure and danger were calling to them--the old sting and thrill of an unending trail; and then from a little hollow in the guarded hills rang out the wedding bells.  Lionel looked a little shyly at his chief. ""I wonder,"" he said, as Winn made no response, ""if we can ever do things--things together again, I mean--I should like to think we could."" Winn gave him a quick look and moved hastily ahead over the field path toward the church. ""Why the devil shouldn't we?"" he threw back at Lionel over his shoulder.     CHAPTER IV   Estelle's wedding was a great success, but this was not surprising when one realized how many years had been spent in preparation for it. Estelle was only twenty-three, but for the last ten years she had known that she would marry, and she had thought out every detail of the ceremony except the bridegroom. You could have any kind of a bridegroom--men were essentially imperfect--but you need have only one kind of ceremony, and that could be ideal.  Estelle had visualized everything from the last pot of lilies--always Annunciation ones, not Arum, which look pagan--at the altar to the red cloth at the door. There were to be rose-leaves instead of rice; the wedding was to be in June, with a tent in the garden and strawberries.  If possible, she would be married by a bishop; if not, by a dean. The bishop having proved too remote, the dean had to do. But he was a fine-looking man, and would be made a bishop soon, so Estelle did not really mind. The great thing was to have gaiters on the lawn afterward.  The day was perfect. Estelle woke at her usual hour in the morning, her heart was beating a little faster than it generally did, and then she remembered with a pang of joy the perfect fit of her wedding-gown hanging in the wardrobe. She murmured to herself:  ""One love, one life."" She was not thinking of Winn, but she had always meant to say that on her wedding morning.  Then she had early tea. Her mother came in and kissed her, and Estelle implored her not to fuss, and above all not to get red in the face before going to church, where she was to wear a mauve hat.  It was difficult for Mrs. Fanshawe not to fuss, Estelle was the most expensive of her children and in a way the most important; for if she wasn't pleased it was always so dreadful. There were half a dozen younger children and any of them might do something tiresome.  Estelle arrived at the church five minutes late, on her father's arm, followed by four little bridesmaids in pink and white, and four little pages in blue and white. The effect was charming.  The village church was comfortably full, and with her eyes modestly cast down Estelle managed to see that all the right people were there, including the clergyman's daughters, whom she had always hated.  The Fanshawes and her mother's relations the Arnots had come down from town. They all looked very prosperous people with good dressmakers and tailors, and most of them had given her handsome silver wedding presents or checks.  They were on one side of the church just as Estelle had always pictured them, and on the other were the Staines and their relations. The Staines had very few friends, and those they had were hard riding, hunting people, who never look their best in satin. There was no doubt that the Staines sitting in the front seat were a blot on the whole affair.  You couldn't tell everybody that they were a county family, and they didn't look like it. They were too large and coarse, and took up far too much room. There they sat, six big creatures in one pew, all restless, all with big chins, hard eyes, jutting eyebrows, and a dreadful look as if they were buccaneering. As a matter of fact they all felt rather timid and flat, and meant to behave beautifully, though Sir Peter needn't have blown his nose like a trumpet and stamped simultaneously just as Estelle entered.  At the top of the aisle Winn waited for his bride; and his boots were dusty. Standing behind him was the handsomest man that Estelle had ever seen; and not only that, but the very kind of man she had always wished to see. It made Estelle feel for a moment like a good housekeeper, who has not been told that a distinguished guest was coming to dinner. If she had known, she would have ordered something different. She felt in a flash that he was the kind of bridegroom who would have suited the ceremony.  He was several inches taller than Winn, slim, with a small athletic head and perfectly cut Greek features; his face would have been a shade too regular and too handsome if he had not had the very same hard-bitten look in his young gray eyes that Winn had in his bright, hawk-like brown ones. Lionel was looking at Estelle as she came up the aisle in a tender, protective, admiring way, as if she were a very beautiful flower. This was most satisfactory, but at least Winn might have done the same. Instead of looking as if he were waiting for his bride, he looked exactly as if he were holding a narrow pass against an enemy. His very figure had a peculiarly stern and rock-like expression. His broad shoulders were set, his rather heavy head erect, and when he did look at Estelle, it was an inconceivably sharp look as if he were trying to see through her.  She didn't know, of course, that on his way to church he had thought every little white cloud in the blue sky was like her, and every lily in a cottage garden. There was a drop of sardonic blood in him, that made him challenge her even at the moment of achieved surrender.  ""By Jove,"" he thought to himself, ""can she be as beautiful as she looks?""  Then the service began, and they had the celebration first, and afterward the usual ceremony, perfectly conducted, and including the rather over-exercised ""Voice that Breathed o'er Eden."" The dean gave them an excellent, short and evasive address about their married duties, a great deal nicer than anything in the Prayer Book, and the March from Lohengrin took them to the vestry. In the vestry Winn began to be tiresome. The vicar said:  ""Kiss the bride,"" and Winn replied:  ""No, thanks; not at present,"" looking like a stone wall, and sticking his hands in his pockets. The vicar, who had known him from a boy, did not press the point; but of course the dean looked surprised. Any dean would.  The reception afterwards would have been perfect but for the Staines, who tramped through everything. Estelle perpetually saw them bursting into places where they weren't wanted, and shouting remarks which sounded abusive but were meant to be cordial to cowering Fanshawes and Arnots. It was really not necessary for Sir Peter to say in the middle of the lawn that what Mr. Fanshawe wanted was more manure.  It seemed to Estelle that wherever she went she heard Sir Peter's resonant voice talking about manure.  Lady Staines was much quieter; still she needn't have remarked to Estelle's mother, ""Well--I'm glad to see you have seven children, _that_ looks promising at any rate."" It made two unmarried ladies of uncertain age walk into a flower-bed.  Winn behaved abominably. He took the youngest Fanshawe child and disappeared with him into the stable yard.  Even Charles and James behaved better than that. They hurled well-chosen incomprehensible jokes at the clergyman's daughters--dreadful girls who played hockey and had known the Staines all their lives--and these ladies returned their missiles with interest.  It caused a good deal of noise, but it sounded hearty.  Isabella, being a clergyman's wife, talked to the Dean, who soon looked more astonished than ever.  At last it was all comfortably over. Estelle, leaning on her father's arm in pale blue, kissed her mother. Mrs. Fanshawe looked at the end rather tactlessly cheerful. (She had cried throughout the ceremony, just when she had worn the mauve hat and Estelle had hoped she wouldn't.)  Mr. Fanshawe behaved much more suitably; he said to Winn with a trembling voice, ""Take care of my little girl,"" and Winn, who might have said something graceful in reply, merely shook his father-in-law's hand with such force that Mr. Fanshawe, red with pain, hastily retreated.  Lionel Drummond was charming and much appreciated everywhere; he retrieved Winn from the stable yard when no one could guess where he was, and was the first person to call Estelle, Mrs. Staines; he wound up the affair with a white satin slipper.  When they drove off, Estelle turned toward Winn with shining eyes and quivering lips. It was the moment for a judicious amount of love-making, and all Winn said was:  ""Look here, you know, those high-heeled things on your feet are absolutely murderous. They might give you a bad tumble. Don't let me see you in 'em again. Are you sure you're quite comfortable, and all that?""  He made the same absurd fuss about Estelle's comfort in the railway carriage; but it was one of the last occasions on which he did it, because he discovered almost immediately that however many things you could think of for Estelle's comfort, she could think of more for herself, and no matter how much care or attention was lavished upon her, it could never quite equal her unerring instinct for her own requirements.  After this he was prepared to be ardent, but Estelle didn't care for ardor in a railway train, so she soon stopped it. One of the funny things she discovered about Winn was that it was the easiest possible thing to stop his ardor, and this was really odd, because it was not from lack of strength in his emotion. She never quite discovered what it did come from, because it didn't occur to her that Winn would very much rather have died than offend or tire the woman he loved.  She thought that Winn was rather coarse, but he wasn't as coarse as that!  Estelle had a great deal that she wanted to talk over about the wedding. The whole occasion flamed out at her--a perfect project, perfectly carried out. She explained to Winn at length who everybody was and how there had been some people there who had had to be taken down, and others who had had to be pushed forward, and her mother explained to, and her father checked, and the children (it was too dreadful how they'd let Bobby run after Winn), kept as much out of the way as possible.  Winn listened hard and tried to follow intelligently all the family histories she evolved for him. At last after a rather prolonged pause on his part, just at a point when he should have expressed admiration of her guidance of a delicate affair, Estelle glanced at him and discovered that he was asleep! They hadn't been married for three hours, and he could go to sleep in the middle of their first real talk! She was sure Lionel Drummond wouldn't have done any such thing. But Winn was old--he was thirty-five--and she could see quite plainly now that the hair round the tops of his ears was gray. She looked at him scornfully, but he didn't wake up.  When he woke up he laughed.  ""By Jove!"" he exclaimed, ""I believe I've been to sleep!"" but he didn't apologize. He began instead to tell her some things that might interest her, about what Drummond, his best man, and he, had done in Manchuria, just as if nothing had happened; but naturally Estelle wouldn't be interested. She was first polite, then bored, then captious. Winn looked at her rather hard. ""Are you trying to pay me back for falling asleep?"" he asked with a queer little laugh. ""Is that what you're up to?"" Estelle stiffened.  ""Certainly not,"" she said. ""I simply wasn't very interested. I don't think I like Chinese stories, and Manchuria is just the same, of course.""  Winn leaned over her, with a wicked light in his eyes, like a naughty school boy. ""Own up!"" he said, laying his rough hand very gently on her shoulder. ""Own up, old lady!""  But has anybody ever owned up when they were being spiteful?  Estelle didn't. She looked at Winn's hand till he withdrew it, and then she remarked that she was feeling faint from want of food.  After she had had seven chicken sandwiches, pate de foie gras, half a melon, and some champagne, she began to be agreeable.  Winn was delighted at this change in her and quite inclined to think that their little ""breeze"" had been entirely due to his own awkwardness. Still, he wished she had owned up.     CHAPTER V   It took Winn a month to realize that he had paid his money, had his shy, and knocked down an empty cocoanut.  He couldn't get his money back, and he must spend the rest of his life carrying the cocoanut about with him.  It never occurred to him to shirk the institution of marriage. The church, the law, and the army stood in his mind for good, indelible things. Estelle was his wife as much as his handkerchief was his handkerchief. This meant that they were to be faithful to each other, go out to dinner together, and that he was to pay her bills. He knew the great thing in any tight corner was never under any circumstances to let go. All the dangers he had ever been in, had yielded, only because he hadn't.  It was true he had not been married before, but the same rule no doubt held good of marriage. If he held on to it, something more bearable would come of it. Then one could be out of the house a good deal, and there was the regiment. He began to see his way through marriage as a man sees his way through a gap in an awkward fence. The unfortunate part of it was that he couldn't get through the gap unless Estelle shared his insight.  He would have liked to put it to her, but he didn't know how; he never had had a great gift of expression, and something had brought him up very short in his communications with his wife.  It was so slight a thing that Estelle herself had forgotten all about it, but to a Staines it was absolutely final. She had told the gardener that Winn wanted hyacinths planted in the front bed. Winn hadn't wanted a garden at all, and he had let her have her way in everything else; but he had said quite plainly that he wouldn't on any account have hyacinths. The expression he used about them was excessively coarse, and it certainly should have remained in Estelle's memory. He had said, that the bally things stank. Nevertheless, Estelle had told the gardener that the master wanted hyacinths, and the gardener had told Winn. Winn gazed at the gardener in a way which made him wish that he had never been a gardener, but had taken up any other profession in which he was unlikely to meet a glance so ""nasty."" Then Winn said quietly:  ""You are perfectly sure, Parsons, that Mrs. Staines told you it was _my_ wish to have the hyacinths?"" And the gardener had said:  ""Yes, sir. She _did_ say, sir, as 'ow you 'ad a particler fancy for them."" And Winn had gone into the house and asked Estelle what the devil she meant? Estelle immediately denied the hyacinths and the gardener. People like that, she said, always misunderstand what one said to them.  ""Very well, then,"" Winn replied. ""He has lied to me, and must go. I'll dismiss him at once. He told me distinctly that you had said I liked them.""  Estelle fidgeted. She didn't want the gardener to go. She really couldn't remember what she'd said and what she hadn't said to him. And Winn was absurd, and how could it matter, and the people next door had hyacinths, and they'd always had them at home!  Winn listened in silence. He didn't say anything more about the gardener having lied, and he didn't countermand the hyacinths; only from that moment he ceased to believe a single word his wife said to him. This is discouraging to conversation and was very unfair to Estelle; for she might have told the truth more often if she had not discovered that it made no difference to her husband whether she told it to him or not.  Estelle knew that her heart was broken, but on the whole she did not find that she was greatly inconvenienced.  In an unhappy marriage the woman generally scores unless she is in love with her husband. Estelle never had been in love with Winn; she had had an agreeable feeling about him, and now she had a disagreeable feeling about him, but neither of these emotions could be compared with beaten-brass hot-water jugs, which she had always meant to have when she was married.  If Winn had remained deeply in love with her, besides making things more comfortable at meals it would have been a feather in her cap. Still his cruelty could be turned into another almost more becoming feather.  She said to herself and a little later to the nearest clergyman, ""I must make an offering of my sorrow."" She offered it a good deal, almost to every person she met. Even the cook was aware of it; but, like all servants, she unhesitatingly sided with the master. He might be in the wrong, but he was seldom if ever in the kitchen.  They had to have a house and servants, because Estelle felt that marriage without a house was hardly legal; and Winn had given way about it, as he was apt to do about things Estelle wanted. His very cruelty made him particularly generous about money.  But Estelle was never for a moment taken in by his generosity; she saw that it was his way of getting out of being in love with her. Winn was a bad man and had ruined her life--this forced her to supplement her trousseau.  Later on when he put down one of his hunters and sold a polo pony so that she could have a maid, she began to wonder if she had at all found out how bad he really was?  There was one point he never yielded; he firmly intended to rejoin his regiment in March.  The station to which they would have to go was five thousand feet up, lonely, healthy, and quite unfashionable. Winn had tried to make it seem jolly to her and had mentioned as a recommendation apparently that it was the kind of place in which you needn't wear gloves. It was close to the border, and women had to be a little careful where they rode.  Estelle had every intention of being careful; she would, she thought, be too careful ever to go to the Indian frontier at all. She had often heard of the tragic separations of Anglo-Indian marriages; it was true that they were generally caused by illness and children, but there must be other methods of obtaining the same immunities.  She had never had any difficulty with the doctor at home; she relied on him entirely, and he had invariably ordered her what she wanted, after a nice quiet talk.  Travers, the regimental doctor, was different, he looked exactly like a vet, and only understood things you had actually broken. Still Estelle put her trust in Providence; no self-respecting higher Power could wish a woman of her type to be wasted on a hill station. Something would happen to help her, and if not, she would be given grace to help herself.  One day Winn came down to breakfast with a particularly disagreeable expression. He said ""good-morning"" into his newspaper as usual without noticing her pathetic little smile.  He only unburied himself to take his second cup of coffee, then he said, without looking at her,  ""It's a beastly nuisance, the War Office want me to extend my leave--hanged if I do.""  Estelle thanked Heaven in a flash and passed him the marmalade. She had never dreamed the War Office could be so efficient.  ""That shows,"" she said gracefully, ""what they think of you!""  Winn turned his sardonic eyes towards her. ""Thanks,"" he drawled, ""I dare say it's the kind of thing you'd like. They propose that I should stay on here at the Staff College for another year and write 'em a damned red tape report on Tibet."" His irony, dropped from him. ""If it was a job,"" he said in a low voice, ""I'd go like a shot.""  ""Mightn't it mean promotion?"" she asked a little nervously. Winn shrugged his shoulders. ""I can write anything they want out there,"" he said gloomily. ""All I want is ink! What I know I've got in my head, you see. I'd take that with me.""  ""But you couldn't talk things over with them or answer their questions, could you?"" Estelle intelligently ventured. She had an intelligence which ripened along the line of her desires.  ""I could tell them anything they want to know in ten minutes!"" said Winn impatiently. ""They don't want information, they want a straight swift kick! They know what I think--they just want me to string out a lot of excuses for them not to act! Besides the chief thing is--they'd have to send for me, if there was a row--I know the ground and the other chaps don't. I wish to God there'd be a row!""  Estelle sighed and gazed pathetically out of the window. Her eyes rested on the bed where the hyacinths were planted, and beyond it to gorse bushes and a corrugated iron shed.  They were at Aldershot, which was really rather a good place for meeting suitable people. ""What do you intend to do?"" she asked, trembling a little. Winn was at his worst when questioned as to his intentions; he preferred to let them explode like fire-crackers.  ""Do!"" he snorted, ""Write and tell 'em when they've got any kind of job on the size of six-pence I'll be in it! And if not Tibet's about as useful to draw up a report on--as ice in the hunting season--and I'm off in March--and that's that!""  A tear rolled down Estelle's cheek and splashed on the tablecloth; she trembled harder until her teaspoon rattled.  Winn looked at her. ""What's up?"" he asked irritably. ""Anything wrong?""  ""I suppose,"" she said, prolonging a small sob, ""you don't care what I feel about going to India?""  ""But you knew we were always going out in March didn't you?"" he asked, as if that had anything to do with it! The absurd face value that he gave to facts was enough to madden any woman. Estelle sobbed harder.  ""I never knew I should be so unhappy!"" she moaned. Winn looked extremely foolish and rather conscience-stricken; he even made a movement to rise, but thought better of it.  ""I'm sure I'm awfully sorry,"" he said apologetically. ""I suppose you mean you're a bit sick of me, don't you?"" Estelle wiped her eyes, and returned to her toast. ""Can't you see,"" she asked bitterly, ""that our life together is the most awful tragedy?""  ""Oh, come now,"" said Winn, who associated tragedy solely with police courts and theaters. ""It's not so bad as all that, is it? We can rub along, you know. I dare say I've been rather a brute, but I shall be a lot better company when I'm back in the regiment. We must buck up, that's all! I don't like to bother you about it, but I think you'd see things differently if we had a kid. I do really. I've seen heaps of scratch marriages turn out jolly well--when the kids began to come!""  ""How can you be so disgustingly coarse!"" shuddered Estelle. ""Besides, I'm far too delicate! Not that you would care if I died! You'd just marry again!""  ""Oh, no! I shouldn't do that,"" said Winn in his horrid quiet way which might mean anything. He got up and walked to the window. ""You wouldn't die,"" he observed with his back turned to her. ""You'd be a jolly sight stronger all the rest of your life! I asked Travers!""  ""Oh!"" she cried, ""you don't mean to tell me that you talked me over with that disgusting red-faced man!""  ""I don't talk people over,"" said Winn without turning round. ""He's a doctor. I asked his opinion!""  ""Well,"" she said, ""I think it was horrible of you--and--and most ungentlemanly. If I'd wanted to know, I'd have found out for myself. I haven't the slightest confidence in regimental doctors.""  Winn said nothing. One of the things Estelle most disliked in him was the way in which it seemed as if he had some curious sense of delicacy of his own. She wanted to think of Winn as a man impervious to all refinement, born to outrage the nicer susceptibility of her own mind, but there were moments when it seemed as if he didn't think the susceptibilities of her mind were nice at all. He was not awed by her purity.  He didn't say anything of course, but he let certain subjects prematurely drop.  Suddenly he turned round from the window and fixed his eyes on hers. She thought he was going to be very violent, but he wasn't, he talked quite quietly, only something hard and bright in his eyes warned her to be careful.  ""Look here,"" he said, ""I've thought of something, a kind of bargain! I'll give in to you about this job, if you'll give in to me about the other! It's no use fighting over things, is it?  ""If you'll have a kid, I'll stay on here for a year more; if you won't, I'll clear out in March and you'll have to come with me, for I can't afford two establishments. I don't see what else to offer you unless you want to go straight back to your people. You'd hardly care to go to mine, if they'd have you.  ""But if you do what I ask about the child--I'll meet you all the way round--I swear to--you shan't forget it! Only you must ride straight. If you play me any monkey tricks over it--you'll never set eyes on me again; and I'm afraid you'll have to have Travers, because I trust him, not some slippery old woman who'd let you play him like a fish! D'you understand?""  Estelle stared aghast at this mixture of brutality and cunning. Her mind flew round and round like a squirrel in a cage.  She could have managed beautifully if it hadn't been for Travers. Travers would be as impervious to handling as a battery mule. She really wouldn't be able to do anything with Travers. He looked as if he drank; but he didn't.  Of course having a baby was simply horrid; lots of women got out of it nowadays who were quite happily married.  It was disgusting of Winn to suggest it when he didn't even love her.  But once she had one, if she really did give way, a good deal might be done with it.  Maternity was sacred; being a wife on the other hand was ""forever climbing up the climbing wave,"" there was nothing final about it as there was in being able to say, ""I am the mother of your child!""  Her wistful blue eyes expanded. She saw her own way spreading out before her like a promised land. ""I can't,"" she said touchingly, ""decide all this in a minute.""  He could stay on for two years at the War Office, and Estelle meant him to stay without inconvenience to herself. He tried bargaining with her; but her idea of a bargain was one-sided.  ""I sometimes feel as if you kept me out of everything,"" she said at last.  Estelle was feeling her way; she thought she might collect a few extras to add to her side of the bargain.  Apparently she was right. Winn was all eagerness to meet her. ""How do you mean?"" he asked anxiously.  ""Oh,"" she said contemplatively, ""such heaps of things! One thing, I don't expect you've ever noticed that you never ask your friends to stay here. I've had all mine; you've never even asked your mother! It's as if you were ashamed of me.""  ""I'll ask her like a shot if you like,"" he said eagerly. Estelle was not anxious for a visit from Lady Staines, but she thought it sounded better to begin with her. She let her pass.  ""It's not only your relations,"" she went on; ""it's your friends. What must they think of a wife they are never allowed to see?""  ""But they're such a bachelor crew,"" he objected. ""It never occurred to me you'd care for them--just ordinary soldier chaps like me, not a bit clever or amusing.""  Estelle did not say that crews of bachelors are seldom out of place in the drawing-room of a young and pretty woman. She looked past her husband to where in fancy she beheld the aisle of a church and the young Adonis, who had been his best man, with eyes full of reverence and awe gazing at her approaching figure.  ""I thought,"" she said indifferently, ""you liked that man you insisted on having instead of Lord Arlington at the wedding?""  ""I do,"" said Winn. ""He's my best friend. I meet him sometimes in town, you know.""  ""He must think it awfully funny,"" said Estelle, sadly, ""our never having him down here.""  ""He's not that sort,"" said Winn. ""He was my sub, you know. He wouldn't think anything funny unless I told him to. We know each other rather well.""  ""That makes it funnier still,"" said Estelle, relentlessly.  ""Oh, all right,"" said Winn, after a moment's pause. ""Have him down here if you like. Shall I write to him or will you?""  ""He's your friend,"" said Estelle, politely.  ""Yes,"" said Winn, ""but it's your idea."" There was a peculiar look in his eyes, as if he wanted to warn her about something. He went to the door and then glanced back at her, apparently hoping that she had changed her mind.  Estelle hadn't the faintest intention of changing her mind. She had already decided to put sweet peas in Lionel's room and a marked copy of ""The Road Mender.""  ""You may as well ask him yourself,"" said Winn, ""if you really want him to come.""     CHAPTER VI   It was time, Estelle felt, that the real things of life should come back to her. She had had them before marriage--these real things--light, swift, contacts with chosen spirits; friendships not untinged with a liability to become something less capable of definition. But since her marriage she had been forced into a world of secondary experiences. Winn, to begin with, had stood very much in the way, and when he had ceased to block the paths of sentiment she had not found a substitute. At Aldershot, where they lived, there was an unspoken rule that brides should be left alone. Women called, and men were polite, but when Estelle began those delicate personal conversations which led the way to deeper spiritual contacts she discovered that nothing followed. She could not say that she found the men elusive; stone walls are not elusive, but they do not lend themselves to an easy way across country. As to women, theoretically Estelle desired their friendship just as much as that of men; but in practice she generally found them unsympathetic, and incapable of the finest type of intimacy. They did not seem to know what the word devotion meant. Men did, especially young men, though the older ones talked more about it. Estelle had already seen herself after marriage as a confidante to Winn's young brother officers. She would help them as only a good woman can. (She foresaw particularly how she would help to extricate them from the influences of bad women. It was extraordinary how many women who influenced men at all were bad!) Estelle never had any two opinions about being a good woman herself. She couldn't be anything else. Good women held all the cards, but there was no reason why they shouldn't be attractive; it was their failure to grasp this potentiality, which gave bad women their temporary sway.  It was really necessary in the missionary career open to young and attractive married women, to be magnetic. Up to a certain point men must be led on, because if they didn't care for you in the right way you couldn't do anything with them at all. After that point, they must be gently and firmly stopped, or else they might become tiresome, and that would be bad both for them and for you. Especially with a husband like Winn, who seemed incapable of grasping fine shades, and far too capable of dealing roughly and brutally with whatever he did grasp. There had been a dress, for instance, that he simply refused to let Estelle wear--remarking that it was a bit too thick--though that was really the last quality it had possessed.  The question of congenial friendship was therefore likely to be a difficulty, but Estelle had never forgotten Lionel Drummond. When she stopped thinking about Winn except as an annoyance, it became necessary for her to think of somebody else, and her mind fixed itself at once upon her husband's friend. It seemed to her that in Lionel Drummond she would find a perfect spiritual counterpart. She dreamed of a friendship with him too deep for mere friendliness, too late for accepted love; and it seemed to her exactly the kind of thing she wanted. Hand in hand they would tread the path of duty together, surrounded by a rosy mist.  They might even lead Winn to higher things; but at this point Estelle's imagination balked. She could not see Winn being led--he was too truculent--and he had never in his tenderest moments evinced the slightest taste for higher things. It would be better perhaps if they simply set him a good example. He would be certain not to follow it.  She and Lionel would have terrible moments, of course. Estelle thrilled at the thought of these moments, and from time to time she slightly stretched the elastic of the path of duty to meet them. They would still keep on it, of course; they would never go any further than Petrarch and Laura. These historic philanderers should be their limit, and when the worst came to the worst, Estelle would softly murmur to Lionel, ""Petrarch and Laura have borne it, and we must bear it too.""  She became impatient for Lionel's arrival and bought a new and exquisitely becoming blue chiffon dress. Both she and her maid were so struck by her appearance that when Estelle heard Winn banging about at the last moment in his dressing room, she knocked at his door. Even the lowest type of man can be used as a superior form of looking glass. He shouted ""Come in!"" and stared at her while he fumbled at his collar stud; then he lifted his eyebrows and said ""War-paint--eh?""  ""I only wanted to remind you, dear,"" said Estelle patiently, ""that the key of the wine cellar is in my bureau drawer.""  Lionel arrived before Winn had finished dressing. Estelle greeted him with outstretched hands. ""I am so very glad to see you at last,"" she said in her softest, friendliest voice. ""I think it will do Winn good to have you here.""  Lionel laughed shyly.  ""I shouldn't have thought,"" he said, ""that Winn would need much more good.""  ""Ah, my dear fellow!"" said Winn's voice behind him, ""you don't know how great my needs are. Sorry I couldn't meet you.""  Estelle's beautiful, wavering eyes rested for a moment on her husband. She had never known a man to dress so quickly, and it seemed to her an unnecessary quality.  The dinner was a great success. Both men were absurdly gay. Winn told good stories, laughed at Lionel, and rallied his young wife. She had never seen him like this before, and she put it down to the way one man sets off another.  Estelle felt that she was being a great success, and it warmed her heart. The two men talked for her and listened to her; she had a moment when she thought that perhaps, after all, she needn't relegate Winn to a lower world.  They accepted with enthusiasm her offer to sing to them after dinner and then they kept her waiting in the drawing-room for an hour and a half.  She sat there opposite a tall Italian mirror, quivering with her power, her beauty, her ability to charm, and with nothing before her but the empty coffee-cups.  She played a little, she even sang a little (the house was small) to recall them to a sense of her presence, but inexplicably they clung to their talk. Winn who at ordinary times seemed incapable of more than disconnected fragments of speech was (she could hear him now and then quite distinctly) talking like a cataract; and Lionel was, if anything, worse. Her impatience turned into suspicion. Probably Winn was poisoning his friend's mind against her. Perhaps he was drinking too much, Sir Peter did, and people often took after their fathers. That would have to be another point for Lionel and her to tackle. At last they came in, and Lionel said without any attempt at an apology:  ""We should love some music, Mrs. Winn.""  Winn said nothing. He stuck his hands into his pockets, and stood in front of the fireplace in a horribly British manner while she turned over her songs. Estelle sang rather prettily. She preferred songs of a type that dealt with bitter regret over unexplained partings. She sang them with a great deal of expression and a slight difficulty in letting go of the top notes. After she had sung two or three, Lionel said:  ""Now, Winn, you sing.""  Estelle started. She had never before heard of this accomplishment of her husband's. It occurred to her now that Lionel would think it very strange she hadn't, but he need never know unless Winn gave her away. She need not have been afraid. Winn said quietly, as if he said it to her every evening, ""D'you mind playing for me, Estelle?"" Then he dragged out from under her music a big black book in which he had painstakingly copied and collected his selection of songs.  He had a high, clear baritone, very true and strangely impressive; it filled the little room. When he had finished, Lionel forgot to ask Estelle to sing again. Winn excused himself; he said he had a letter or two to write and left them.  ""It's jolly, your both singing,"" Lionel said, looking at her with the same admiring friendliness he had shown her before. She guessed then that Winn had said nothing against her. After all, at the bottom of her heart she had known he wouldn't. You can't live with a man for five months and not know where you are safe.  Estelle smiled prettily.  ""Yes,"" she said gently, ""music is a great bond,"" and then she began to talk to Lionel about himself.  She had a theory that all men liked to talk exclusively about themselves, and it is certain that most men enjoyed their conversation with her; but in this particular instance she made a mistake. Lionel did not like talking about himself, and above all he disliked sympathetic admiration. He was not a conceited man, and it had not occurred to him that he was a suitable subject for admiration. Nor did he see why he should receive sympathy. He had had an admirably free and happy life with parents who were his dearest friends, and with a friend who was to him a hero beyond the need of definition.  Still, he wouldn't have shrunk from talking about Winn with Estelle. It was her right to talk about him, her splendid, perfect privilege. He supposed that she was a little shy, because she seemed to slip away from their obvious great topic; but he wished, if she wasn't going to talk about Winn, she would leave his people alone.  She tried to sympathize with him about his home difficulties, and when she discovered that he hadn't any, her sympathy veered to the horrible distance he had to be away from it.  ""Oh, well,"" said Lionel, ""it's my father's old regiment, you know; that makes it awfully different. They know as much about my life as I do myself, and when I don't get leave, they often come out to me for a month or two. They're good travelers.""  ""They must be simply wonderful!"" Estelle said ecstatically. Lionel said nothing. He looked slightly amazed. It seemed so funny that Winn, who hadn't much use for ecstasy, should have married a so easily ecstatic wife.  ""I do envy you,"" she said pathetically, ""all that background of home companionship. We were brought up so differently. It was not my parents' fault of course--"" she added rather quickly. Something in Lionel's expression warned her that he would be unsympathetic to confidences against parents.  ""Well, you've got Winn,"" he said, looking at her with his steadfast encouraging eyes, ""you've got your background now."" He was prepared to put up with a little ecstasy on this subject, but Estelle looked away from him, her great eyes strangely wistful and absorbed. She was an extraordinary exquisite and pretty little person, like a fairy on a Christmas tree, or a Dresden china shepherdess, not a bit, somehow, like a wife.  ""Yes,"" she said, twisting her wedding ring round her tiny manicured finger. ""But sometimes I am a little anxious about him--I know it's silly of me.""  Lionel's shyness fell away from him with disconcerting suddenness. ""Why are you anxious?"" he demanded. ""What do you mean, Mrs. Winn?""  Estelle hesitated, she hadn't meant to say exactly what her fear was, she only wanted to arouse the young man's chivalry and to talk in some way that approached intimacy.  Everything must have a beginning, even Petrarch and Laura.  She found Lionel's eyes fixed upon her with a piercing quality difficult to meet. He obviously wouldn't understand if she didn't mean anything--and she hardly knew him well enough to touch on her real difficulties with Winn, those would have to come later.  But she must be anxious about something--she was forced into the rather meager track of her husband's state of health.  ""I don't quite know,"" she mused, ""of course he seems perfectly strong--but I sometimes wonder if he is as strong as he looks.""  Lionel brushed her wonder aside. ""Please tell me exactly what you've noticed,"" he said, as if he were a police sergeant and she were some reluctant and slightly prevaricating witness.  She hadn't, as a matter of fact, noticed anything. ""He sometimes looks terribly tired,"" she said a little uncertainly, ""but I dare say it's all my foolishness, Mr. Drummond. I am afraid I am inclined to be nervous about other people's health--"" Estelle sighed softly. She often accused herself of faults which no one had discovered in her. ""Winn, I am sure, would be the first to laugh at me.""  ""Yes, I dare say he would,"" said Lionel quietly. ""But I never will, Mrs. Winn."" She raised her eyes gratefully to him--at last she had succeeded in touching him.  ""You see,"" Lionel explained, ""I care too much for him myself.""  Her eyes dropped. She had a feeling that Petrarch and Laura had hardly begun like that.  The next few days were very puzzling to Estelle; nobody behaved as she expected them to behave, including herself. She found Lionel always ready to accept her advances with open-hearted cordiality, but she had to make the advances. She had not meant to do this. Her idea had been to be a magnet, and magnets keep quite still; needles do all the moving. But this particular needle (except that it didn't appear at all soft) might have been made of cotton wool.  And Winn wouldn't behave at a disadvantage; he was neither tyrannical nor jealous. He left her a great deal to Lionel, and treated her with good-natured tolerance in private and with correct attention before his friend.  In theory Estelle had always stated her belief in platonic friendship, but she had never been inconvenienced by having to carry it out. One thing had always led to another. She had imagined that Lionel (in his relations with her) would be a happy mixture of Lancelot and Galahad. The Galahad side of him would appear when Lancelot became inconvenient--and the Lancelot side of him would be there to fall back upon when Galahad got too dull. But in their actual relation there seemed to be some important ingredient left out. Of course Lancelot was guilty and Estelle had never for a moment intended Lionel to be guilty, but on the other hand Lancelot was in love with the Queen.  This quality was really essential.  Lancelot had had a great affection for the King of course, but that had been subsidiary; and this was what puzzled Estelle most, was Lionel's feeling for her subsidiary to his feeling for Winn?  Lionel was delightful to her; he waited on her hand and foot; he studied all her tastes and remembered everything she told him. Could playing polo with Winn, going out for walks in the rain, and helping to make saddles in Winn's musty, smelling den appeal to him with greater force than her society? He wasn't in love with any one else, and if men weren't in love with any one else, they were usually in love with Estelle. But with Lionel everything stopped short. They conversed confidentially, they used each other's Christian names, but she was left with the sensation of having come up against an invisible barrier. There was no impact, and there was no curtness; there was simply empty space. She was not even sure that Lionel would have liked her at all if she hadn't been Winn's wife. As it was, he certainly wanted her friendship and took pains to win it. It must be added that he won more than he took pains to win. Estelle for the first time in her life stumbled waveringly into a little love.  The visit prolonged itself from a week to a fortnight. Estelle did not sleep the night before Lionel went. She tossed feverishly to and fro, planning their parting. Surely he would not leave her without a word? Surely there must be some touch of sentiment to this separation, horrible and inevitable, that lay before them?  She remembered afterwards that as she lay in the dark and foresaw her loneliness she wondered if she wouldn't after all risk the Indian frontier to be near him? She was subsequently glad she had decided that she wouldn't.  It was a very wet morning, and Lionel was to leave before lunch. Winn went as usual into his study to play with his eternal experiments in leather. Lionel went with him. She heard the two men laughing together down the passage. Could real friends have laughed if they had minded parting with each other?  She sat at her desk in the drawing-room biting nervously at her pen. He was going; was it possible that there would be no farewell?  Just some terrible flat hand-shake at the door under Winn's penetrating eyes.  But after a time she heard steps returning. Lionel came by himself.  ""Are you busy?"" he asked. ""Shall I bother you if we talk a little?""  ""No,"" she said softly. ""I hoped you would come back.""  Lionel did not answer for a moment. For the first time in their acquaintance he was really a little stirred. He moved about the room restlessly, he wouldn't sit down, though half unconsciously she had put her hand on the chair beside her.  ""Do you know,"" he said at last, ""I've got something to say to you, and I'm awfully afraid it may annoy you.""  Was it really coming, the place at which he would have to be stopped, after all her fruitless endeavors to get him to move in any direction at all? It looked like it; he was very obviously embarrassed and flushed; he did not even try to meet her eyes.  ""The fact is,"" he went on, ""I simply can't go without saying it, and you've been so awfully good to me--you've let me feel we're friends."" He paused, and Estelle leaned forward, her eyes melting with encouragement.  ""I am so glad you feel like that, Lionel,"" she murmured. ""Do please say anything--anything you like. I shall always understand and forgive, if it is necessary for me to forgive.""  ""You're awfully generous,"" he said gratefully. She smiled, and put out her hand again toward the chair. This time he sat down in it, but he turned it to face her.  He was a big man and he seemed to fill the room in which they sat. His blue-gray eyes fixed themselves on hers intently, his whole being seemed absorbed in what he was about to say.  ""You see,"" he began, ""I think you may be making a big mistake. Naturally Winn's awfully fond of you and all that and you've just started life, and you like to live in your own country, surrounded by jolly little things, and perhaps India seems frightening and far away."" Estelle shrank back a little; he put his hand on the back of her chair soothingly. ""Of course it must be hard,"" he said. ""Only I want to explain it to you. Winn's heart is yours, I know, but it's in his work, too, as a man's must be, and his work's out there; it's not here at all.  ""When I came here and looked about me, and saw the house and the garden and the country, where we've had such jolly walks and talks--it all seemed temporary somehow, made up--not quite natural, I can't explain what I mean but not a bit like Winn. I needn't tell you what he is, I dare say you think it's cheek of me to talk about him at all, I can quite understand it if you do, only perhaps there's a side of him I've seen more of, and which makes me want to say what I know he isn't--what I don't think even love can make him be--he isn't tame!""  He stopped abruptly; Estelle's eyes had hardened and grown very cold.  ""I don't know what you mean,"" she said. ""Has he complained of my keeping him here?""  Lionel pushed back his chair.  ""Ah, Mrs. Winn! Mrs. Winn!"" he exclaimed half laughingly, and half reproachfully; ""you know he wouldn't complain. He only told me that he wasn't coming back just yet, and I--well, I thought I saw why he wasn't.""  ""Then,"" she said, turning careful eyes away from him, ""if he hasn't complained, I hardly see why you should attack me like this. I suppose you think I am as unnatural and--and temporary as our surroundings?""  Lionel stood up and looked down at her in a puzzled way.  ""Oh, I say, you know,"" he ventured, ""you're not playing very fair, are you? Of course I'm not attacking you. I thought we were friends, and I wanted to help you.""  ""Friends!"" she said. Her voice broke suddenly into a hard little laugh. ""Well, what else have you to suggest to me about my husband--out of your friendship for me?""  ""You're not forgiving me,"" he reminded her gently, not dreaming what it was she had been prepared to forgive. ""But perhaps I'd better go on and get it all out while I'm about it. You know it isn't only that I think he won't care for staying on here, but I think it's a bit of a risk. I don't want to frighten you, but after a man's had black water fever twice, he's apt to be a little groggy, especially about the lungs. England isn't honestly a very good winter place for him for a year or two--""  Estelle flung up her head.  ""If he was going to be an invalid,"" she said, ""he oughtn't to have married me!""  The silence that followed her speech crept into every corner of the room. Lionel did not look puzzled any more. He stood up very straight and stiff; only his eyes changed. He could not look at her; they were filled with contempt. He gave her a moment or two to disavow her words; he would have given his right hand to hear her do it.  ""I beg your pardon,"" he said at last. ""I have overstated the case if you imagine your husband is an invalid. I think, if you don't mind,"" he added, ""I'll see if my things are ready.""  ""Please do,"" she said, groping in her mind for something left to hurt him with. ""And another time perhaps you will know better than to say for my husband what he is perfectly competent to say for himself.""  ""You are quite right,"" Lionel said quietly; ""another time I shall know better."" The rain against the windows sounded again; she had not heard it before.  He did not come back to say good-by. She heard him talking to Winn in the hall, the dogcart drove up, and then she saw him for the last time, his fine, clear-cut profile, his cap dragged over his forehead, his eyes hard, as they were when he had looked at her. He must have known she stood there at the window watching, but he never looked back. She had expected a terrible parting, but never a parting as terrible as this. Mercifully she had kept her head; it was all she had kept.     CHAPTER VII   It was shortly after Lionel's departure that Estelle realized there was nothing between her and the Indian frontier except the drawing-room sofa. She fixed herself as firmly on this shelter as a limpet takes hold upon a rock. People were extremely kind and sympathetic, and Winn himself turned over a new leaf. He was gentle and considerate to her, and offered to read aloud to her in the evenings.  Nothing shook her out of this condition. The baby arrived, unavailingly as an incentive to health, and not at all the kind of baby Estelle had pictured. He was almost from his first moments a thorough Staines. He was never very kissable, and was anxious as soon as possible to get on to his own feet. At eight months he crawled rapidly across the carpet with a large musical-box suspended from his mouth by its handle; at ten he could walk. He tore all his lawn frocks on Winn's spurs, screamed with joy at his father's footsteps, and always preferred knees to laps.  His general attitude towards women was hostility, he looked upon them as unfortunate obstacles in the path of adventure, and howled dismally when they caressed him. He had more tolerance for his mother who seemed to him an object provided by Providence in connection with a sofa, on purpose for him to climb over.  Her maternal instinct went so far as to allow him to climb over it twice a day for short intervals. After all he had gained her two years.  Estelle lay on the sofa one autumn afternoon at four o'clock, with her eyes firmly shut. She was aware that Winn had come in, and was very inconsiderately tramping to and fro in heavy boots. He seldom entered the drawing-room at this hour, and if he did, he went out again as soon as he saw that her eyes were shut.  Probably he meant to say something horrible about India; she had been expecting it for some time. The report on Tibet was finished, and he could let his staff work go when he liked.  He stood at the foot of her couch and looked at her curiously. Estelle could feel his eyes on her; she wondered if he noticed how thin she was, and how transparent her eyelids were. Every fiber in her body was aware of her desire to impress him with her frailty. She held it before him like a banner.  ""Estelle,"" he said. When he spoke she winced.  ""Yes, dear,"" she murmured hardly above a whisper.  ""Would you mind opening your eyes?"" he suggested. ""I've got something I want to talk over with you, and I really can't talk to a door banged in my face.""  ""I'm so sorry,"" she said meekly; ""I'm afraid I'm almost too exhausted to talk, but I'll try to listen to what you have to say.""  ""Thanks,"" said Winn. He paused as if, after all, it wasn't easy to begin, even in the face of this responsiveness. She thought he looked rather odd. His eyes had a queer, dazed look, as if he had been drinking heavily or as if somebody had kicked him.  ""Well,"" she asked at last, ""what is it you want to talk about? Suspense of any kind, you know, is very bad for my heart.""  ""I beg your pardon,"" he said. ""It was only that I thought I'd better mention I am going to Davos.""  ""Davos!"" She opened her eyes wide now and stared at him. ""That snow place?"" she asked, ""full of consumptives? What a curious idea! I never have been able to understand how people can care to go there for sport. It seems to me rather cruel; but, then, I know I am specially sensitive about that kind of thing. Other people's pain weighs so on me.""  ""I didn't say I was going there for sport,"" Winn answered in the same peculiar manner. He sat down and began to play with a paper-cutter on his knee. ""As a matter of fact, I'm not,"" he went on. ""I've crocked one of my lungs. They seem to think I've got to go. It's a great nuisance.""  It was curious the way he kept looking at her, as if he expected something. He couldn't have told exactly what he expected himself. He was face to face with a new situation; he wasn't exactly frightened, but he had a feeling that he would like very much to know how he ought to meet it. He had often been close to death--but he had never somehow thought of dying, he wasn't close to death now but at the end of something which might be very horrible there would be the long affair of dying. He hoped he would get through it all right and not make a fuss or be a bother to anybody. It had all come with a curious suddenness. He had gone to Travers one day because when Polly pulled he had an odd pain in his chest. He had had a toss the week before, and it had occurred to him that a rib might be broken; but Travers said it wasn't that.  Travers had tapped him all over and looked grave, uncommonly grave, and said some very uncomfortable things. He had insisted on dragging Winn up to town to see a big man, and the big man had said, ""Davos, and don't lose any time about it."" He hadn't said much else, only when Winn had remarked, ""But, damn it all, you know I'm as strong as a horse,"" he had answered, ""You'll need every bit of strength you've got,"" and all the way home Travers had talked to him like a Dutch uncle.  It was really funny when you came to think of it, because there wasn't anything to see or even feel--except a little cough--and getting rather hot in the evenings, but after Travers had finished pitching into him Winn had written to Lionel and made his will and had rather wondered what Estelle would feel about it. He hadn't wanted to upset her. He hadn't upset her. She stared at him for a moment; then she said:  ""How odd! You look perfectly all right. I never have believed in Travers.""  Winn mentioned the name of the big man.  ""It does sound rather rot,"" he added apologetically. He still waited. Estelle moved restlessly on the sofa.  ""Well,"" she said, ""what on earth am I to do? It's really horribly inconvenient. I suppose I shall have to go back to my people for the winter unless you can afford to let me take a flat in London.""  ""I'm afraid I can't afford that,"" said Winn. ""I think it would be best for you to go to your people for the winter, unless, of course, you'd rather go to mine. I'm going down there to-morrow; I've written to tell them. I must get my father to let me have some money as it is. It's really an infernal nuisance from the expense point of view.""  ""I couldn't go to your people,"" said Estelle, stiffly. ""They have never been nice to me; besides, they would be sure to teach baby how to swear."" Then she added, ""I suppose this puts an end to your going to India.""  Winn dropped his eyes.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""this puts an end to my going back to India for the present. I've been up before the board; they're quite agreeable. In fact, they've been rather decent to me.""  Estelle gave a long sigh of relief and gratitude. It was really extraordinary how she had been helped to avoid India. She couldn't think what made Winn go on sitting there, just playing with the paper-knife.  He sat there for a long time, but he didn't say any more. At last he got up and went to the door.  ""Well,"" he said, ""I think I'll just run up and have a look at the kid.""  ""Poor dear,"" said Estelle, ""I'm frightfully sorry for you, of course, though I don't believe it's at all painful--and by the way, Winn, don't forget that consumption is infectious.""  He stopped short as if someone had struck him. After all, he didn't go to the nursery; she heard him go down the passage to the smoking-room instead.     CHAPTER VIII   Sir Peter was having his annual attack of gout. Staines Court appeared at these times like a ship battened down and running before a storm.  Figures of pale and frightened maids flickered through the long passage-ways. The portly butler violently ejected from the dining-room had been seen passing swiftly through the hall, with the ungainly movement of a prehistoric animal startled from its lair.  The room in which Sir Peter sat burned with his language. Eddies of blasphemous sound rushed out and buffeted the landings like a rising gale.  Sir Peter sat in a big arm chair in the center of the room. His figure gave the impression of a fortressed island in the middle of an empty sea. His foot was rolled in bandages and placed on a low stool before him; within reach of his hand was a knobbed blackthorn stick, a bell and a copy of the ""Times"" newspaper.  Fortunately Lady Staines was impervious to sound and acclimatized to fury. When Sir Peter was well she frequently raised storms, but when he had gout she let him raise them for himself. He was raising one now on the subject of Winn's letter.  ""What's that he says? What's that he says?"" roared Sir Peter. ""Something the matter with his lungs! That's the first time a Staines has ever spoken of his lungs. The boy's mad. I don't admit it! I don't believe it for a moment, all a damned piece of doctors' rubbish, the chap's a fool to listen to 'em! When has he ever seen me catering to hearse-conducting, pocket-filling asses!""  Charles was home on a twenty-four hours' leave--he stood by the mantelpiece and regarded his parent with undutiful and critical eyes. ""I should say you send for 'em,"" he observed, ""whenever you've got a pain; why they're always hangin' about. Look at that table chock full of medicines. 'Nuff to kill a horse--where do they come from?""  ""Hold your infernal tongue, Sir!"" shouted Sir Peter. ""What do I have 'em for? I have 'em here to expose them! That's why--I just let them try it on, and then hold them up to ridicule! Do you find I ever pay the least attention to 'em, Sarah?"" he demanded from his wife.  ""Not as a rule,"" Lady Staines admitted, ""unless you're very bad indeed, and then you do as you like directly the pain has stopped.""  ""Well, why shouldn't I!"" said Sir Peter triumphantly. ""Once I get rid of the pain I can do as I like. When I've got red hot needles eating into my toes, am I likely to like anything? Of course not, you may just as well take medicine then as anything else, but as to taking orders from a pack of ill-bred bumpkins, full of witch magic as a dog of fleas, I see myself! Don't stand grinning there, Charles, like a dirty, shock-headed barmaid's dropped hair pin! I won't stand it! I can't see why all my sons should have thin legs, neither you nor I, Sarah, ever went about like a couple of spilikin's. I call it indecent! Why don't you get something inside 'em, Charles, eh? No stamina, that's what it is! Everybody going to the dogs in motor cars with manicure girls out of their parents' pockets--! Why don't you answer me, Charles, when I speak to you?""  ""Nobody can answer you when you keep roaring like a deuced megaphone,"" said Charles wearily. ""Let's hear what the chap's got to say for himself, Mater.""  Lady Staines read Winn's letter out loud in a dry voice without expression; it might have been an account of a new lawn mower which she held beneath it.       ""I've managed to crock one of my lungs somehow, but they say I've      got a chance if I go straight out to Davos for six months. Ask the      guv'nor if he'll let me have some money. I shall want it badly. My      wife and the kid will go to her people. You might run across and      have a look at him sometimes. He's rather a jolly little chap. I      shall come down for the week-end to-morrow unless I hear from you      to the contrary.       ""Your affectionate son,      ""WINN.""  ""I think that's all,"" said his mother.  ""What!"" shouted Sir Peter. He had never shouted quite like this before. Charles groaned and buried his head in his hands. Even Lady Staines looked up from the lawn mower's letter, which she had placed on the top of Winn's; the medicine bottles sprang from the table and fell back again sufficiently shaken for the next dose.  ""Do you mean to tell me!"" cried Sir Peter in a quieter voice, ""that that little piece of dandelion fluff--that baggage--that city fellow's half baked, peeled onion of a minx is going to desert her husband? That's what I call it--desertion! What does she want to go back to her people for? She must go with him! She must go to Davos! She shall go to Davos! if I have to take her there by the hair! I never heard of anything so outrageous in my life! What becomes of domesticity? where's family life? That's what I want to know! and is Winn such a milk and water noodle that he's going to sit down under it and say 'Thank you!' Not that I think he needs to go to Davos for a moment, mind you. Let him come here and have a nice quiet time with me, that's what he wants.""  ""That's all very well, Father,"" said Charles. ""But what you mean is you don't want to fork out! If the chap's told to go to Davos, he's got to go to Davos, and it's his own look-out whether he takes his wife with him or not. Consumption isn't a joke, and I tell you plainly that if you don't help him when he's got a chance, you needn't expect _me_ to come to the funeral. No flowers and coffins and beloved sons on tombstones, are going to make me move an inch. It'll be just the same to me as if you'd shoved him under with your own hand, and that's all I've got to say, and it's no use blowing the roof off about it!""  ""You'd better go now, Charles,"" said Lady Staines quietly.  When Sir Peter had finished saying what he thought of Charles and what he intended to do to the entail, Lady Staines gave him his medicine.  ""Look here, Peter,"" she said, ""this is a bad business about our boy.""  Sir Peter met her eyes and nodded.  ""Yes,"" he agreed, ""a damned bad business!""  ""We'd better get him off,"" she added after a moment's pause.  ""It's all nonsense,"" grumbled Sir Peter, ""and I told you from the first you ought never to have let him marry that girl. Her father's the poorest tenant I ever had, soft-headed, London vermin! He doesn't know anything about manure--and he'll never learn. I shall cut down all his trees as soon as I'm about again. As for the girl, keep her out of my sight or I'll wring her neck. I ought to have done it long ago. How much does he want?""  ""Let's make it three hundred,"" Lady Staines said. ""He may as well be comfortable.""  ""Pouring money into a sieve,"" grumbled Sir Peter. ""Send for the doctor and bring me the medical dictionary. I may as well see what it says about consumption, and don't mention the word when Winn's about. I _will_ have tact! If you'd used common or garden tact in this house before, that marriage would never have taken place. I sit here simmering with it day in and day out and everybody else goes about giving the whole show away! If it hadn't been for my tact Charles would have married that manicure girl years ago. Bring me my check-book. It's nothing but a school-boy's lark, this going to Davos. Why consumption's a pin-prick compared to gout! No pain--use of both legs--sanguine disposition. Where the hell's that medical dictionary? Ah, it's there, is it--then why the devil didn't you give it me before?""  Sir Peter read solemnly for a few minutes, and then flung the book on the floor.  ""Bosh!"" he cried angrily. ""All old woman's nonsense. Can't tell what's going on inside a pair of bellows--can they? Then why make condemned asses of themselves, and say they can! Don't tell Charles I've written this check--he's the most uncivil rascal we've got.""     CHAPTER IX   It was odd how Winn looked forward to seeing Staines; he couldn't remember ever having paid much attention to the scenery before; he had always liked the bare backs of the downs behind the house where he used to exercise the horses, and the turf was short and smelt of thyme; and of course the shooting was good and the house stood well; but he hadn't thought about it till now, any more than he thought about his braces.  He decided to walk up from the station. There was a short cut through the fields and then you came on the Court suddenly, over-looking a sheet of water.  It was a still November day, colorless and sodden. The big elms were as dark as wet haystacks and the woods huddled dispiritedly in a vague mist.  The trees broke to the right of the Court and the house rose up like a gigantic silver ghost.  It was a battered old Tudor building with an air of not having been properly cleaned; blackened and weather-soaked, unconscionably averse from change, it had held its own for four hundred years.  The stones looked as if they were made out of old moonlight and thin December sunshine. A copse of small golden trees, aspen and silver birches made a pale screen of light beside the house and at its feet, the white water stretched like a gleaming eye.  There wasn't a tree Winn hadn't climbed or an inch he hadn't explored, fought over and played on. He wanted quite horribly to come back to it again, it was as if there were roots from the very soil in him tugging at his menaced life.  His mother advanced across the lawn to meet him. She wore a very old blue serge dress and a black and white check cap which looked as if it had been discarded by a jockey.  In one hand she held a trowel and in the other a parcel of spring bulbs. She gave Winn the side of her hard brown cheek to kiss and remarked, ""You've just come in time to help me with these bulbs. Every one of them must be got in this afternoon. Philip has left us--your father threw a watering can at him. I can't think what's happened to the men nowadays, they don't seem to be able to stand anything, and I've sent Davis into the village to buy ducks. He ought to have been back long ago if it was only ducks, but probably it's a girl at the mill as well.""  Winn looked at the bulbs with deep distaste. ""Hang it all, Mother,"" he objected, ""it's such a messy day for planting bulbs!"" ""Nonsense,"" said Lady Staines firmly, ""I presume you wash your hands before dinner, don't you, you can get the dirt off then? It's a perfect day for bulbs as you'd know if you had the ghost of country sense in you. There's another trowel in the small greenhouse, get it and begin."" Winn strode off to the greenhouse smiling; he had had an instinctive desire to get home, he wanted hard sharp talk that he could answer as if it were a Punch and Judy show.  In his married life he had had to put aside the free expression of his thoughts; you couldn't hit out all round if the other person wouldn't hit back and started whining. Every member of the Staines family had been brought up on the tradition of combative speech, the bleakest of personalities found its nest there. Sometimes, of course, you got too much of it. Sir Peter and Charles were noisy and James and Dolores were apt to be brutally rough. They were all vehement but there were different shades in their ability. Winn got through the joints in their armor as easily as milk slips into a glass. It was Lady Staines and Winn who were the deadly fighters.  They fought the others with careless ease, but they fought each other watchfully with fixed eyes and ready implacable brains.  It was difficult to say what they fought for but it was a magnificent spectacle to see them fight, and they had for each other a regard which, if it was never tender, had every element of respect.  They worked now for some time in silence. Suddenly Lady Staines cocked a wintry blue eye in her son's direction and remarked, ""Why ain't your wife going with you to Davos?"" Winn hurled a bulb into the small hole prepared for it before answering, then he said:  ""She's too delicate to stand the cold.""  ""Is there anything the matter with her?"" asked his mother.  Winn preferred to consider this question in the light of rhetoric and made no reply. He wasn't going to give Estelle away by saying there was nothing the matter with her, and on the other hand a lie would have been pounced upon and torn to pieces. ""Marriage don't seem to have agreed with either of you particularly well,"" observed Lady Staines with a grim smile.  ""We haven't got your constitution,"" replied her son. ""If either you or Father had married any one else--they'd have been dead within six months.""  ""Humph!"" said his mother. ""That only shows our sound judgment; we took what we could stomach! It's her look-out of course, but I suppose she knows she's running you into the Divorce Court, letting you go out there by yourself? All those snow places bristle with grass widows and girls who have outstayed their market and have to get a hustle on! Sending a man out there alone is like driving a new-born lamb into a pack of wolves!"" Lady Staines with her eye on the heavily built and rather leathery lamb beside her gave a sardonic chuckle. Winn ignored her illustration.  ""You needn't be afraid,"" he replied. ""I'm done with women; they tempt me about as much as stale sponge cakes.""  ""Ah!"" said his mother, ""I've heard that tale before. A man who says he's done with women simply means one of them's done with him. Besides, you're to be an invalid, I understand! An invalid man is as exposed to women as a young chicken to rats. You won't stand a ghost of a chance. Look at your father, if I left him alone when he was having an attack of gout with a gray-haired matron of a reformatory, he'd be on his knees to her before I could get back.""  ""You can take it from me,"" said Winn, ""that even if I _should_ need such a thing as a petticoat, I'd try a kind that won't affect marriage. I'll never look at another good woman again--the other sort will do for me if I can't stick it without.""  ""Don't racket too much,"" said Lady Staines, planting her last bulb with scientific skill. ""They say keeping women's very expensive up there--on account of the Russian Princes.""  ""By the by,"" said Winn, ""thanks for the money. Had any difficulty in extracting it?""  ""Not much,"" said Lady Staines, withdrawing to the lawn. ""Charles got rather in the way.""  ""Silly ass,"" observed Winn. ""Didn't want me to have it, I suppose?""  ""No, he did want you to have it,"" replied Lady Staines, ""but he needn't have been such a fool as to have said so. It nearly upset everything. His idea was, you see, that if his father gave you something--he and James would have to be bought off. So they were in the end, but they'd have had more if he'd played his hand better.""  Winn laughed. ""Jolly to be home again,"" he remarked. ""Dinner as usual?""  ""Yes,"" said Lady Staines, ""and don't forget one of the footmen's a Plymouth Brother and mustn't be shocked. It's so difficult to get any one nowadays, one mustn't be too particular. He said he could stand your father by constant prayer, but he gave notice over Charles. Charles ought to have waited till dessert to let himself go.""  The dinner passed off well. Sir Peter and Winn had one never failing bone of contention, the rival merits of the sister services. Sir Peter expressed on every possible occasion in his son's presence, a bitter contempt for the army, and Winn never let an opportunity pass without pointing out the gorged and pampered state of the British Navy.  ""If we'd had half the money spent on us, Sir, that you keep guzzling over,"" Winn cheerfully threw out, ""we could knock spots out of Europe. The trouble with England is--she treats her sailors as if they were the proud sisters--and we are shoved out like Cinderella into the scullery to do all the dirty work.""  ""Pooh!"" said Sir Peter, ""work! Is that what you call it--takin' a horse out for an hour or two, and shoutin' at a few men on a parade ground. What's an army good for--even when it's big enough to be seen with the naked eye and capable of attacking a few black savages with their antiquated weapons. Why you're _safe_, that's what you are--dead safe! Land's beneath you--immovable--you can get anywhere you want to as easy as sliding down banisters! Targets keep still too! It's nothing to hit a thing you can stand to fire at while _it_ stands still to _be_ fired at! Child's play, that's what it is. Look at us, something up all the time, peace or war. We've got the sea to fight--wind too--and thick weather. We've got our pace to mind and if we ever did clinch up we'd have to do our fighting at a rate that'd make an express train giddy--and running after a target goin' as hard as we do! That's what I call something of a service. No! No! The Army's played out. You're for ornament now, meant to go round Buckingham Palace and talk to nurse-maids in the Park.""  ""Not many nurse-maids in the Kyber Pass,"" his son observed.  ""Frontiers--yes, I dare say,"" snorted Sir Peter. ""A few black rag dolls behind trees popping at you to keep your circulation going, and you with Maxims and all, going picnics in the hills and burning down villages as easy as pulling fire-crackers--and half the time you want help from us! Look at South Africa!""  They looked at South Africa for some time till the dessert came and the Plymouth Brother thankfully withdrew. After that Winn allowed himself some margin and Lady Staines leaned back in her chair, ate grapes and enjoyed her coffee.  The conversation became pungent, savage and enlivened on Sir Peter's part by strange oaths.  Winn kept to sudden thrusts of irony impossible to foresee and difficult to parry.  They drank velvety ripe old port. Sir Peter was for the moment out of pain and anxious to assert his freedom from doctors. The conversation shifted to submarines. Sir Peter thought them an underhand and decadent development suited to James, who was in command of one of them.  As to aeroplanes he said that as we'd now succeeded in imitating infernal birds and fishes--he supposed we'd soon bring off reptiles the kind of creature the modern young would be likely to represent best.  ""We shall soon have the police crawling on their bellies up and down the Strand hiding behind lamp-posts,"" finished Sir Peter. ""Call that kind of thing science! It's an inverted Noah's Ark! That's what it is! And when you get it all going to suit yourself, there'll be another flood, and serve you all damned well right. I shall enjoy seeing you drown!""  Winn replied that you had to fight with your head now and that people who fought with their fists were about as dangerous as stuffed rabbits.  Sir Peter replied that in the end everything came down to blood, how much you'd got yourself and how much you could get out of the enemy.  Lady Staines was slightly afraid of leaving them in this atmosphere, but at last she reluctantly withdrew to the hall, where she listened to the varying shades of Sir Peter's voice and decided they were on the whole loud enough to be normal.  At eleven o'clock she and Winn between them assisted Sir Peter to bed.  This was a sharp and fiery passage usually undertaken by the toughest of the gardeners.  Winn however managed extraordinarily well. He insisted on occasional pauses and by a home truth of an appallingly personal nature actually silenced his father for the last half flight.  Sir Peter breakfasted in his room.  He had had a bad night. He wouldn't, as he explained to his wife, have minded if Winn had been a puny chap; but there he was, sound and strong, with clear hard eyes, broad, straight shoulders and a grip of iron, and yet Taylor, that little village hound of an apothecary, said once you had microbes it didn't matter how strong you were--they were just as likely to be fatal as if you were a narrow-chested epileptic.  Microbes! The very thought of such small insignificant creatures getting in his way filled Sir Peter with fury. He had always hated insects. But the worst of it was in the morning he didn't feel angry, he simply felt chilled and helpless. His son was hit and he couldn't help him. It all came back to that. There was only one person who could help a sick man, and that person was his wife. Theoretically Sir Peter despised and hated women, but practically he leaned on his wife as only a strong man can lean on a woman; without her, he literally would not have known which way to turn. His trust in her was as solid as his love for a good stout ship. In every crisis of his life she had stood by his side, bitter tongued, hard-headed, undemonstrative and his as much as any ship that had sailed under his flag.  If she had failed him he would have gone down, and now here was his son's wife--another woman--presumably formed for the same purpose, leaking away from under him at the very first sign of weather.  He thought of Estelle with a staggered horror; she had looked soft and sweet--just the woman to minister to a knocked-out man. The trouble with her was she had no guts.  Sir Peter woke his wife up at four o'clock in the morning to shout this fact into her ear. Lady Staines said, ""Well--whoever said she had?"" and apparently went to sleep again. But Sir Peter didn't go to sleep: Estelle reminded him of how he had once been done over a mare, a beautiful, fine stepping lady-like creature who looked as if she were made of velvet and steel, no vice in her and every point correct; and then what had happened? He'd bought her and she'd developed a spirit like wet cotton wool, no pace, no staying power. She'd sweat and stumble after a few minutes run, no amount of dieting, humoring or whipping affected her. She'd set out to shirk, and shirk she did--till he worked her off on a damned fool Dolores had fortunately introduced him to--only wives can't be handed on like mares--""Devil's the pity""--Sir Peter said to himself, as he fell off to sleep. ""Works perfectly with horses.""  Winn came up-stairs soon after breakfast a little set and silent, to say good-by to his father. Sir Peter had thrown his breakfast out of the window and congealed the Plymouth Brother's morning prayers. He wanted to get hold of something tangible to move circumstances and cheat fate, but he couldn't think what you did do, when it wasn't a question of storms or guns--or a man you could knock down for insubordination, simply a physical fact.  He scowled gloomily at his son's approach. ""I wish you weren't such a damned fool,"" he observed by way of greeting. ""Why can't you shake a little sense into your wife? What's marriage for? I've been talking to your mother about it. I don't say she isn't a confoundedly aggravating woman, your mother! But she's always stuck to me, hasn't let me down, you know. A wife ain't meant to do that. It's unnatural! Why can't you say to her, 'You come with me or I'll damned well show you the reason why--' That's the line to take!""  ""A woman you've got to say that to isn't going to make much of a companion,"" Winn said quietly. ""I'd rather she stayed where she liked.""  Sir Peter was silent for a moment, then he said, ""Any more children coming?""  ""No,"" said his son, ""nor likely to be either, as far as I'm concerned.""  ""There you are!"" said Sir Peter. ""Finicky and immoral, that's what I call it! That's the way trouble begins, the more children the less nonsense. Why don't you have more children instead of sitting sneering at me like an Egyptian Pyramid?""  ""That's my look-out,"" said Winn with aggravating composure. ""When I want 'em, I'll have 'em. Don't you worry, Father.""  ""That's all devilish well!"" said Sir Peter crossly. ""But I _shall_ worry! Do I know more about the world or do you? Not that I want to quarrel with you, my dear boy,"" he added hastily. ""I admit things are awkward for you--damned awkward--still it's no use sitting down under them when you might have a row and clear the air, is it? What I want to say is--why not have a row?""  ""You can't have a row with a piece of pink silk, can you?"" his son demanded. ""I don't want to blame her, but it's no use counting her in; besides, honestly, Father, I don't care a rap--why should I expect her to? My marriage was a misdeal.""  Sir Peter shook his head. ""Men ought to love their wives,"" he said solemnly; ""in a sense, of course, no fuss about it, and never letting them know--and not putting oneself out about it! But still there ought to be something to hold on to, and anyhow the more you stick together, the more there is, and your going off like this won't improve matters. Love or no love, marriage is a life.""  Winn laughed again. ""Life--"" he said, ""yes--well--how do I know how much longer I shall have to bother about life?""  There was a silence. Sir Peter's gnarled old hands met above his blackthorn stick and trembled.  Winn wished he hadn't spoken. He did not know how to tell his father not to mind. He hadn't really thought his father would mind.  However, there they sat, minding it.  Then Sir Peter said, ""I don't believe in consumption, I never have, and I never shall; besides Taylor says Davos is a very good place for it, and you're an early case, and it's all damned nonsense, and you've got to buck up and think no more about it. What I want to hear is that you're back in your Regiment again. I dare say there'll be trouble later on, and then where'll you be if you're an invalid--have you ever thought of that?""  ""Yes--that'd be something to live for,"" Winn said gravely; ""trouble.""  ""You shouldn't be so confoundedly particular,"" said his father. ""Now look at me--if we did have trouble where'd I be? Nowhere at all--old! Just gout and newspapers and sons getting up ideas about their lungs, but when do I complain?  ""If you want another L50 any time--I don't say that I can't give it to you--though the whole thing's damned unremunerative! There's the trap. Well--good-by.""  Winn stood quite still for a moment looking at his father. It might have been thought by an observer that his eyes, which were remarkably bright, were offensively critical, but Sir Peter, though he wished the last moment to end, knew that his son was not being critical.  Then Winn said, ""Well--good-by, Father. I'm sure I'm much obliged to you."" And his father said, ""Damn everything!"" just after the door was shut.     CHAPTER X   It hadn't seemed dismal at first, it had only seemed quite unnatural. Everything had stopped being natural when the small creature in lawn, only the height of his knee, had been torn reluctantly away from its hold on his trousers. This parting had made Winn feel as if something inside him was being unfairly handled.  There was nothing he could get hold of in Peter to promise security, and the only thing that Peter could grasp was the trousers, which had had to be forcibly removed from him.  Later on Peter would be consoled by a Teddy Bear or the hearth brush, but Winn had had to go before Peter was consoled, and without the resources of the hearth brush.  Estelle wept bitterly in the hall, but Winn hadn't minded that; he had long ago come to the conclusion that Estelle had a taste for tears, just as some people liked boiled eggs for breakfast. He simply patted her on the shoulder and looked away from her while she kissed him.  He had enjoyed starting from Charing Cross, intimidating the porters and giving the man who registered his luggage dispassionate and unfavorable pieces of his mind. But when he was once fairly off he began to have a new feeling. It came over him when he was out of England and had crossed the small gray strip of formless familiar sea--the sea itself always seemed to Winn to belong much more to England than to France--so much so that it annoyed him at Boulogne to have to submit to being thought possibly unblasphemous by porters. He began to feel alone. Up till now he had always seen his way. There had been fellows to do things with and animals; even marriage, though disconcerting, had not set him adrift. He had been cramped by it, but not disintegrated. Now what seemed to have happened was that he had been cut loose. There wasn't the regiment or even a staff college to fall back upon. There wasn't a trail to follow or horses to gentle; his very dog had had to be left behind because of the ridiculous restrictions of canine quarantine.  It really was an extraordinarily uncomfortable feeling, as if he were a damned ghost poking about in a new world full of surprises. It was quite possible that he might find himself among bounders. He had always avoided bounders, but that had been comparatively easy in a world where everybody observed an unspoken, inviolable code. If people didn't know the ropes, they found it simpler to go, and Winn had sometimes assisted them to find it simpler; but he saw that now bounders could really turn up with impunity, for, as far as ropes went, it was he himself who would be in the minority. He might meet men who talked, long-haired, mysterious chaps too soft to kick or radicals, though if the worst came to the worst, he flattered himself that he had always the resource of being unpleasant.  He knew that when the hair rose up on his head like the back of a challenged bull-dog, and he stuck his hands in his pockets and looked at people rather straight between the eyes, they usually shut up.  He didn't mind doing this of course, if necessary; only if he had to do it to everybody in the hotel it might become monotonous, and he had a nervous fear that consumption was rather a cad's disease.  Fortunately he had got his skates, and he supposed there'd be toboggans and skis. He would see everybody in hell before he would share a table.  It was curious how one could get to thirty-six and then suddenly in the middle of nothing start up a whole new set of feelings--feelings about Peter, who had, after all, only just happened, and yet seemed to have belonged to him always; and his lungs going wrong, and loneliness, like a homesick school-girl! Winn had never felt lonely in Central Africa or Tibet, so that it seemed rather absurd to start such an emotion in a railway train surrounded by English people, particularly as it had nothing to do with what he looked upon as his home. His feeling about leaving the house at Aldershot had been, ""Thank God there aren't going to be any more dinners!""  Still, there it was. He did feel lonely; probably it was one of the symptoms of bad lungs which Travers hadn't mentioned, the same kind of thing as the perfectly new desire to lean back in his corner and shut his eyes.  He felt all right in a way, his muscles acted, he could easily have thrown a stout young man with white eyelashes passing along the corridor through the nearest window; but there was a blurred sensation behind everything, a tiresome, unaccountable feeling as if he mightn't always be able to do things. He couldn't explain it exactly; but if it really turned up at all formidably later, he intended to shoot himself quickly before Peter got old enough to care.  One thing he had quite made up his mind about: he would get well if he could, but if he couldn't, he wasn't going to be looked after. The mere thought of it drove him into the corridor, where he spent the night alternately walking up and down and sitting on an extremely uncomfortable small seat by a draughty door to prove to himself that he wasn't in the least tired.  He began to feel rather better after the coffee at Basle, and though he was hardly the kind of person to take much interest in mere scenery, the small Swiss villages, with their high pink or blue clock-faced churches made him wish he could pack them into a box, with a slice of green mountain behind, and send them to Peter to play with.  After Landeck he smelt the snows, and challenged successfully the whole shivering carriage on the subject of an open window. The snows reminded Winn in a jolly way of Kashmir and nights spent alone on dizzy heights in a Dak bungalow.  The valleys ceased slowly to breathe, the dull autumn coloring sank into the whiteness of a dream. The mountains rose up on all sides, wave upon wave of frozen foam, aiming steadily at the high, clear skies. The half-light of the failing day covered the earth with a veil of silver and retreating gold.  The valleys passed into silence, freezing, whispering silence. The moon rose mysteriously behind a line of black fir-trees, sending shafts of blue light into the hollow cup of mountain gorges. It was a poet's world, Blake or Shelley could have made it, it was too cold for Keats. Winn had not read these poets. It reminded him of a particularly good chamois hunt, in which he had bagged a splendid fellow, after four hours' hard climbing and stalking. The mountains receded a little, and everything became part of a white hollow filled with black fir-trees, and beyond the fir-trees a blue lake as blue as an Indian moonstone, and then one by one, with the unexpectedness of a flight of glow-worms, sparkled the serried ranks of the hotels. Out they flashed, breaking up the mystery, defying the mountains, as insistent and strident as life.  The train stopped, and its contents spilled themselves out a little uncertainly and stiffly on the platform. Instantly the cold caught them, not the insidious, subtle cold of lower worlds, but the fresh, brusk buffet of the Alps. It caught them by the throat and chest, it tingled in ears and noses; there was no menace in it, and no weakness. It was as compulsory as a policeman in a street fight.  Winn had just stepped aside to allow a clamorous lady to take possession of his porter when he saw a man struggle into the light under a lamp-post; he was carrying something very carefully in his arms.  Winn could not immediately make out what it was, but he saw the man's face and read utmost mortal misery in his eyes; then he discovered that the burden was a woman. Her hands were so thin that they lay like broken flower petals on the man's shoulders; her face was nothing but a hollow shell; her eyes moved, so that Winn knew she was alive, and in the glassy stillness of the air he caught her dry whispering voice, ""I am not really tired, dearest,"" she murmured. In a moment they had vanished. It struck Winn as very curious that people could love each other like that, or that a dying woman should fight her husband's fears with her last strength. He felt horribly sorry for them and impatient with himself for feeling sorry. After all, he had not come up to Davos to go about all over the place feeling sorry for strange people to whom he had never been introduced. The funny part of it was that he didn't only feel sorry for them, he felt a little sorry for himself. Was love really like that? And had he missed it? Well, of course he knew he had missed it, only he hadn't realized that it was quite like that.  Fortunately at this moment a German porter appeared to whom Winn felt an instant simple antagonism. He was a self-complacent man, and he brought Winn the wrong luggage.  ""Look here, my man,"" Winn said smoothly, but with a rocky insistence behind his words, ""if you don't look a little sharp and bring me the _right_ boxes with green labels, I shall have to kick you into the middle of next week.""  This restored Winn even more quickly than it restored his luggage. No one followed him into the small stuffy omnibus which glided off swiftly toward its destination. The hotel was an ugly wooden house in the shape of a hive built out with balconies; it reminded Winn of a gigantic bird-cage handsomely provided with perches. It was only ten o'clock, but the house was as silent as the mountains behind it.  The landlord appeared, and, leading Winn into a brilliantly lighted, empty room, offered him cold meat.  Winn said the kind of thing that any Staines would feel called upon to say on arriving at a cold place at a late hour and being confronted with cold meat.  The landlord apologized in a whisper, and returned after some delay with soup. Nothing, not even more language, could move him beyond soup. He kept saying that it was late and that they must be quiet, and he didn't seem to believe Winn when Winn remarked that he hadn't come up there to be quiet. Winn himself became quieter as he followed the landlord through interminable passages covered with linoleum where his boots made a noise like muffled thunder.  Everywhere there was a strange sense of absolute cleanliness and silence, the subduing smell of disinfectant and the sight of padded, green felt doors.  When Winn was left alone in a room like a vivid cell, all emptiness and electric light, and with another green door leading into a farther room, he became aware of a very faint sound that came from the other side of the door. It was like the bark of a dog shut up in a distant cellar; it explained the padding of the doors.  In all the months that followed, Winn never lost this sound, near or far; it was always with him, seldom shattering and harsh, but always sounding as if something were being broken gradually, little by little, shaken into pieces by some invisible disintegrating power.  Winn flung open the long window which faced the bed. It led out to a small private balcony--if he had to be out on a balcony, he had of course made a point of its being private--and looked over all Davos.  The lights were nearly gone now. Only two or three twinkled in a narrow circle on a sheet of snow; behind them the vague shapes of the mountains hung immeasurably alien and at peace.  A bell rang out through the still air with a deep, reverberating note. It was a reassuring and yet solemn sound, as if it alone were responsible for humanity, for all the souls crowded together in the tiny valley, striving for their separate, shaken, inconclusive lives.  ""An odd place--Davos,"" Winn thought to himself. ""No idea it was like this. Sort of mix up between a picnic and a cemetery!""  And then suddenly somebody laughed. The sound came from a slope of mountain behind the hotel, and through the dark Winn's quick ear caught the sound of a light rushing across the snow. Some one must be tobogganing out there, some one very young and gay and incorrigibly certain of joy. Winn hoped he should hear Peter laughing like that later on. It was such a jolly boy's laugh, low, with a mischievous chuckle in it, elated, and very disarming.  He hoped the child wouldn't get hauled up for being out so late and making a noise. He smiled as he thought that the owner of the voice, even if collared, would probably be up to getting out of his trouble; and when he turned in, he was still smiling.     CHAPTER XI   Dr. Gurnet's house was like an eye, or a pair of super-vigilant eyes, stationed between Davos Dorf and Davos Platz.  It stood, a small brown chalet, perched high above the lake. There was nothing on either side of it but the snows, the sunshine, and the sense of its vigilance; inside, from floor to ceiling, there were neat little cases with the number of the year, and in each year there was a complete, exhaustive, and entertaining history of those who wintered, unaware of its completion and entertainment, in either of the villages. No eye but his own saw these documents, but no secret policeman ever so controlled the inner workings of a culprit's mind. There was nothing in Dr. Gurnet himself that led one to believe in his piercing quality. He was a stout little man, with a high-domed, bald head, long arms, short legs, and whitish blue eyes which had the quality of taking in everything they saw without giving anything out.  Sometimes they twinkled, but the twinkle was in most cases for his own consumption; he disinfected even his jokes so that they were never catching. The consulting-room contained no medical books. There were two book-shelves, on one side psychology from the physical point of view, and in the other bookcase, psychology as understood by the leading lights of the Catholic religion.  Dr. Gurnet was fond of explaining to his more intelligent patients that here you had the two points of view.  ""Psychology is like alcohol,"" he observed; ""you may have it with soda-water or without. Religion is the soda-water.""  Two tiger skins lay on the floor. Dr. Gurnet was a most excellent shot. He was too curious for fear, though he always asserted that he disliked danger, and took every precaution to avoid it, excepting, of course, giving up the thing which he had set out to do. But it was a fact that his favorites among his patients were, as a rule, those who loved danger for its own sake without curiosity and without fear.  He saw at a glance that Winn belonged to this category. Names were like pocket electric lamps to Dr. Gurnet. He switched them on and off to illuminate the dark places of the earth. He held Winn's card in his hand and recalled that he had known a former colonel of his regiment.  ""A very distinguished officer,"" he remarked, ""of a very distinguished regiment. Probably perfectly unknown in England. England has a preference for worthless men while they live and a tenderness for them after they are dead unless corrected by other nations. It is an odd thing to me that men like Colonel Travers and yourself, for instance, care to give up your lives to an empire that is like a badly deranged stomach with a craving for unhealthy objects.""  ""We haven't got to think about it,"" said Winn. ""We keep the corner we are in quiet.""  ""Yes,"" said Dr. Gurnet sympathetically, ""I know; but I think it would be better if you had to think about it. Perhaps it wouldn't be necessary to keep things quiet if they were more thoroughly exposed to thought.""  Winn's attention wandered to the tiger skins.  ""Did you bag those fellows yourself?"" he asked. Dr. Gurnet smilingly agreed. After this Winn didn't so much mind having his chest examined.  But the examination of his chest, though a long and singularly thorough operation, seemed to Dr. Gurnet a mere bead strung on an extended necklace. He hadn't any idea, as the London specialist had had, that Winn could only have one organ and one interest. He came upon him with the effect of bouncing out from behind a screen with a series of funny, flat little questions. Sometimes Winn thought he was going to be angry with him, but he never was. There was a blithe impersonal touch in Dr. Gurnet, a smiling willingness to look on private histories as of less importance than last year's newspapers. It was as if he airily explained to his patients that really they had better put any facts there were on the files, and let the housemaid use the rest for the kitchen fire; and he required very little on Winn's part. From a series of reluctant monosyllables he built up a picturesque and reliable structure of his new patient's life. They weren't by any means all physical questions. He wanted to know if Winn knew German. Winn said he didn't, and added that he didn't like Germans.  ""Then you should take some pains to understand them,"" observed Dr. Gurnet. ""Not to understand the language of an enemy is the first step toward defeat. Why, it is even necessary sometimes to understand one's friends.""  Winn said that he had a friend he understood perfectly; his name was Lionel Drummond.  ""I know him through and through,"" he explained; ""that's why I trust him."" Dr. Gurnet looked interested, but not convinced.  ""Ah,"" he said, ""personally I shouldn't trust any man till he was dead. You know where you are then, you know. Before that one prophesies. By the by, are you married?"" Dr. Gurnet did not raise his eyes at this question, but before Winn's leaden ""Yes"" had answered him he had written on the case paper, ""Unhappy domestic life.""  ""And--er--your wife's not here with you?"" Dr. Gurnet suavely continued. Winn thought himself non-committal when he confined himself to saying:  ""No; she's in England with my boy."" He was as non-committal for Dr. Gurnet as if he had been a wild elephant. He admitted Peter with a change of voice, and asked eagerly if things with lungs were hereditary or catching?  ""Not at present in your case,"" Dr. Gurnet informed him. ""By the by, you'll get better, you know. You're a little too old to cure, but you'll patch up.""  ""What does that mean?"" Winn demanded. ""Shall I be a broken-winded, cats'-meat hack?""  Dr. Gurnet shook his head.  ""You can go back to your regiment,"" he said, ""and do anything you like bar pig-sticking and polo in a year's time. That is to say, if you do as you are told for that year and will have the kindness to remember that, if you do not, I am not responsible, nor shall I be in any great degree inconsolable. I am here like a sign-post; my part of the business is to point the road. I really don't care if you follow it or not; but I should be desolated, of course, if you followed it and didn't arrive. This, however, has not yet occurred to me.  ""You will be out of doors nine hours a day, and kindly fill in this card for me. You may skate, but not ski or toboggan, nor take more than four hours' active exercise out of the twenty-four. In a month's time I shall be pleased to see you. Remember about the German and--er--do you ever flirt?""  Winn stared ominously.  ""Flirt? No,"" he said. ""Why the devil should I?""  Dr. Gurnet gave a peculiar little smile, half quizzical and half kindly.  ""Well,"" he said, ""I sometimes recommend it to my patients in order that they may avoid the intenser application known as falling in love. Or in cases like your own, for instance, when a considerable amount of beneficial cheerfulness may be arrived at by a careful juxtaposition of the sexes. You follow me?""  ""No, hanged if I do,"" said Winn. ""I've told you I'm married, haven't I? Besides, I dislike women.""  ""Ah, there perhaps we may be more in agreement than you imagine,"" said Dr. Gurnet, increasing his kindly smile. ""But I must continue to assure you that this avoidance of what you dislike is a hazardous operation. The study of women at a distance is both amusing and instructive. I grant you that too close personal relations are less so. I have avoided family life most carefully from this consideration, but much may be obtained from women without going to extremes. In fact, if I may say so, women impart their most favorable attributes solely under these conditions. Good morning.""  Winn left the small brown house with a heart that was strangely light. Of course he didn't believe in doctors any more than Sir Peter did, but he found himself believing that he was going to get well.  All the morning he had been moving his mind in slow waves that did not seem like thoughts against the rock of death; but he came away from the tiger-skins and the flickering laughter of Dr. Gurnet's eyes with a comfortable sense of having left all such questions on the doorstep. He thought instead of whether it was worth while to go down to the rink before lunch or not.  It was while he was still undecided as to this question that he heard a little shriek of laughter. It ran up a scale like three notes on a flute; he knew in a moment that it was the same laughter he had listened to the night before.  He turned aside and found himself at the bend of a long ice run leading down to the lake. A group of men were standing there, and with one foot on a toboggan, her head flung back, her eyes full of sparkling mischief, was the child. He forgot that he had ever thought her a boy, though she looked on the whole as if she would like to be thought one. Her curly auburn hair was short and very thick, and perched upon it was a round scarlet cap; her mouth was scarlet; her eyes were like Scotch braes, brown and laughing; the curves of her long, delicate lips ran upward; her curving thin, black eyebrows were like question-marks; her chin was tilted upward like the petal of a flower. She was very slim, and wore a very short brown skirt which revealed the slenderest of feet and ankles; a sweater clung to her unformed, lithe little figure. She had an air of pointed sharpness and firmness like a lifted sword. She might have been sixteen, though she was, as a matter of fact, three years older; but she was not so much an age as a sensation--the sensation of youth, incredibly arrogant and unharmed. The men were trying to dissuade her from the run. It had just been freshly iced; the long blue line of it curved as hard as iron in and out under banks of ice far down into the valley. A tall boy beside her, singularly like her in features and coloring, but weaker in fiber and expression, said querulously:  ""Don't go and make a fool of yourself, Claire. It's a man's run, not a girl's. I won't have you do it."" It was the fatal voice of authority without power.  Across the group her eyes met Winn's; wicked and gay they ran over him and into him. He stuck his hands into his pockets and stared back at her grimly, like a Staines. He wasn't going to say anything; only if she had belonged to him he would have stopped her. His eyes said he could have stopped her; but she didn't belong to him, so he set his square jaw, and gave her his unflinching, indifferent disapproval.  She appeared after this to be unaware of him, and turned to her brother.  ""Won't have it?"" she said, with a little gurgle of laughter. ""Why, how do you suppose you can stop me? There's only one way of keeping a man's run for men, and that's for girls not to be able to use it--see!""  She slipped her teasing foot off the toboggan and with an agile twist of her small body sprang face downward on the board. In an instant she was off, lying along it light as a feather, but holding the runners in a grip of steel. In a moment more she was nothing but a traveling black dot far down the valley, lifting to the banks, swirling lightning swift back into the straight in a series of curves and flashes, till at the end the toboggan, girl and all, swung high into the air, and subsided safely into a snow-drift.  Winn turned and walked away; he wasn't going to applaud her. Something burned in his heart, grave and angry, stubborn and very strong. It was as if a strange substance had got into him, and he couldn't in the least have said what it was. It voiced itself for him in his saying to himself, ""That girl wants looking after."" The men on the bank admired her; there were too many of them, and no woman. He wondered if he should ever see her again. She was curiously vivid to him--brown shoes and stockings, tossed hair, clear eyes. He remembered once going to an opera and being awfully bored because there was such a lot of stiff music and people bawling about; only on the stage there had been a girl lying in the middle of a ring of flames. She'd showed up uncommonly well, rather like this one did in the hot sunshine.  Walking back to the hotel he met a string of bounders, people he had seen and loathed at breakfast. Some of them had tried to talk to him; one beggar had had the cheek to ask Winn what he was up there for, and when Winn had said, ""Not to answer impertinent questions,"" things at the breakfast-table--there was one confounded long one for breakfast--had fallen rather flat.  He felt sure he wouldn't see the girl again; only he did almost at once. She came into the _salle-a-manger_ with her brother, as if it belonged to them. After two stormy, obstinate scenes Winn had obtained the shelter of his separate and solitary table. The waiter approached the two young things as they entered late and a little flushed; apparently he explained to them with patient stubbornness that they, at any rate, must give up this privilege; they couldn't have a separate table. He also tried to persuade them which one to join. The boy made a blustering assertion of himself and then subsided. Claire Rivers did neither. Her eyes ran over the room, mutinous and a little disdainful; then she moved. It seemed to Winn he had never seen anybody move so lightly and so swiftly. There was no faltering in her. She took the room with her head up like a sail before a breeze. She came straight to Winn's table and looked down at him.  ""This is ours,"" she said. ""You've taken it, though we were here first. Do you think it's fair?""  Winn rose quietly and looked down at her. He was glad he was half a head taller; still he couldn't look very far down. She caught at the corner of her lip with a small white tooth. He tried to make a look of sternness come into his eyes, but he felt guiltily aware that he wanted to give in to her, just as he wanted to give in, to Peter.  ""Of course,"" he said, gravely, ""I had no idea it was your table when I got it from that tow-headed fool. You must take it at once, and I'll make him bring in another one.""  ""He won't,"" said Claire. ""He says he can't; Herr Avalon, the proprietor, won't give him another; besides, there isn't room.""  ""Oh, I think he will,"" said Winn. ""Shall I go over and bring your brother to you? Won't you sit down?""  She hesitated, then she said:  ""You make me feel as if I were being very rude, and I don't want to drive you away. Only, you know, the other people here are rather awful, aren't they?""  Winn was aware that their entire awfulness was concentrated upon his companion.  ""Please sit down,"" he said a little authoritatively. Her brother ought to have backed her up, but the young fool wouldn't; he stood shamefacedly over by the door. ""I'll get hold of your brother,"" Winn added, turning away from her. The waiter hovered nervously in their direction.  ""Am I to set for the three, sir?"" he ventured. Claire turned quickly toward Winn.  ""Yes,"" she said; ""why not? If you don't mind, I mean. You aren't really a bit horrid.""  ""How can you possibly tell?"" Winn asked, with a short laugh. ""However, I'll get your brother, and if you really don't mind, I'll come back with him.""  Claire was quite sure that she could tell and that she didn't mind.  The waiter came back in triumph, but Winn gave him a sharp look which extracted his triumph as neatly as experts extract a winkle with a pin. Maurice apologized with better manners than Winn had expected. He looked a terribly unlicked cub, and Winn found himself watching anxiously to see if Claire ate enough and the right things. He couldn't, of course, say anything if she didn't, but he found himself watching.     CHAPTER XII   Winn was from the first sure that it was perfectly all right. She wouldn't notice him at all. She would merely look upon him as the man who was there when there were skates to clean, skis to oil, any handy little thing which the other fellows, being younger and not feeling so like an old nurse, might more easily overlook. Women liked fellows who cut a dash, and you couldn't cut a dash and be an old nurse simultaneously. Winn clung to the simile of the old nurse. That was, after all the real truth of his feelings, not more than that, certainly not love. Love would make more of a figure in the world, not that it mattered what you called things provided you behaved decently. Only he was glad he was not in love.  He bought her flowers and chocolates, though he had a pang about the chocolates, not feeling quite sure that they were good for her; but flowers were safe.  He didn't give her lilies--they seemed too self-consciously virginal, as if they wanted to rub it in--he gave her crimson roses, flowers that frankly enjoyed themselves and were as beautiful as they could be. They were like Claire herself. She never stopped to consider an attitude; she just went about flowering all over the place in a kind of perpetual fragrance.  She enjoyed herself so much that she simply hadn't time to notice any one in particular. There were a dozen men always about her. She was so young and happy and unintentional that every one wanted to be with her. It was like sitting in the sun.  She never muddled things up or gave needless pain or cheated. That was what Winn liked about her. She was as fair as a judge without being anything like so grave.  They were all playing a game, and she was the leader. They would have let her break the rules if she had wanted to break them! but she wouldn't have let herself.  Of course the hotel didn't approve of her; no hotel could be expected to approve of a situation which it so much enjoyed. Besides Claire was lawless; she kept her own rules, but she broke everybody else's. She never sought a chaperon or accepted some older woman's sheltering presence; she never sat in the ladies' salon or went to tea with the chaplain's wife. On one dreadful occasion she tobogganed wilfully on a Sunday, under the chaplain's nose, with a man who had arrived only the night before.  When old Mrs. Stewart, who knitted regularly by the winter and counted almost as many scandals as stitches, took her up on the subject out of kindness of heart, Claire had said without meaning to be rude:  ""I really don't think the chaplain's nose ought to be there, to _be_ under, do you?""  Of course, Mrs. Stewart did. She had the highest respect for the chaplain's nose; but it wasn't the kind of subject you could argue about.  For a long time Claire and Winn never really talked; she threw words at him over her shoulder or in the hall or when he put her skates on or took them off at the rink. He seemed to get there quicker than any one else, though the operation itself was sometimes a little prolonged. Of course there were meals, but meals belonged to Maurice, and Claire had a way of always slipping behind him, so that it was really over the skates that Winn discovered how awfully clever she was.  She read books, deep books; why, even Hall Caine and Marie Corelli didn't satisfy her, and Winn had always thought those famous authors the last words in modern literature. He now learned others. She gave him Conrad to read, and Meredith. He got stuck in Meredith, but he liked Conrad; it made him smell the mud and feel again the silence of the jungle.  ""Funny,"" he explained to Claire, ""because when you come to think of it, he doesn't actually write about the smell; only he's got it, and the jungle feeling, too. It's quiet, you know, in there, but not a bit like the snows out here; there's nothing doing up in this snow, but God alone knows what's happening in the jungle. Odd how there can be two sorts of quiet, ain't it?""  ""There can be two sorts of anything,"" said Claire, exultantly. ""Oh, not only two--dozens; that's why it's all such fun.""  But Winn was inclined to think that there might be more fun where there were fewer candidates for it. There was, for instance, Mr. Roper. Maurice was trying to work up for his final examination at Sandhurst with Mr. Roper. He was a black-haired, polite man with a constant smile and a habit of agreeing with people much too promptly; also he read books and talked to Claire about them in the evening till every one started bridge. Fortunately, that shut him up.  Winn was considered in Anglo-Indian clubs, where the standard of bridge is high, to play considerably above it, and Claire played with a relish, that was more instinctive than reliable; nevertheless, Winn loved playing with her, and accepted Mr. Roper and Maurice as one accepts severity of climate on the way to a treat. He knew he must keep his temper with them both, so when he wanted to be nasty he looked at Claire, and when Claire looked at him he wanted to be nice. He couldn't, of course, stop Claire from ever in any circumstances glancing in the direction of Mr. Roper, and it would have startled him extremely if he had discovered that Claire, seeing how much he disliked it, had reduced this form of communion to the rarest civility; because Winn still took for granted the fact that Claire noticed nothing.  It was the solid earth on which he stood. For some months his consciousness of his wife had been an intermittent recognition of a disagreeable fact; but for the first few weeks at Davos he forgot Estelle entirely; she drifted out of his mind with the completeness of a collar stud under a wardrobe.  He never for a moment forgot Peter, but he didn't talk about him because it would have seemed like boasting. Even if he had said, ""I have a boy called Peter,"" it would have sounded as if nobody else had ever had a boy like Peter. Besides, he didn't want to talk about himself; he wanted to talk about Claire.  She hadn't time to tell him much; she was preparing for a skating competition, which took several hours a day, and then in the afternoons she skied or tobogganed with Mr. Ponsonby, a tall, lean Eton master getting over an illness. Winn privately thought that if Mr. Ponsonby was well enough to toboggan, he was well enough to go back and teach boys; but this opinion was not shared by Mr. Ponsonby, who greatly preferred staying where he was and teaching Claire.  Claire tobogganed and skied with the same thrill as she played bridge and skated; they all seemed to her breathless and vital duties. She did not think of Mr. Ponsonby as much as she did of the toboggan, but he gave her points. In any case, Winn preferred him to Mr. Roper, who was obliged to teach Maurice in the afternoons.  If one wants very much to learn a particular subject, it is surprising how much of it one may pick up in the course of a day from chance moments.  In a week Winn had learned that Maurice and Claire were orphans, that they lived with an aunt who didn't get on with Claire and an uncle who didn't get on with Maurice, and that there were several cousins too stodgy for words. Claire was waiting for Maurice to get through Sandhurst--he'd been horribly interrupted by pleurisy--and then she could keep house for him somewhere--wherever he was sent--unless she took up a profession. She rather thought she was going to do that in any case, because they would have awfully little money; and besides, not doing things was a bore, and every girl ought to make her way in the world, didn't Major Staines think so?  Major Staines didn't, and emphatically said that he didn't.  ""Good God, no! What on earth for?"" was how he expressed it. Claire stopped short, outside the office door, just as she was going to pay her bill.  ""We shall have to talk about this,"" she said gravely. ""I'm awfully afraid you're a reactionary.""  ""I dare say I am,"" said Winn, who hadn't the faintest idea what a reactionary was, but rather liked the sound of it. ""We'll talk about it as much as you like. How about lunch at the Schatz Alp?""  That was how they went to the Schatz Alp and had their first real talk.     CHAPTER XIII   Claire was not perfectly sure of life--it occurred to her at nineteen that it might have in store for her certain surprises--but she was perfectly sure of herself. She knew that she ought to have been a boy, and that if she had been a boy she would have tried to be like General Gordon. Balked of this ambition by the fact of her sex, she turned her attention to Maurice.  It seemed to her essential that he should be like General Gordon in her place, and by dint of persuasion, concentration of purpose, and sheer indomitable will power she infected Maurice with the same idea. He had made her no promises, but he had agreed to enter the army.  It is improbable that General Gordon's character was formed wholly by the exertions of his sister, but Claire in her eagerness rather overlooked the question of material. There was nothing in Maurice himself that was wrong, but he belonged to a class of young men who are always being picked up by ""wrong 'uns.""  He wanted a little too much to be liked. He was quite willing to be a hero to please Claire if it was not too much trouble. Meanwhile he expected it to be compatible with drinking rather more than was good for him, spending considerably too much money, and talking loudly and knowingly upon subjects considered doubtful.  If the world had been as innocent as Maurice, this program would in time have corrected itself. But besides holes and the unwary, there are from time to time diggers of holes, and it was to these unsound guides that Maurice found himself oftenest attracted.  What he asked of Claire was that she should continue to believe in him and make his way easy for him. She could fight for his freedom with a surly uncle, but having won it, she shouldn't afterward expect a fellow to do things with it which would end in his being less free.  Maurice really loved Claire, his idea of love being that he would undeviatingly choose her to bear all his burdens. She managed the externals of his life with the minimum of exertion to himself. She fought his guardians; she talked straight to his opposers; she took buffets that were meant for him to take; she made plans, efforts, and arrangements for his comfort. Lots of things he wanted he could simply not have had if she had failed to procure them.  Pushed beyond a certain point Maurice gave in, or appeared to give in, and lied. Claire never admitted even to herself that Maurice lied, but she took unusual pains to prevent his ever being pushed beyond a certain point.  It was Claire who had managed the journey to Davos in the teeth of opposition; but it was Maurice who would have no other guide than Mr. Roper, a splendid army coach picked up at a billiard room in a hotel. Now that they were at Davos, Claire became a little doubtful if, after all, her uncle hadn't been right when he had declared that Bournemouth would have done as well and been far less expensive. Then Winn came, and she began mysteriously to feel that the situation was saved.  It wasn't that Winn looked in the least like General Gordon, but Mr. Ponsonby had told her that he was a distinguished officer and shot tigers on foot.  Claire was quite surprised that Winn had been so nice to her, particularly as he hadn't appeared at all a friendly kind of person; but she became more and more convinced that Winn was a knight errant in disguise and had been sent by heaven to her direct assistance.  Claire believed very strongly in heaven. If you have no parents and very disagreeable relatives, heaven becomes extremely important. Claire didn't think it was at all the place her aunt and uncle vaguely held out to her as a kind of permanent and compulsory pew into which an angelic verger conducted the more respectable after death.  Everything Mr. and Mrs. Tighe considered the laws of God seemed to Claire unlikely to be the laws of anybody except people like Mr. and Mrs. Tighe; but she did believe that God looked after Maurice and herself, and she was anxious that He should look particularly after Maurice.  She determined that on the day she went to the Schatz Alp with Major Staines she would take him into her confidence. She could explain the position of women to him while they climbed the Rhueti-Weg; this would give them all of lunch for Maurice's future, and she hoped without direct calculations--because, although Claire generally had very strong purposes, she seldom had calculations--that perhaps if she was lucky he would tell her about tigers on the way down.  It was one of those mornings at Davos which seemed made out of fragrance and crystal. The sun soaked into the pines, the sky above the tree-tops burned like blue flame. It was the first time in Claire's life that she had gone out all by herself to lunch with a grown-up man. Winn was far more important than a mere boy, besides being a major.  She had been planning all the morning during her skating what arguments she should use to Winn on the subject of women, but when she saw him in the hall everything went out of her head. She only knew that it was a heavenly day and that it seemed extraordinarily difficult not to dance.  It was a long walk up to the Schatz Alp; there were paths where the pine-trees met overhead, garlanded with wreaths of snow, and the spaces between the wreaths were as blue as love-in-a-mist, an old-fashioned flower that grows in English gardens. Claire pointed it out to Winn.  ""Only,"" she said, ""up here there isn't any mist, is there?""  ""No,"" said Winn, looking at her in a curious way; ""as far as I can see, there is none whatever. By the by, that particular flower you mention isn't only called love-in-a-mist, it's also called devil-in-a-bush.""  ""But that's a pity,"" said Claire, decisively. ""I like the other name better.""  She moved beside him with a buoyant, untiring step, without haste and without effort. He told her that he would like to take her up into the Himalayas. She would make a good climber. In his heart he knew there was no place on earth to which he wouldn't like to take her. She was born to be a man's comrade, observant, unexacting, level-headed. She was the kind of girl you wouldn't mind seeing in a tight place if you were there, of course, to get her out of it. Then he pulled himself up and told himself not to be fanciful.  It was rather a fanciful morning: the day and the snowy hillside and the endless, pungent sweetness of the sunny air were like a spell. He found he was telling Claire about the things he used to do when he was a boy. He went on doing it because the adventures of the Staines family made her laugh.  He had not supposed that James, Charles, Isabella, Dolores, and he himself were particularly funny before, but he was delighted to discover their hidden gift. Claire wanted to hear everything about them, their ponies, their dogs, their sharp disgraces, and their more wonderful escapes and revenges; but she didn't want them to be punished, and Winn had to hasten over those frequent and usually protracted disasters.  They had the woods to themselves; there was no sound at all except the occasional soft drop of melting snow. Once they stood quite still holding their breath to watch the squirrels skim from tree to tree as if they were weaving the measures of a mystic dance. If it hadn't been for the squirrels they might have been the only creatures alive in all the silent, sparkling earth.  The mountains spread out around them with the reticent hush of interrupted consciousness. They seemed to be on the verge of further revelations, and were withheld from a last definite whisper only by the intrusion of humanity.  ""I know they could speak if they liked,"" Claire murmured. ""What do you suppose they'd say?""  ""Let's have an avalanche and knock the silly blighters out of our valley for good and all,"" Winn suggested.  Claire disposed of Davos with a wave of her hand.  ""But they don't mind us, do they?"" she urged. ""Because we're so happy and we like them so. Doesn't the air make you feel awfully funny and happy?""  ""Yes,"" Winn admitted; ""but it's not all the air, you know.""  Claire wanted to know what else it was; but as Winn didn't offer to explain, she felt that perhaps she had better not ask.  They were near the top when Winn paused suddenly and said in a most peculiar reluctant voice; ""Look here, I think I ought to tell you.""  He stumbled over the words and then added, ""No, by Jove, that won't do!""  ""Oh, don't let's tell each other things we ought!"" Claire entreated. ""It's not the kind of morning for that. I meant to talk about lots of really important subjects, but I'm not going to now. I may later, of course; but just now I don't feel in the mood for being important.""  Winn looked at her very hard, and then he said:  ""But still you are rather important, you know.""  ""Then,"" she laughed, ""I'm important enough to have my own way, aren't I?""  Winn said nothing. He seemed to acquiesce that she was important enough for that.  ""Would you like to know,"" she asked, ""what I'd really like for lunch?"" Winn said he would awfully, and by the time she had told him they had reached the top, and the funicular appeared, disgorging people in front of a big glass-covered restaurant.  Winn found the best and quietest table with the finest view. From it they could see the valley down to Frauenkirch and up to Clavedel.  It was a splendid lunch, curiously good, with sparkling sweet wine, which Claire loved, and Winn, secretly loathing, serenely shared because of a silly feeling he had that he must take what she did.  After lunch they sat and smoked, leaning over the great clear view. They could hear the distant velvety boom of the village clock beneath them. Winn gripped his hand firmly on the table.  ""I've got to damned well do it,"" he said to himself. He remembered that he had had once to shoot a spy in cold blood, and that he used those words to himself before he did it.  A couple passed close to their table. The woman was over-dressed, and hung with all kinds of jingling chains and bangles; she was pretty, and as she sat with her profile turned a little toward them she was curiously like Estelle. This was his opportunity. It must come now; all the morning it had lain in the back of his mind, behind delight, behind their laughter, like some lurking jungle creature waiting for the dark.  ""Do you see that woman,"" he asked Claire, ""the pretty one over there by the pillar? She's awfully like--""  Claire stopped him. ""Pretty!"" she cried. ""Do you really think she's pretty? I think she's simply loathsome!""  Winn checked himself hurriedly; he obviously couldn't finish his sentence with ""she's awfully like my wife.""  ""Well, she sets out to be pretty, doesn't she?"" he altered it rather lamely. Claire continued extremely scornful.  ""Yes, I dare say,"" she admitted. ""She may set out to be smart too, hung round with things like a Christmas-tree, but she's as common as a sixpenny bazaar. I'll tell you why I don't like her, Major Staines, and who she reminds me of, but perhaps you think her pretty, too? I mean that horrid woman, Mrs. Bouncing in our hotel?""  ""But can't horrid women be pretty, too?"" Winn ventured with meekness.  ""No, of course not,"" said Claire, with great decisiveness. ""Why, you know horrid men can't be handsome. Look at Mr. Roper!"" Winn was uncertain if this point of knowledge had ever reached him; but he wasn't at this time of day going to look at Mr. Roper, so he gave in.  ""I dare say you're right,"" he said. ""As a matter of fact, you know, I never _do_ look at Roper.""  ""But that's not the reason,"" Claire went on, slightly softened by her victory, ""that I dislike her. I really dislike her because I think she is bad for Maurice; but perhaps you haven't noticed the way he keeps hanging about her. It makes me sick.""  Winn admitted that he had noticed it.  ""Still,"" he said, ""of course if you hadn't proved to me that by being horrid she couldn't be pretty, I should have supposed that he simply hung about Mrs. Bouncing because she was--well, not precisely plain.""  Claire looked doubtfully at him, but he wasn't smiling; he was merely looking at her with sufficient attention.  ""There are only two of us,"" she said in a low voice, ""Maurice and me, and I do so awfully want him to be a success. I don't think anybody else does. I don't even know how much he wants it himself. You see, Maurice is so young in many ways, and our people having died--he hasn't had much of a chance, has he? Men ought to have fathers.""  Winn listened intently; he always remembered anything she said, but this particular opinion sank deep into the bottom of his heart: ""Men ought to have fathers.""  ""I've done the best I can,"" Claire went on, ""but you see, I'm young, too; there are lots of things I don't really know about life. I think perhaps I sometimes believe too much that things are going to be jolly, and that makes me a bad adviser for Maurice. Do you know what I mean?""  Winn nodded, but he determined that whether she expected or not, she should have things jolly. He must be able to manage it. If one wanted a thing as much as he wanted this, surely one could bring it off.  Hadn't he pulled off races on the scratchiest of polo ponies, when he couldn't afford better, out of sheer intention? He had meant to win, moved the pony along, and won. Was life less controllable than a shoddy polo pony?  He set his mouth and stared grimly out over the sparkling snow. He did not ask himself how a man with a wife hung round his neck like a millstone was going to manage the perpetual happiness of a stray young woman. He never asked himself questions or saw how things were to be done, but when the crisis came his instinct taught him in a flash the short cut to victory.  ""Now,"" said Claire, unexpectedly, ""you are looking awfully dangerous--you do rather sometimes, you know--like a kind of volcano that might go off.""  Winn turned his eyes slowly toward her.  ""I shall never be dangerous for you, Miss Rivers,"" he said gently.  He did not know how much he promised her or that he was already incapable of keeping his promise. She looked away from him with smiling lips and happy, mysterious eyes. She had known long ago that all the force he had was as safe with her as if he had laid it in her hands; safer than that, because he held it in his own--for her.  It seemed to Claire that you were only perfectly secure when you were with a man who could be dangerous to everybody else, but always safe for you.  ""You will help me with Maurice?"" she said softly. ""Then I sha'n't feel worried any more.""  ""I shouldn't let it worry me for a moment if I were you,"" Winn assured her. ""He hasn't come to much harm so far. He's young, that's all. I'll keep my eye on him, of course.""  Winn knew quite well what he would do with a subaltern of Maurice's type. He would take him out shooting and put the fear of God into him. If this were done often and systematically enough, the subaltern would improve or send in his papers. But Davos did not offer equal advantages. One could not get the fear of God everywhere on a tap; besides, there was Mrs. Bouncing.  Claire turned suddenly toward him.  ""I want Maurice,"" she said rather breathlessly, with shining eyes, ""to be a good soldier; I want him to be like you.""  Winn felt a pang of fear; it was a pang that was half horrible pain, and half passionate and wild delight. Was Claire perfectly safe? Why did she want Maurice to be like him? It was Claire herself who banished his fear; she added hastily:  ""He really must get through Sandhurst properly.""  Of course she hadn't meant anything. In fact, if she really had liked him in any particular way she'd have been shot before she showed it. What she wanted was simply the advice of an older man in the service. It did not occur to Winn that Claire had been shot already without knowing it.  He went on being reassured all the way back because Claire talked persistently about tigers. Winn explained that once you thoroughly knew where you were, there was no real danger in a tiger.     PART II     CHAPTER XIV   Winn discovered almost immediately that what assistance he could give to Maurice would have to be indirect. He had not a light hand for weak, evasive, and excitable people, and Maurice did not like to be driven off the rink with ""Better come along with me"" or ""I should think a good brisk walk to Clavedel would be about your mark."" Winn's idea of a walk was silence and pace; he had a poor notion of small talk, and he became peculiarly dumb with a young man whose idea of conversation was high-pitched boasting.  When Maurice began telling stories about how he got the better of so-and-so or the length of his ski-jumps, Winn's eyes became unpleasantly like probes, and Maurice felt the elan of his effects painfully ebbing away. Still, there was a certain honor in being sought out by the most exclusive person in the hotel and Winn's requests, stated in flat terms and with the force of his determination behind them, were extraordinarily difficult to refuse.  It was Mr. Roper who gave Maurice the necessary stiffening. Mr. Roper didn't like Winn, and though their intercourse had been limited to a series of grunts on Winn's part, Mr. Roper felt something unerringly inimical behind each of these indeterminate sounds.  ""That man's a spoil-sport,"" he informed his pupil. Maurice agreed.  ""But he's beastly difficult to say no to,"" he added. ""You mean to somehow, but you don't.""  ""I expect he's trying to manage you,"" Mr. Roper cleverly hinted.  This decided Maurice once and for all. He refused all further invitations. He had a terror of being managed, and though he always was managed, gusts of this fear would seize upon him at any effort to influence him in any direction favorable to himself. He was never in the least uneasy at being managed to his disadvantage.  Baffled in his main direction, Winn turned his mind upon the subject of Mr. Roper. Mr. Roper was slippery and intensely amiable; these were not the qualities with which Winn felt himself capable of direct dealing. He would have liked to destroy Mr. Roper, and he thought that the situation might eventually arrive at this point; but until it did, he saw that he had better leave Mr. Roper alone. ""You can't do anything with a worm but tread on it,"" he said to himself, and in hotels people had to be careful how they trod on worms. There was still Mrs. Bouncing, but a slight study of that lady, which took place in the hall after dinner, put this possibility out of the question. She called Winn a ""naughty man"" and suggested his taking her tobogganing by moonlight.  Mr. Bouncing was a side issue, but Winn, despite his own marriage, held the theory that men ought to look after their wives. He felt that if there had been any question of other men he could have managed Estelle; or, even short of managing Estelle, he could have managed the other men. It occurred to him now that perhaps Mr. Bouncing could be led to act favorably upon the question of his wife's behavior.  Mr. Bouncing could not walk at all; he could get out to the public balcony in the sun, and when he was there, he lay with the ""Pink 'Un"" and ""The Whipping Post"" on his lap and his thermometer beside him. All he asked was that he should have his hot milk regularly four times a day. He hardly talked to anybody at all. This was not because it made him cough to talk--it didn't particularly; he coughed without being made to--but because he had exhausted his audience.  There was only one subject left to Mr. Bouncing, and that was his health; after he had told people all his symptoms, they didn't want to hear any more and there was nothing left to talk about. So he lay there in the sunshine thinking about his symptoms instead. There were a good many of them to think about, and all of them were bad.  Mr. Bouncing was surprised when Winn sat down to talk to him, and he explained to him at once exactly what the doctors thought of his case. Winn listened passively, and came back the next day at the same time.  This surprised Mr. Bouncing still more, and little by little the subjects between them widened. Mr. Bouncing still talked about himself, but he talked differently. He told Winn things he had never told any one else, and he was really pleased when Winn laughed at a joke he showed him in ""The Pink 'Un.""  ""You can laugh,"" he said almost admiringly. ""I daren't, you know; that's one of the things I'm told not to do, but I often wish some one would come here and laugh at the jokes for me. It's quite an effort for me sometimes not to burst out; and then, you see, hemorrhage! I knew a poor chap who literally died of it--died of laughing. They might put that in the 'Pink 'Un,' mightn't they?""  Winn said he thought one might die of worse things.  ""Yes, I know,"" agreed Mr. Bouncing, ""but I'm not going to be caught like that. I dare say you don't know, but I believe I'm the worst case in the hotel. I'm not _quite_ sure; that's what worries me. There's a Mrs. Maguire who stays in bed. I've made all sorts of inquiries about her; but people are so stupid, they don't know the right symptoms to ask about, and I can't go in and look at her, can I? And my wife won't. She says one death's-head is enough for her and I quite see her point. Perhaps Mrs. Maguire's case is partly nerves. My wife thinks I'm very nervous. So I am, you know, in a way. I have to be careful; but, Lord! when I see the things people do up here! The risks they take! You, for instance. I've seen you do heaps of things that are perfectly deadly; and yet there you are getting better. Funny, isn't it?""  Winn said it was funny, but he supposed one must take his chance.  ""Yes, I know; that is what people keep saying,"" Mr. Bouncing admitted. ""You can take it if you've got it; but my point is, if you haven't got it, you can't take it, can you? Now, as far as I can see, looking back from the start, you know, I never had a dog's chance. It's years since I went out in a wind without an overcoat on, and once in the very beginning I got my feet wet; but for the last five years I've been as careful as a girl with a new hat. I think I shall live till the spring if I don't get influenza. I hope you'll remember not to come near me if you feel a cold coming on."" Winn assured him that he would. ""I asked Dr. Gurnet the other day,"" Mr. Bouncing went on musingly, ""if he thought I should ever be able to walk to the post-office again--I used to get there and back last winter, you know--but he wouldn't give me a direct answer. He said he thought I could rely on the hotel porter. He's not quite definite enough--Dr. Gurnet. I told him the other day how difficult it was to get up in the morning, and he said, 'Well, then, why not stay in bed?' But I'm not going to do that. I believe you go quicker when you stay in bed. Besides, I should be dull lying there in bed. I like to sit here and watch people and see the silly things they do. That young boy you sit at table with--he won't come to any good. Silly! He thinks my wife likes him, but she doesn't; it's just that she must have her mind taken off, you know, at times, poor thing. I like to see her amused.""  ""And what about you?"" asked Winn. ""It seems to me she might better spend some of her time amusing you.""  Mr. Bouncing pointed to the ""Pink 'Un.""  ""I've got plenty to amuse me,"" he explained, ""and you mustn't think she doesn't look after me. Why, the other day--when I had the high temperature, you know, and stayed in my room--she came to the door after she'd been skating, and said, 'Still coughing?' That shows she noticed I was worse, doesn't it?""  ""I'm sure she must be awfully anxious about you,"" Winn assented with more kindliness than truth. ""But do you care for her knocking about so with young Rivers and that chap Roper? It seems to me she's too young and too pretty. If I were you, I'd call her in a bit; I would really.""  Mr. Bouncing leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes. This always made Winn a little uneasy, for when Mr. Bouncing's eyes were shut it was so difficult to tell whether he was alive or dead. However, after a few minutes he opened them.  ""They are five minutes late with my hot milk,"" he said. ""Do you mind just getting up and touching the bell? And you've got such a sharp way of speaking to waiters, perhaps you wouldn't mind hauling him over the coals for me when he comes?"" Winn complied with this request rapidly and effectively, and the hot milk appeared as if by magic.  Mr. Bouncing drank some before he returned to the subject of his wife.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""I dare say you would call her in. You're the kind of man who can make people come in when you call. I'm not. Besides, you see, she's young; she's got her life to live, and, then, ought I to have married her at all? Of course I was wonderfully well at the time; I could walk several miles, I remember, and had no fever to speak of. Still, there were the symptoms. She took the risk, of course--she was one of a large family, and I had money--but it hasn't been very amusing for her, you must admit.""  Winn didn't admit it, because it seemed to him as if it had been extremely amusing for Mrs. Bouncing, a great deal more amusing than it had any right to be.  ""Perhaps you think she oughtn't to have married for money,"" Mr. Bouncing went on when he had finished the hot milk and Winn still sat there saying nothing. ""But you're quite wrong if you do. Money is the most important thing there is--next to health of course. Health and money--one's no use without the other, of course; but I don't honestly think anything else really matters. I know what the chaplain says; but he's always been quite strong.""  ""That's all very well,"" said Winn. ""I'm not a religious man myself, but people oughtn't to take something for nothing. If she's married you for your money, she ought to be more with you. She's got the money, hasn't she, and what have you got? That's the way I look at it.""  Mr. Bouncing did not shake his head--he was too careful for that--but he looked as if he were shaking it.  ""That's one point of view, of course,"" he said slowly; ""but how do you know I want to have her more with me? She's very young and strong. I expect she'd be exciting, and it wouldn't be at all good for me to be excited.  ""Besides, she has no sense of humor. I wouldn't dream of asking her to laugh at my jokes as I do you. She wouldn't see them, and then I shouldn't like to show her the improper ones. They're not suitable for ladies, and the improper ones are the best. I sometimes think you can't have a really good joke unless it's improper.""  Winn did not say anything; but he thought that however limited Mrs. Bouncing's sense of humor might be, she would have enjoyed the improper ones.  Mr. Bouncing took out his thermometer.  ""It is five minutes,"" he said, ""since I've had the glass of milk, and I think my tongue must have cooled down by now. So I shall take my temperature, and after that I shall try to go to sleep. But I don't believe you are really anxious about my wife; what you're worried about is young Rivers. I've seen you taking him for walks, and it's no use your worrying about him, because, as I've said before, he's silly. If he didn't do one silly thing, he'd do another. However, he's selfish, too. That's always something; he won't be so likely to come to grief as if he were merely silly. It's his sister I should be worried about if I were you.""  ""Why?"" asked Winn without looking at him. Mr. Bouncing looked at Winn, but he made no answer. He had already got his thermometer in his mouth.     CHAPTER XV   Winn had a feeling that he ought to keep away from her, but Davos was an inconvenient place for keeping away. People were always turning up when one least expected them, or one turned up oneself. Privacy and publicity flashed together in the sunny air. Even going off up a mountain with a book was hardly the resource it seemed; friends skied or tobogganed down upon you from the top, and carried you off to tea.  Winn had an uneasy feeling that he oughtn't to go every morning to the rink, though that was naturally the place for a man who was only allowed to skate to find himself. It was also the place where he could not fail to find Claire. There were a good many other skaters on the rink, too; they were all preparing for the International Skating Competition.  The English, as a rule, stuck to their own rink, where they had a style of skating belonging to themselves. Their style was perpendicular and very stiff; it was by no means easy to attain, and when attained, hardly perhaps, to the observer, worth the efforts expended. Winn approved of it highly. He thought it a smart and sensible way to skate, and was by no means a bad exponent; but once he had seen Claire skating on the big rink, he put aside his abortive circling round an orange. It is difficult to concentrate upon being a ramrod when every instinct in you desires to chase a swallow. She wore, when she skated, a short, black velvet skirt, white fox furs, and a white fur cap. One couldn't very well miss seeing her. It did not seem to Winn as if she skated at all. She skimmed from her seat into the center of her chosen corner, and then looked about her, balanced in the air. When she began to skate he could not tell whether the band was playing or not, because he felt as if she always moved to music.  She would turn at first mysteriously and doubtingly, trying her edges, with little short cuts and dashes, like a leaf blown now here and now there, pushed by a draught of air, and then some purpose seemed to catch her, and her steps grew intricate and measured. He could not take his eyes from her or remember that she was real, she looked so unsubstantial, eddying to and fro, curving and circling and swooping. There was no stiffness in her, and Winn found himself ready to give up stiffness; it was terrible the amount of things he found himself ready to give up as he watched her body move like seaweed on a tide. Motion and joy and music all seemed easy things, and the things that were not easy slipped out of his mind.  After a time Maurice would join her to practise the pair-skating. He was a clever skater, but careless, and it set Winn's teeth on edge to watch how nearly he sometimes let her down. He would have let any other woman down, but Claire knew him. She counted on his not being exactly where he ought to be, hovered longer on her return strokes, pushed herself more swiftly forward to meet him, or retreated to avoid his too impulsive rushes. Winn was always glad when Maurice, satisfied with his cursory practice, left her circling alone and unfettered like a sea-gull on a cliff.  This was the time when he always made up his mind not to join her, and felt most sure that she didn't care whether he joined her or not.  He had not talked with her alone since their lunch at the Schatz Alp nearly a week ago. Every one of her hours was full, her eyes danced and laughed as usual, the secretive bloom of youth hid away from him any sign of expectation. He did not dream that every day for a week she had expected and wanted him. She couldn't herself have explained what she wanted. Only her gaiety had lost its unconsciousness; she was showing that she didn't mind, she was not, now minding. It seemed so strange that just when she had felt as if they were real friends he had mysteriously kept away from her. Perhaps he hadn't meant all the nice things he had said or all the nicer things he hadn't said at all, but just looked whenever her eyes met his? They did not meet his now; he always seemed to be looking at something else. Other men put on her skates and found her quickest on the rink, and the other men seemed to Claire like trees walking; they were no longer full of amusing possibilities. They were in the way. Then one morning Winn, watching her from a distance noticed that Maurice didn't turn up. Claire actually looked a forlorn and lonely little figure, and he couldn't make up his mind not to join her.  He skated slowly up to her.  ""Well,"" he said, ""where's Maurice? He oughtn't to be missing a good skating morning like this?"" It suddenly seemed to Claire as if everything was all right again. Winn was there for her, just as he had been on the Schatz Alp; his eyes looked the same, and the intentional bruskness which he put into his voice was quite insufficient to hide its eagerness.  ""Oh,"" she said, ""Major Staines, I didn't mean to tell anybody, but I shall tell you of course. It's rather sickening, isn't it? Maurice doesn't want to go in for the competition any more; he says he can't spare the time.""  ""What!"" cried Winn; ""look here, let's sit down and talk about it."" They sat down, and the music and the sunshine spread out all round them. Everything swung into a curious harmony, and left them almost nothing to be upset about. ""He can't throw you over like this,"" Winn protested. ""Why, it's only a fortnight off the day, and you're one of the tiptop skaters.""  Claire did not say what she knew to be true, that people had been saying that too much to Maurice, and Maurice only liked praise that came his own way.  ""I think it's Mrs. Bouncing,"" she said dejectedly. ""He's teaching her to skate, but she'll never learn. She's been up here for years, and she doesn't know her edges! It looks awfully as if he really liked her, because Maurice skates quite well.""  ""I'm afraid I've been of very little use to you about Mrs. Bouncing,"" Winn said apologetically. ""I thought Bouncing might help us, he's quite a good chap; but I'm afraid he's too down in the mouth. Still, I think I may be able to do something if things get to look really bad. Don't worry about that, please. But, by Jove! this skating matter _is_ serious. What are you going to do about it?"" Anything that stopped sport seemed to Winn to be really serious; something had got to be done about it. ""Isn't there any one else up here not going in for it that you could lick into shape?""  Claire shook her head doubtfully.  ""They'd have to give up every bit of their time,"" she explained, ""and virtually hardly breathe. You see, pair-skating is really very stiff. Of course, if I got a new man, I'd do most of the figures; but he'd have to be there to catch me at the right times, and awfully steady on his edges, and waltz of course.""  ""What about me?"" Winn asked quietly.  ""I'm steady on my edges, and I can waltz after a fashion, and I'd promise not to breathe for a fortnight."" He looked at her, and then looked away quickly. He was a damned fool to have offered himself! How on earth was he going to stand a fortnight with her when he could barely keep himself in hand for five minutes?  ""Oh,"" she said, ""you!""  Afterward she said a good deal more, but Winn only remembered the way she said ""you,"" because her voice had sounded different, as if she had found something she had wanted to lay her hands on. Of course what she really wanted was to go in for the pair-skating; it was much the most fun.  They began from that moment to go in for it. Winn had to speak to Dr. Gurnet about the skating, because four hours wasn't enough, and Claire insisted upon Dr. Gurnet's consent.  Dr. Gurnet had consented, though he had raised his eyebrows and said, ""Pair-skating?"" and then he had asked who Major Staines had chosen for his partner. Naturally Winn had become extremely stiff, and said, ""Miss Rivers,"" in a tone which should have put an end to the subject.  ""Well, well!"" said Dr. Gurnet. ""And she's a woman, after all, isn't she?"" Winn ignored this remark.  ""By the by,"" he said, ""my friend's coming out in about a fortnight--the one I told you about, Captain Drummond.""  ""I remember perfectly,"" said Dr. Gurnet; ""a most estimable person I understand you to say. In about a fortnight? The skating competition will just be over then, won't it? I am sure I hope you and Miss Rivers will both make a great success of it.""  The fortnight passed in a sunny flash. On the whole Winn had kept himself in hand. His voice had betrayed him, his eyes had betrayed him, all his controlled and concentrated passion had betrayed him; but he hadn't said anything. He had buried his head deep in the sands and trusted like an ostrich to an infectious oblivion. He reviewed his behavior on the way to the rink the day of the International.  It was an icy cold morning; the valley was wrapped in a thick blue mist. There was no sunlight yet. The tops of the mountains were a sharpened deadly white, colder than purity. As he walked toward the valley the black fir-trees on the distant heights took fire. They seemed to be lighted one by one from some swift, invisible torch, and then quicker than sight itself the sun slipped over the edge and ran in a golden flood across the mountains. The little willows by the lake-side turned apricot; the rink was very cold and only just refrozen. It was a small gray square surrounded by color. Winn was quite alone in the silence and the light and the tingling bitter air. There was something in him that burned like a secret undercurrent of fire. Had he played the game? What about that dumb weight on his lips when he had tried to tell Claire on the Schatz Alp about Estelle? He couldn't get it out then; but had he tried again later? Had he concealed his marriage? Why should he tell her anything? She wouldn't care, she was so young. Couldn't he have his bit of spring, his dance of golden daffodils, and then darkness? He really thought of daffodils when he thought of Claire. She wouldn't mind, because she was spring itself, and had in front of her a great succession of flowers; but these were the last he was going to have. There wouldn't be anything at all after Claire, and he wasn't going to make love to her. Good God! he wasn't such a beast! There had been times this last fortnight that had tried every ounce of his self-control, and he hadn't touched her. He hadn't said a word that damned yellow-necked, hen-headed chaplain's wife couldn't have heard and welcome. Would many fellows have had his chances and behaved as if they were frozen barbed-wire fences? And she'd looked at him--by Jove, she'd looked at him! Not that she'd meant anything by it; only it had been hard to have to sit on the only decent feelings he had ever had and not let them rip. And as far as Estelle was concerned, she didn't care a damn for him, and he might just as well have been a blackguard. But that wasn't quite the point, was it? Blackguards hurt girls, and he hadn't set out to hurt Claire.  Well, there was no use making any song or dance about it; he'd have to go. At first he had thought he could tell her he was married--tell her as soon as the competition was over, and stay on; but he hadn't counted on the way things grew, and he didn't think now he could tell her and then hold his tongue about what he felt. If he told her, the whole thing would be out; he couldn't keep it back. There were things you knew you could do, like going away and staying away; there were others you were a fool to try.  He circled slowly over the black ice surrounded by pink flames. It made him laugh, because he might have been a creature in hell. Yes, that was what hell was like, he had always known it--cold. Cold and lonely, when, if you'd only had a bit of luck, you might have been up somewhere in the sunlight, not alone. He didn't feel somehow this morning as if his marriage was an obstruction; he felt as if it were a shame. It hurt him terribly that what had driven him to Estelle could be called love, when love was this other feeling--the feeling that he'd like to be torn into little bits rather than fail Claire. He'd be ridiculous to please her; he'd face anything, suffer anything, take anything on. And it wasn't in the least that she was lovely. He didn't think about her beauty half as much as he thought about her health and the gentle, tender ways she had with sick people. He'd watched her over and over again, when she had no idea he was anywhere near, being nice to people in ways in which Winn had never dreamed before one could be nice. When people had nothing but their self-esteem left them, no attractions, no courage, no health, she'd just sit down beside them and make their self-esteem happy and comfortable.  She needn't have been anything but young and gay and triumphant, but she never shirked anybody else's pain. He had puzzled over her a good deal because, as far as he could see, she hadn't the ordinary rules belonging to good people--about church, and not playing cards for money, and pulling people up. It wasn't right and wrong she was thinking of most; it was other people's feelings.  He tried not to love her like that, because it made it worse. It was like loving God and Peter; it mixed him all up.  He couldn't see straight because everything he saw turned into love of her, and being with her seemed like being good; and it wasn't, of course, if he concealed things.  The icy blue rink turned slowly into gold before he had quite made up his mind what to do. Making up his mind had a good deal to do with Lionel, so that he felt fairly safe about it. It was going to hurt horribly, but if it only hurt him, it couldn't be said to matter. You couldn't have a safe plan that didn't hurt somebody, and as long as it didn't hurt the person it was made for, it could be counted a success.  Davos began to descend upon the rink, first the best skaters--Swedes, Russians, and Germans--and then all the world. The speed-skaters stood about in heavy fur coats down to their feet.  Claire came down surrounded by admirers. Winn heard her laugh before he saw her, and after he had seen her he saw nothing else. She looked like one of the fir-trees when the sun had caught it; she seemed aflame with a quite peculiar radiance and joy. She flew toward Winn, imitating the speed-skaters with one long swift stride of her skates.  ""Ah,"" she cried, ""isn't it a jolly morning? Isn't everything heavenly? Aren't you glad you are alive?""  That was the kind of mood she was in. It was quite superfluous to ask if she was nervous. She was just about as nervous as the sun was when it ran over the mountains.  ""There doesn't seem to be much the matter with you this morning,"" said Winn, eying her thoughtfully.  The rink cleared at eleven and the band began to play.  The judges sat in different quarters of the rink so as to get the best all-around impression of the skating. The audience, muffled up in furs, crowded half-way up the valley, as if it were a gigantic amphitheater.  A Polish girl, very tall and slender, with a long black pigtail, swung out upon the ice. She caught the music with a faultless steadiness and swing. Her eyes were fixed on the mountains; her flexible hips and waist swung her to and fro as easily as a winter bird hovers balanced on its steady pinions. Out of the crowd her partner, a huge black-bearded Russian, glided toward her, caught her by the waist, lifted her, and flung her from side to side in great swirls and resounding leaps. Her skirts flew about her, her pigtail swung round her in the air, her feet struck the ice firmly together like a pair of ringing castanets. The crowd shouted applause as he caught her by the wrists after a particularly dazzling plunge into the empty air, and brought her round to face them, her fixed eyes changed and shot with triumph. The dance was over.  Then a succession of men skaters came forward, whirling, twisting, capering with flying feet. Winn watched them with more astonishment than pleasure.  ""Like a ring of beastly slippery microbes!"" he remarked to Claire.  ""Yes,"" she said; ""but wait."" Half a dozen men and women came running out on the rink; with lifted feet, hand in hand, they danced like flying sunbeams.  Then a German pair followed the Polish. Both were strong, first-rate skaters, but the man was rough and selfish; he pulled his girl about, was careless of her, and in the end let her down, and half the audience hissed.  Swedish, Norwegian, French pairs followed swiftly after. Then Claire rose with a quickening of her breath.  ""Now,"" she said, ""you!"" It was curious how seldom she said Major Staines.  Winn didn't much care to do this kind of thing before foreigners. However, it was in a way rather jolly, especially when the music warmed one's blood. He swept her out easily to the center of the ice. For a time he had only to watch her. He wondered what she looked like to all the black-headed dots sitting in the sun and gazing. In his heart there was nothing left to which he could compare her. She turned her head a little, curving and swooping toward him, and then sprang straight into the air. He had her fast for a moment; her hands were in his, her eyes laughed at his easy strength, and again she shot away from him. Now he had to follow her, in and out, to the sound of the music; at first he thought of the steps, but he soon stopped thinking. Something had happened which made it quite unnecessary to think.  [Illustration: In his heart there was nothing left to which he could compare her]  He was reading everything she knew out of his own heart; she had got into him somehow, so that he had no need to watch for his cue.  Wherever she wanted him he was; whenever she needed the touch of his hand or his steadiness it was ready for her. They were like the music and words of a song, or like a leaf and the dancing air it rests upon. They were no longer two beings; they had slipped superbly, intolerably into one; they couldn't go wrong; they couldn't make a mistake. Where she led he followed, indissolubly a part of her.  They swung together for the final salute. It seemed to Winn that her heart--her happy, swift-beating, exultant heart--was in his breast, and then suddenly, violently he remembered that she wasn't his, that he had no right to touch her. He moved away from her, leaving her, a little bewildered, to bow alone to the great cheering mass of people.  She found him afterward far back in the crowd, with a white face and inscrutable eyes.  ""You must come and see the speed-skaters,"" she urged, with her hand on his arm. ""It's the thing I told you about most. And I believe we've won the second prize. The Russian and Pole have got the first, of course; They were absolutely perfect, but we were rather good. Why did you rush off, and what are you looking like that for? Is anything the matter? You're not--"" her voice faltered suddenly--""you're not angry, are you?""  ""No, I'm not angry,"" said Winn, recklessly, ""and nothing's the matter, and I'll go wherever you want and see what you want and do what you want, and I ran away because I was a damned fool and hate a fuss. And I see you're going to ask me if I liked it awfully. Yes, I did; I liked it awfully. Now are you satisfied?"" He still hadn't said anything, he thought, that mattered.  ""Oh, yes,"" she said slowly, ""of course I'm satisfied. I'm glad you liked it awfully; I liked it awfully myself.""     CHAPTER XVI   The valley of the Dischmatal lies between two rather shapeless mountains; it leads nowhere, and there is nothing in it.  Winn gave no reason for his wish to walk there with Lionel except that it was a quiet place for a talk. They had been together for twenty-four hours and so far they had had no talk. Lionel had expected to find a change in Winn; he had braced himself to meet the shock of seeing the strongest man he knew pitilessly weakened under an insidious disease. He had found a change, but not the one he expected. Winn looked younger, more alert, and considerably more vigorous. There was a curious excitement in his eyes which might have passed for happiness if he had not been so restless. He was glad to see Lionel, but that wasn't enough to account for it. Winn looked ten years younger and he had something up his sleeve.  Lionel had his own theory as to what that something might be, but he wouldn't have expected it to make Winn look younger. He couldn't help being afraid that Winn had found out Estelle. There had always been the chance that he might never find her out; he was neither reflective nor analytical, and Lionel was both. Winn might have been content simply to accept her as lovely and delightful, an ideal wife--not a companion, but a beautiful, fluttering creature to be supplied with everything it wanted. If he had done that he wouldn't have waked up to the fact that the creature gave him nothing whatever back--beyond preening its feathers and forbearing to peck. Lionel respected and loved women, so that he could afford to feel a certain contempt for Estelle, but he had always feared Winn's feeling any such emotion. Winn would condemn Estelle first and bundle her whole sex after her. Lionel hardly dared to ask him, as he did at last on their way through Dorf, what news he had of his wife.  ""What news of Estelle?"" Winn asked indifferently. ""None particularly. She doesn't like Peter's language. My people seem to have taken to him rather, and I hear he's picked up parts of the Governor's vocabulary. It'll be jolly hearing him talk; he couldn't when I left. Estelle's taken up religion. It's funny, my mother said she would, before we were married. My mother's got a pretty strong head; Estelle hasn't, she was keen about the Tango when I left; but I dare say religion's better for her; hers is the high church kind. Up there is the valley--funny sort of place; it'll remind you of the hills--that's one reason why I brought you out here--that and the hotel being like a fly paper. Davos is like all the places where our sort of people go--fashion or disease--it don't matter a penny which--they're all over the place itself, in and out of each other's pockets, and yet get a mile or two out and nobody's in sight. Funny how people like each other. I don't like 'em, you know. I hate 'em.""  In the early February afternoon the valley lay before them singularly still and white. There were no fir-trees on the sides of the abrupt snow slopes, and it took Winn some time to rediscover a faint pathway half blotted out by recent snow.  A few minutes later the road behind them vanished, everything dropped away from them but the snow, and the low gray skies. A tiny wind slipped along the valley; it was strange not to see it, for it felt like the push of a Presence, in the breathless solitude. A long way off Lionel could hear a faint noise like the sound of some one choking.  It reminded him of the sound behind the green baize doors in the hotel. It was just such a sound, suppressed, faint, but quite audible, that he heard along the passages at night. He looked questioningly at Winn.  ""That's a waterfall,"" said Winn; ""most of it's frozen up but it leaks through a little. There's a story about this place--I didn't mention it to you before, did I?""  Lionel shook his head. Winn was not in the habit of telling him stories about places. He had informed Lionel on one occasion some years ago, that he thought legends too fanciful, unless they were in the Bible, which was probably true, and none of our business. But Lionel had already wondered if this change in Winn wasn't on the whole making him more fanciful.  ""I dare say,"" Winn began, ""there's not a word of truth in it, and it's perfectly pointless besides; still it's a queer place, this valley, and what's particularly odd is, that though you can find it easily enough sometimes, there are days when I'm blessed if it's there at all! Anyhow I've gone wrong times out of number when I've looked for it, and you know I don't usually go wrong about finding places. This is the middle one of three valleys, count 'em backwards or forwards, whichever way you like--but I give you my word, after you've passed the first, and take the second turn, you'll find yourself in the third valley--or take it the other way, you'll be in the first. It's made me jumpy before now, looking for it. However, that hasn't anything to do with the story, such as it is.  ""They say that on New Year's eve, all the dead that have died in Davos (there must be a jolly lot of 'em when you come to think of it) process through the valley to the Waterfall. What their object is, of course, the story doesn't mention--ghosts, as far as I can see, never have much object, except to make you sit up; but they set out anyhow, scores and scores of 'em.  ""If it happens to be moonlight, you can see them slipping over the snow, making for the waterfall as fast as they can hoof it, but none of them look back--and if they were all your dearest friends you couldn't catch a glimpse of their faces--unless, I suppose, you had the gumption to start off by sitting up at the waterfall and waiting for 'em--which nobody has, of course. The point of the story, if you can call it a point, is that the last man in the procession isn't dead at all. He's a sort of false spook of the living--taking his first turn in with them--because as sure as fate he dies before the next year's out, and when the other chaps have reached the waterfall, he stops short and looks back toward Davos--that's how he's been spotted, and he's always died all right before the end of the year. Rum tale, isn't it?""  ""How did you get hold of it?"" Lionel asked curiously. ""It's not much in your line, is it?""  ""Well--I don't know,"" said Winn, taking out his pipe and preparing to light it. ""The last six months or so, I've thought a lot of funny things. I came up here prepared to die; that's to say, I thought I'd got to, which is as far as you can prepare for most things, but I'm not going to die, as I told you yesterday, but what I didn't mention to you then was that, on the whole, as it happens now, I'd jolly well rather.""  ""You mean,"" said Lionel, ""that it's got too thick between you and Estelle? I wish you'd tell me, old chap. I haven't an idea how it stands, but I've been afraid ever since I stayed with you, that you'd made a bit of a mistake over your marriage?""  ""As far as that goes,"" said Winn, ""I swallowed that down all right. It's no use bothering about a thing that isn't there. It's what is that counts. It counts damnably, I can tell you that. Look here, have you ever had any ideas about love?""  ""I can't say that I have,"" Lionel admitted cautiously. ""Many. I dare say I should like it if it came; and I've had fancies for girls, of course, but nothing so far I couldn't walk off, not what people call the real thing, I suppose. I've always liked women more than you have, and I don't think you get let in so much if you honestly like 'em. I haven't seen any one I particularly want to marry yet, if that's what you mean?""  ""That's part of it,"" agreed Winn. ""I supposed you'd been like that. I shouldn't wonder if what you say about liking 'em being safer, isn't true. I never liked 'em. I've taken what I could get when I wanted it. I rather wish I hadn't now, but I can't say I was ever sorry before. Even--Estelle--well, I don't want to be nasty about her--but it was only different, I can see that now, because I knew I couldn't get what I wanted without marrying her--still--I somehow think I'd made a kind of a start that time--only I got pulled up too short. I dare say I quite deserved it. That's no way of liking a woman. When you do _really_, you know all the rest's been half twaddle and half greed. Your father and mother are all right--so are mine really, though they do blow each other's heads off--still, there's something there--you know what I mean?""  ""Something indestructible and uniting--"" said Lionel quietly. ""I've often wondered about it.""  ""Well, I've never wondered about it,"" said Winn, firmly, ""and I'm not going to begin now. Still, I admit it's there. What I'm getting at is that there's something I want you to do for me. You'll probably think I'm mad, but I can't help that. It'll work out all right in the end, if you'll do it.""  ""You can ask me anything you like,"" said Lionel, quietly; ""any damned thing. I don't suppose I'll refuse to do it.""  The water broke into a prolonged gurgle under their feet; it sounded uncannily like some derisive listener. There was nothing in sight at all--not even their shadows on the unlighted snows.  ""Well--there's a girl here,"" Winn said in a low voice; ""it's not very easy to explain. I haven't told her about Estelle; I meant to, but I couldn't. I'm afraid you'll think I haven't played the game, but I haven't made love to her; only I can't stay any longer; I've got to clear out.""  Lionel nodded. ""All right,"" he said; ""let's go wherever you like; there are plenty of other snow places jollier than this.""  ""That isn't what I want,"" said Winn. ""I want you to stay with her. I want you to marry her eventually--d' you see? It's quite simple, really.""  ""By Jove,"" said Lionel, thoughtfully; ""simple, d' you call it? As simple as taking a header into the mid-Atlantic! And what good would it do you, my dear old chap, if I did? It wouldn't be you that had got her?""  ""I dare say not,"" said Winn; ""you don't see my point. She'd be all right with you. What I want for the girl is for her to be taken care of. She hasn't any people to speak of, and she's up here now with a rotten, unlicked cub of a brother. I fancy she's the kind of girl that would have a pretty hideous time with the wrong man. I've got to know she's being looked after. D' you see?""  ""But why should she marry?"" Lionel persisted. ""Isn't she all right as she is? What do you want to marry her off for?""  ""There'll be a man sooner or later,"" Winn explained. ""There always is, and she's--well, I didn't believe girls were innocent before. By God, when they are, it makes you sit up! I couldn't run the risk of leaving her alone, and that's flat! It's like chucking matches to a child and turning your back on it.  ""For after all, if a man cares about a girl the way I care about her, he does chuck her matches. When I go--some one decent ought to be there to take my place.""  ""But there isn't the slightest chance she'll like me, even if I happened to like her,"" Lionel protested. ""Honestly, Winn, you haven't thought the thing out properly. You can't stick people about in each other's places--they don't fit.""  ""They can be made to,"" said Winn, inexorably, ""if they're the proper people. She'll like you to start with, besides you read--authors. So does she--she's awfully clever, she doesn't think anything of Marie Corelli; and she likes a man. As to your taking to her--well, my dear chap, you haven't seen her! I give you a week; I'll hang about till then. You can tell me your decision at the end of it.""  ""That's another thing,"" said Lionel. ""Of course you only care for the girl, I see that, it's quite natural, but if by any chance I did pull the thing off--what's going to happen to you and me, afterwards? I've cared for that most, always.""  A Foehn wind had begun to blow up the valley--it brought with it a curious light that lay upon the snow like red dust. ""I don't say I shall like it,"" Winn said after a pause. ""I'm not out to like it. There isn't anything in the whole damned job possible for me to like. But I'd a lot rather have it than any other way. I think that ought to show you what I think of you. You needn't be afraid I'll chuck you for seeing me through. I might keep away for a time, but I'd come back. She isn't the kind of a woman that makes a difference between friends.""  ""Oh, all right,"" said Lionel after a pause, ""I'll go in for it--if I can.""  Winn got up and replaced his pipe carefully, shaking his ashes out on to the snow. ""I'm sure I'm much obliged to you,"" he said stiffly.  The wind ran up the valley with a sound like a flying train. Neither of them spoke while the gust lasted. It fell as suddenly as it came, and the valley shrank back into its pall of silence.  It was so solitary that it seemed to Lionel as if, at times, it might easily have no existence.  Lionel walked a little in front of Winn; the snow was soft and made heavy going. At the corner of the valley he turned to wait for Winn, and then he remembered the fanciful legend of New Year's eve, for he saw Winn's face very set and white, and his eyes looked as if the presence of death was in them--turned toward Davos.     CHAPTER XVII  Winn was under the impression that he could stand two or three days, especially if he had something practical to do. What helped him was the condition of Mr. Bouncing. Mr. Bouncing had suddenly retired. He had a bedroom on the other side of Winn's, and a sitting-room connected it with his wife's; but Mrs. Bouncing failed increasingly to take much advantage of this connection. Her theory was that, once you were in bed, you were better left alone.  Mr. Bouncing refused to have a nurse; he said they were disagreeable women who wouldn't let you take your own temperature. This might have seemed to involve the services of Mrs. Bouncing; but they were taken up for the moment by a bridge drive.  ""People do seem to want me so!"" she explained plaintively to Winn in the corridor. ""And I have a feeling, you know, Major Staines, that in a hotel like this it's one's duty to make things go.""  ""Some things go without much making,"" said Winn, significantly. He was under the impression that one of these things was Mr. Bouncing.  Winn made it his business, since it appeared to be nobody else's, to keep an eye on Mr. Bouncing: in the daytime he sat with him and ran his errands; at night he came in once or twice and heated things for Mr. Bouncing on a spirit lamp.  Mr. Bouncing gave him minute directions, and scolded him for leaving milk exposed to the menaces of the air and doing dangerous things with a teaspoon. Nevertheless, he valued Winn's company.  ""You see,"" he explained to Winn, ""when you can't sleep, you keep coming up to the point of dying. It's very odd, the point of dying, a kind of collapsishness that won't collapse. You say to yourself, 'I can't feel any colder than this,' or, 'I must have more breath,' or, 'This lung is bound to go if I cough much more.' And the funny part of it is, you do go on getting colder, and your breath breaks like a rotten thread, and you never stop coughing, and yet you don't go! I dare say I shall be quite surprised when I do. Then when you come in and give me warm, dry sheets and something hot to drink, something comes back. I suppose it's life force; but not much--never as much as when I started the collapse. I'm getting weaker every hour; don't you notice it? I never approved of all this lying in bed. I shall speak to Dr. Gurnet about it to-morrow.""  Winn had noticed it; he came and sat down by Mr. Bouncing's bed.  ""Snowy weather,"" he suggested, ""takes the life out of you.""  Mr. Bouncing ignored this theory.  ""I hear,"" he went on, ""that you and your new friend have changed your table. You don't sit with the Rivers any more.""  ""No,"" said Winn, laconically; ""table isn't big enough.""  ""I expect they eat too fast,"" Mr. Bouncing continued; ""young people almost always eat too fast. You'll digest better at another table. You look to me as if you had indigestion now.""  Winn shook his head.  ""Look here, Bouncing,"" he said earnestly, ""I'm going off to St. Moritz next week to have a look at the Cresta; I wish you'd have a nurse. Drummond will run in and give an eye to you, of course; but you're pretty seedy, and that's a fact. I don't like leaving you alone.""  ""Next week,"" said Mr. Bouncing, thoughtfully. ""Well, I dare say I shall be ready by then. It would be a pity, when I've just got you into the way of doing things properly, to have to teach them all over again to somebody else. I'm really not quite strong enough for that kind of thing. But I'm not going to have a nurse. Oh, dear, no! Nurses deceive you and cheer you up. I don't feel well enough to be cheered up. I like somebody who is thoroughly depressed himself, as you are, you know. I dare say you think I notice nothing lying here, but I've noticed that you're thoroughly depressed. Have you quarreled with your friend? It's odd you rush off to St. Moritz alone just when he's arrived.""  ""No, it isn't,"" said Winn, hastily. ""He'll join me later; he's staying here at my request.""  Mr. Bouncing sighed gently.  ""Well,"" he said; ""then all I can say is that you make very odd requests. One thing I'm perfectly sure about: if you go and look at the Cresta, you'll go down it, you're such a careless man, and then you'll be killed. Is that what you want?""  ""I could do with it,"" said Winn, briefly.  ""That,"" said Mr. Bouncing, ""is because you're strong. It really isn't nice to talk in that light way about being killed to any one who has got to be before very long whether he likes it or not. If you were in my place you'd value your life, unless it got too uncomfortable, of course.""  Winn apologized instantly. Mr. Bouncing accepted his apology graciously.  ""You'll learn,"" he explained kindly, ""how to talk to very ill people in time, and then probably you'll never see any more of them. Experience is a very silly thing, I've often noticed; it hops about so. No continuity. What I was going to say was, don't be worried about young Rivers and my wife. Take my word for it, you're making a great mistake.""  ""I am glad to hear you say so,"" Winn answered. ""As a matter of fact, I have at present a few little private worries of my own; but I'm relieved, you think the Rivers boy is all right. I've been thinking of having a little talk with that tutor of his.""  ""Ah, I shouldn't do that if I were you,"" said Mr. Bouncing, urgently; ""you're sure to be violent. I see you have a great deal of violence in you; you ought to control it. It's bad for your nerves. There are things I could tell you which would make you change your mind about young Rivers, but I don't know that I shall; it would excite me too much. I think I should like you to go down and telephone to Dr. Gurnet. Tell him my temperature is normal. It's a very odd thing; I haven't had a normal temperature for over three years. Perhaps I'm going to get better, after all. It's really only my breathing that's troubling me to-night. It would be funny if I got well, wouldn't it? But I mustn't talk any more; so don't come back until I knock in the night. Pass me the 'Pink 'Un.'"" Winn passed him the ""Pink 'Un"" and raised him with one deft, strong movement more comfortably up on his pillows.  ""You've got quite a knack for this sort of thing,"" Mr. Bouncing observed. ""If you'd been a clever man, you might have been a doctor.""  Mr. Bouncing did not knock during the night. Winn heard him stirring at ten o'clock, and went in. The final change had come very quickly. Mr. Bouncing was choking. He waved his hand as if the very appearance of Winn between him and the open balcony door kept away from him the air that he was vainly trying to breathe. Then a rush of blood came in a stream between his lips. Winn moved quickly behind him and lifted him in his arms.  Mr. Bouncing was no weight at all, and he made very little sound. He was quite conscious, and the look in his eyes was more interested than alarmed. The rush of bleeding stopped suddenly; his breathing was weaker and quieter, but he no longer choked.  ""Look here, old man,"" Winn said, ""let me get your wife.""  But Mr. Bouncing signaled to him not to move; after a time he whispered:  ""This is the first time I ever had hemorrhage. Most uncomfortable.""  ""Do let me get your wife!"" Winn urged again.  ""No,"" said Mr. Bouncing. ""Women--not much good--after the first.""  ""Don't talk any more then, old man,"" Winn pleaded. ""You'll start that bleeding off again.""  But Mr. Bouncing made a faint clicking sound that might have been a laugh.  ""Too late,"" he whispered. ""Don't matter now. No more risks. Besides, I'm too--too uncomfortable to live.""  There were several pauses in the hemorrhage, and at each pause Mr. Bouncing's mind came back to him as clear as glass. He spoke at intervals.  ""Not Rivers,"" he said, fixing Winn's eyes, ""Roper--Roper."" Then he leaned back on the strong shoulder supporting him. ""Glad to go,"" he murmured. ""Life has been--a damned nuisance. I've had--enough of it."" Then again, between broken, flying breaths he whispered, ""Lonely.""  ""That's all right,"" Winn said gently.  ""You're not alone now. I've got hold of you.""  ""No,"" whispered Mr. Bouncing, ""no, I don't think you have.""  There was no more violence now; his failing breath shook him hardly at all. Even as he spoke, something in him was suddenly freed; his chest rose slowly, his arm lifted then fell back, and Winn saw that he was no longer holding Mr. Bouncing.     CHAPTER XVIII   He closed the balcony door; the cold air filled the room as if it were still trying to come to the rescue of Mr. Bouncing. Winn had often done the last offices for the dead before, but always out of doors. Mr. Bouncing would have thought that a very careless way to die; he had often told Winn that he thought nature most unpleasant.  When Winn had set the room in order he sat down by the table and wondered if it would be wrong to smoke a cigarette. He wanted to smoke, but he came to the conclusion that it wasn't quite the thing.  To-night was the ball for the international skaters--he ought to have been there, of course. He had made Lionel go in his place, and had written a stiff little note to Claire, asking her to give his dances to his friend. He had Claire's answer in his pocket. ""Of course I will, but I'm awfully disappointed."" She had spelled disappointed with two s's and one p. Win had crushed the note into his pocket and not looked at it since, but he took it out now. It wasn't like smoking a cigarette. Bouncing wouldn't mind. There was no use making a fuss about it; he had done the best thing for her. He was handing all that immaculate, fresh youth into a keeping worthy of it. He wasn't fit himself. There were too many things he couldn't tell her, there was too much in him still that might upset and shock her. He would have done his best, of course, to have taken care of her; but better men could take better care. Lionel had said nothing so far; he had taken Claire skiing and skating, and once down the Schatz Alp. When he had come back from the Schatz Alp he had gone a long walk by himself. Winn had offered to accompany him, but Lionel had said he wanted to go alone and think. Winn accepted this decision without question. He knew Lionel was a clever man, but he didn't himself see anything to think about. The thing was perfectly simple: Lionel liked Claire or he didn't; no amount of being clever could make any difference. Winn was a little suspicious of thinking. It seemed to him rather like a way of getting out of things.  The room was very cold, but Winn didn't like going away and leaving Mr. Bouncing. By the by he heard voices in the next room. He could distinguish the high, flat giggle of Mrs. Bouncing. She had come back from the dance, probably with young Rivers. He must go in and tell her. That was the next thing to be done. He got up, shook himself, glanced at the appeased and peaceful young face upon the pillow, and walked into the next room. It was a sitting-room, and Winn had not knocked; but he shut the door instantly after him, and then stood in front of it, as if in some way to keep the silent tenant of the room behind him from seeing what he saw.  Mrs. Bouncing was in a young man's arms receiving a prolonged farewell. It wasn't young Rivers, and it was an accustomed kiss. Mrs. Bouncing screamed. She was the kind of woman who found a scream in an emergency as easily as a sailor finds a rope.  It wasn't Winn's place to say, ""What the devil are you doing here, sir?"" to Mr. Roper; it was the question which, if Mr. Roper had had the slightest presence of mind, he would have addressed to Winn. As it was he did nothing but snarl--a timid and ineffectual snarl which was without influence upon the situation.  ""You'd better clear out,"" Winn continued; ""but if I see you in Davos after the eight o'clock express to-morrow I shall give myself the pleasure of breaking every bone in your body. Any one's at liberty to play a game, Mr. Roper, but not a double game; and in the future I really wouldn't suggest your choosing a dying man's wife to play it with. It's the kind of thing that awfully ruffles his friends.""  ""I don't know what you mean,"" said Mr. Roper, hastily edging toward the door; ""your language is most uncalled for. And as to going away, I shall do nothing of the kind.""  ""Better think it over,"" said Winn, with misleading calm. He moved forward as he spoke, seized Mr. Roper by the back of his coat as if he were some kind of boneless mechanical toy, and deposited him in the passage outside the door.  Mrs. Bouncing screamed again. This time it was a shrill and gratified scream. She felt herself to be the heroine of an occasion. Winn eyed her as a hostile big dog eyes one beneath his fighting powers. Then he said:  ""I shouldn't make that noise if I were you; it's out of place. I came here to give you bad news.""  This time Mrs. Bouncing didn't scream. She took hold of the edge of the table and repeated three times in a strange, expressionless voice:  ""George is dead! George is dead! George is dead!""  Winn thought she was going to faint, but she didn't. She held on to the table.  ""What ought I to do, Major Staines?"" she asked in a quavering voice.  Winn considered the question gravely. It was a little late in the day for Mrs. Bouncing to start what she ought to do, but he approved of her determination.  ""I think,"" he said at last--""I think you ought to go in and look at him. It's usual.""  ""Oh, dear!"" said Mrs. Bouncing, with a shiver, ""I never have seen a corpse!""  Winn escorted her to the bedside and then turned away from her. She looked down at her dead husband. Mr. Bouncing had no anxiety in his face at all now; he looked incredibly contented and young.  ""I--I suppose he really is gone?"" said Mrs. Bouncing in a low voice. Then she moved waveringly over to a big armchair.  ""There is no doubt about it at all,"" said Winn. ""I didn't ring up Gurnet. He will come in any case first thing to-morrow morning.""  Mrs. Bouncing moved her beringed hands nervously, and then suddenly began to cry. She cried quietly into her pocket-handkerchief, with her shoulders shaking.  ""I wish things hadn't happened!"" she sobbed. ""Oh, dear! I wish things hadn't happened!"" She did not refer to the death of Mr. Bouncing. Winn said nothing. ""I really didn't mean any harm,"" Mrs. Bouncing went on between her sobs--""not at first. You know how things run on; and he'd been ill seven years, and one does like a little bit of fun, doesn't one?""  ""I shouldn't think about all that now,"" Winn replied. ""It isn't suitable.""  Mrs. Bouncing shook her head and sobbed louder; sobbing seemed a refuge from suitability.  ""I wouldn't have minded,"" she said brokenly, ""if I'd heated his milk. I always thought he was so silly about having skin on it. I didn't believe when he came up-stairs it was because he was really worse. I wanted the sitting-room to myself. Oh dear! oh dear! I said it was all nonsense! And he said, 'Never mind, Millie; it won't be for long,' and I thought he meant he'd get down-stairs again. And he didn't; he meant this!""  Winn cleared his throat.  ""I don't think he blamed you,"" he said, ""as much as I did.""  Mrs. Bouncing was roused by this into a sudden sense of her position.  ""Oh,"" she said, ""what are you going to do to me? You've always hated me. I'm sure I don't know why; I took quite a fancy to you that first evening. I always have liked military men, but you're so stand-offish; and now, of course, goodness knows what you'll think! If poor old George were alive he'd stand up for me!""  ""I'm not going to do anything to hurt you, Mrs. Bouncing,"" said Winn, after a short pause. ""You'll stay on here, of course, till after the funeral. We shall do all we can to help you, and then you'll go back to England, won't you?""  ""Yes,"" she said, shivering, ""I suppose so. I shall go back to England. I shall have to see George's people. They don't like me. Will--will that be all?""  ""As far as I am concerned,"" said Winn, more gently, ""there is only one thing further I have to suggest. I should like you to promise me, when you leave here, to have nothing more to do with young Rivers. It's better not; it puts him off his work.""  Mrs. Bouncing reddened.  ""Oh,"" she said, ""I know; I didn't mean any harm by that. You can't help young men taking a fancy to you, can you? At least I can't. It looked better didn't it, in a way--you know what I mean. I didn't want people to think anything. If only George hadn't been so good to me! I don't suppose you can understand, but it makes it worse when they are.""  It seemed to Winn as if he could understand, but he didn't say so. Bouncing should have pulled her up. Winn always believed in people being pulled up. The difficulty lay in knowing how to carry the process out. It had seemed to Mr. Bouncing simpler to die.  ""You'd better go to bed now,"" Winn said at last. ""People will be up soon. He died quite peacefully. He didn't want you to be disturbed. I think that's all, Mrs. Bouncing.""  She got up and went again to the bed.  ""I suppose I oughtn't to kiss him?"" she whispered. ""I haven't any right to now, have I? You know what I mean? But I would have liked to kiss him.""  ""Oh, I don't believe he'd mind,"" said Winn, turning away.  Mrs. Bouncing kissed him.     CHAPTER XIX   Winn felt no desire to go to bed. He went out into the long, blank corridor and wondered if the servants would be up soon and he could get anything to drink. The passage was intensely still; it stretched interminably away from him like a long, unlighted road. A vague gray light came from the windows at each end. It was too early for the shapes of the mountains to be seen. The outside world was featureless and very cold.  There was no sound in the house except the faint sound behind the green baize doors, which never wholly ceased. Winn had always listened to it before with an impatient distaste; he had hated to hear these echoes of dissolution. This morning, for the first time, he felt curious.  Suppose things had gone differently; that he'd been too late, and known his fate? He could have stayed on then; he could have accepted Claire's beautiful young friendliness. He could have left her free; and yet he could have seen her every day; then he would have died.  Weakness has privileges. It escapes responsibility; allowances are made for it. It hasn't got to get up and go, tearing itself to pieces from the roots. He could have told her about Peter and Estelle and what a fool he had been; and at the end, he supposed, it wouldn't have mattered if he had just mentioned that he loved her.  Now there wasn't going to be any end. Life would stretch out narrow, interminable, and dark, like the passage with the windows at each end, which were only a kind of blur without any light.  However, of course there was no use bothering about it; since the servants weren't up and he couldn't get any coffee, he must just turn in. It suddenly occurred to Winn that what he was feeling now was unhappiness, a funny thing; he had never really felt before. It was the kind of feeling the man had had, under the lamp-post at the station, carrying his dying wife. The idea of a broken heart had always seemed to Winn namby-pamby. You broke if you were weak; you didn't break if you were strong. What was happening now was that he was strong and he was being broken. It was a painful process, because there was a good deal of him to break, and it had only just begun. However, this was mercifully hidden from him. He said to himself: ""I dare say I'm run down and fidgety with having had to sit up with Bouncing. I shall feel all right to-morrow."" Then the door behind him opened, and Lionel joined him. He was still dressed as he had been when he came back from the ball some hours earlier.  ""Hullo!"" he said. ""I wondered if that was you; I thought I heard something stirring outside. You weren't in your room when I came in. Been with Bouncing?""  ""Yes,"" said Winn; ""he's dead. I'm looking for some coffee. These confounded, tow-headed Swiss mules never get up at any decent hour. Why are you still dressed? Nothing wrong, is there?""  ""Well, I didn't feel particularly sleepy, somehow,"" Lionel acknowledged. ""Are you going to stand outside in this moth-eaten passage the rest of the night, or will you come in with me and have a whisky and soda? You must be fagged out.""  ""I don't mind if I do,"" Winn agreed. ""We may as well make a night of it.""  For a few minutes neither of them spoke, then Winn said: ""Had a jolly dance?""  Lionel did not answer him directly; but he turned round, and met his friend's eyes with his usual unswerving honesty.  ""Look here, old Winn,"" he said, ""it's up to you to decide now. I'll stay on here or go with you, whichever you like.""  ""You like her, then?"" Winn asked quickly.  ""Yes,"" said Lionel, ""I like her.""  ""Well, then, you'll stay of course,"" said Winn without any hesitation. ""Isn't that what we damned well settled?""  Lionel's eyes had changed. They were full of a new light; he looked as if some one had lit a lantern within him. Love had come to him not as it had come to Winn, bitterly, unavailingly, without illusion; it had fallen upon his free heart and lit it from end to end with joy. He loved as a man loves whose heart is clean and who has never loved before, without a scruple and without restraint. Love had made no claims on him yet; it had not offered him either its disappointments or its great rewards. He was transformed without being altered. He simply saw everything as glorious which before had been plain, but he did not see different things.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""I know we talked about it; but I'm hanged if I'll try unless I'm sure you are absolutely keen. I thought it all out after--after I'd seen her, and it seemed to me all very well in the abstract giving her up to another man and all that, but when it came to the point, would you be really sure to want me to carry through? I've seen her now, you know, and I'm glad I've seen her. I'll be glad always for that, but it needn't go any further.""  Winn looked past him; he was tired with the long night's strain, and he had no white ideal to be a rapture in his heart. He loved Claire not because she was perfection, but because she was herself. She was faultless to Lionel, but Winn didn't care whether she was faultless or not. He didn't expect perfection or even want it, and he wasn't the man to be satisfied with an ideal; but he wanted, as few men have ever wanted for any women, that Claire should be happy and safe.  ""I've told you once,"" he said; ""you might know I shouldn't change. I've got one or two little jobs to see to about Bouncing's funeral. That woman's half a little cat and half an abject fool. Still, you can't help feeling a bit sorry for her. I dare say I can get things done by lunch-time; then I'll drive over the Fluella. I'll put up at the Kulm; but don't bother to write till you've got something settled. I'm not going to mess about saying good-by to people. You can tell Miss Rivers when I'm gone.""  ""Look here,"" Lionel urged, ""you can't do that; you must say good-by to her properly. She was awfully sick at your not turning up at the ball. After all, you know, you've seen a lot of her, and she particularly likes you. You can't jump off into space, as if you were that old chap in the Bible without any beginning or any end!""  Winn stuck his hands in his pockets and looked immovably obstinate.  ""I'm damned if I do,"" he replied. ""Why should I? What's the use of saying good-by? The proper thing to do when you're going away is to go. You needn't linger, mewing about like somebody's pet kitten.""  Lionel poured out the whiskey before replying, and pushed a glass in Winn's direction; then he said:  ""Don't be a fool, old chap; you'll have to say good-by to her. You don't want to hurt her feelings.""  ""What's it to you whether I hurt her feelings or not?"" Winn asked savagely.  There was a moment's sharp tension. It dropped at the tone of Lionel's quiet voice.  ""It's a great deal to me,"" he said steadily; ""but I know it's not half as much to me as it is to you, old Winn.""  ""Oh, all right,"" said Winn after a short pause. ""I suppose I'll say it if you think I ought to. Only stand by if you happen to be anywhere about. By the by, I hope I shall have some kind of a scrap with Roper before the morning's over. I shall enjoy that. Infernal little beast, I caught him out last night. I can't tell you how; but unless he's off by the eight o'clock to-morrow, he's in for punishment.""  Lionel laughed.  ""All right,"" he said; ""don't murder him. I'm going to turn in now. Sorry about Bouncing. Did he have a bad time, poor chap?""  ""No,"" said Winn, ""not really. He had a jolly sight harder time living; and yet I believe he'd have swopped with me at the end. Funny how little we know what the other fellow feels!""  ""We can get an idea sometimes,"" Lionel said in a queer voice, with his back to his friend. Winn hastened to the door of his room. He knew that Lionel had an idea. He said, as he half closed the door on himself:  ""Thanks awfully for the whiskey.""     CHAPTER XX   Unfortunately, Winn was not permitted the pleasure of punishing Mr. Roper in the morning. Mr. Roper thought the matter over for the greater part of an unpleasantly short night. He knew that he could prepare a perfect case, he could easily clear himself to his pupil, he could stand by his guns, and probably even succeed in making Mrs. Bouncing stand by hers; but he didn't want to be thrashed. Whatever else happened, he knew that he could not get out of this. Winn meant to thrash him, and Winn would thrash him. People like Winn could not be manipulated; they could only be avoided. They weren't afraid of being arrested, and they didn't care anything about being fined. They damned the consequences of their ferocious acts; and if you happened to be one of the consequences and had a constitutional shrinking from being damned, it was wiser to pack early and be off by an eight o'clock train.  Winn was extremely disappointed at this decision; it robbed him of something which, as he thought, would have cleared the air. However, he spent a busy morning in assisting Mrs. Bouncing. She was querulous and tearful and wanted better dressmakers and a more becoming kind of mourning than it was easy to procure in Davos. It seemed to Winn as if she was under the impression that mourning was more important to a funeral than a coffin; but when it came to the coffin, she had terrible ideas about lilies embroidered in silver, which upset Winn very much.  Mr. Bouncing had always objected to lilies. He considered that their heavy scent was rather dangerous. Mrs. Bouncing told Winn what everybody in the hotel had suggested, and appeared to expect him to combine and carry out all their suggestions, with several other contradictory ones of her own.  During this crisis Maurice Rivers markedly avoided Mrs. Bouncing. He felt as if she might have prevented Mr. Bouncing's death just then. It was a failure of tact. He didn't like the idea of death, and he had always rather counted oh the presence of Mr. Bouncing. He was afraid he might, with Mr. Bouncing removed, have gone a little too far.  He explained his position to Winn, whom he met on one of his many errands.  ""One doesn't want to let oneself in for anything, you know,"" he asserted. ""I'm sure, as a man of the world, you'd advise me to keep out of it, wouldn't you? It's different for you, of course; you were poor Bouncing's friend.""  Winn, whose temper was extremely ruffled, gave him a formidable glance.  ""You get into things a bit too soon, my boy,"" he replied coldly, ""and get out of 'em a bit too late.""  ""Oh, come, you know,"" said Maurice, jauntily, ""I'm not responsible for poor old Bouncing's death, am I?""  ""I don't say you are,"" Winn continued, without looking any pleasanter. ""Bouncing had to die, and a jolly good thing for him it was when it came off; his life wasn't worth a row of pins. But I wasn't talking about him; I was talking about her. If you really want my advice, I'll tell you plainly that if you want to go the pace, choose women one doesn't marry, don't monkey about with the more or less respectable ones who have a right to expect you to play the game. It's not done, and it's beastly unfair. D' you see my point?""  Maurice wondered if he should be thoroughly angry or not. Suddenly it occurred to him that Winn was waiting, and that he had better see his point and not be thoroughly angry.  ""Yes, I dare say I did go a little far,"" he admitted, throwing out a manly chest; ""but between you and me, Staines, should you say our friend Mrs. B. _was_ respectable or not?""  ""She isn't my friend,"" said Winn, grimly; ""but as she ought to be yours, I'll trouble you to keep your questions to yourself.""  The idea of being angry having apparently been taken out of Maurice's hands, he made haste to disappear into the hotel.  Winn walked on into the village. It was the last time he intended to go there. There was nothing peculiarly touching about the flat, long road, with the rink beneath it and the mountains above. The houses and shops, German pensions and crowded balconies had no particular charm. Even the tall, thin spire of the church lacked distinction; and yet it seemed to Winn that it would be difficult to forget. He stopped at the rink as he returned to pick up his skates. He told himself that he was fortunate when he discovered Claire, with Lionel on one side of her and Ponsonby on the other; he had wanted the help of an audience; now he was going to have one. Claire saw him before the others did, and skated swiftly across to him.  ""But why don't you put your skates on?"" she said, pointing to them in his hand. ""You're not much good there, you know, on the bank.""  ""I'm not much good anywhere, as far as that goes,"" said Winn, quickly, before the others came up. Then he said in a different voice, ""I hope you enjoyed your dance last night.""  Claire paused the briefest moment before she answered him; it was as if she were trying quickly to change the key in which she spoke in order to meet his wishes, and as if she did not want to change the key.  ""Yes, I did,"" she said, ""most awfully. It was a heavenly dance. I was so sorry you couldn't come, but Captain Drummond told me why.""  Winn confounded Lionel under his breath for not holding his tongue; but he felt a warmth stir in his heart at the knowledge that, no matter what was at stake, Lionel would not suffer the shadow of blame to attach itself to him. It had been one of Winn's calculations that Claire would be annoyed at his disappointing her and think the less of him because she was annoyed. He was not a clever calculator.  ""Of course I understood,"" Claire went on; ""you had to be with poor Mr. Bouncing. It was just like you to stay with him."" She had said a good deal, considering that Mr. Ponsonby and Lionel were there. Still, Winn did not misunderstand her. Of course she meant nothing.  ""Well,"" he said, holding out his hand, ""I'm extremely glad, Miss Rivers, to have run across you like this, because I'm off this afternoon to St. Moritz. I want to have a look at the Cresta.""  Claire ignored his outstretched hand.  ""Oh,"" she cried a little breathlessly, ""you're not going away, are you? But you'll come back again, of course?""  ""I hope so, I'm sure, some day or other,"" said Winn. Then he turned to Ponsonby. ""Have you been down the Cresta?"" he asked.  Mr. Ponsonby shook his head.  ""Not from Church Leap,"" he replied. ""I've got too much respect for my bones. It's awfully tricky; I've gone down from below it. You don't get such a speed on then.""  ""Oh, Major Staines, you won't toboggan?"" Claire cried out. ""You know you mustn't toboggan! Dr. Gurnet said you mustn't. You won't, will you? Captain Drummond, aren't you going with him to stop him?""  Lionel laughed.  ""He isn't a very easy person to stop,"" he answered her. ""I'll join him later on, of course; but I want to see a little more of Davos before I go.""  ""There isn't the slightest danger,"" Winn remarked, without meeting Claire's eyes. ""The Cresta's as safe as a church hassock. There isn't half the skill in tobogganing that there is in skating. Good-by, Miss Rivers. I never enjoyed anything as much as I enjoyed our skating competition. I'm most grateful to you for putting up with me.""  Claire gave him her hand then, but Winn remembered afterward that she never said good-by. She looked at him as if he had done something which was not fair.     CHAPTER XXI   Winn's chief objection to St. Moritz was the shabby way in which it imitated Davos. It had all the same materials--endless snows, forests of fir-trees, soaring peaks and the serene blueness of the skies--and yet as Davos it didn't in the least come off. It was more beautiful and less definite; the peaks were nearer and higher; they streamed out around the valley like an army with banners. The long, low lake and the small, perched villages, grossly overtopped by vulgar hotel palaces, had a far more fugitive air.  It was a place without a life of its own. Whatever character St. Moritz might once have had was as lost as that of the most catholic of evening ladies in Piccadilly.  Davos had had the dignity of its purpose; it had set out to heal. St. Moritz, on the contrary, set out to avoid healing. It was haunted by crown princes and millionaire Jews, ladies with incredible ear-rings and priceless furs; sharp, little, baffling trans-atlantic children thronged its narrow streets, and passed away from it as casually as a company of tramps.  There was this advantage for Winn: nobody wanted to be friendly unless one was a royalty or a financial magnate. Winn was as much alone as if he had dropped from Charing Cross into the Strand. He smoked, read his paper, and investigated in an unaccommodating spirit all that St. Moritz provided; but he didn't have to talk.  Winn was suffering from a not uncommon predicament: he had done the right thing at enormous cost, and he was paying for it, instead of being paid. Virtue had struck her usual hard bargain with her votaries. She had taken all he had to give, and then sent in a bill for damages.  He was not in the least aware that he was unhappy, and often, for five or ten minutes at a time, he would forget Claire; afterward he would remember her, and that was worse. The unfortunate part of being made all of a piece is that if you happen to want anything, there is really no fiber of your being that doesn't want it.  Winn loved in the same spirit that he rode and he always rode to a finish. In these circumstances and in this frame of mind, the Cresta occurred to Winn in the light of a direct inspiration. No one could ride the Cresta with any other preoccupation.  Winn knew that he oughtn't to do it; he remembered Dr. Gurnet's advice, and it put an edge to his intention. If he couldn't have what he wanted, there would be a minor satisfaction in doing what he oughtn't. The homely adage of cutting off your nose to spite your face had never been questioned by the Staines family. They looked upon a nose as there chiefly for that purpose. It was a last resource to be drawn upon, when the noses of others appeared to be out of reach.  There were, however, a few preliminary difficulties. No one was allowed to ride the Cresta without practice, and it was a part of Winn's plan not to be bothered with gradual stages. Only one man had ever been known to start riding the Cresta from Church Leap without previous trials, and his evidence was unobtainable as he was unfortunately killed during the experiment. Since this adventure a stout Swiss peasant had been placed to guard the approaches to the run. Winn walked up to him during the dinner-hour, when he knew the valley was freest from possible intruders.  ""I want you to clear off,"" he said to the man, offering him five francs, and pointing in the direction of St. Moritz. The peasant shook his head, retaining the five francs, and opening the palm of his other hand. Winn placed a further contribution in it and said firmly:  ""Now if you don't go I shall knock you down."" He shook his fist to reinforce the feebleness of his alien speech. The Swiss peasant stepped off the path hurriedly into a snow-drift. He was a reasonable man, and he did not grasp why one mad Englishman should wish to be killed, nor, for the matter of that, why others equally mad, should wish to prevent it. So he walked off in the direction of St. Moritz and hid behind a tree, reposing upon the deeply rooted instinct of not being responsible for what he did not see.  Winn regarded the run methodically, placed his toboggan on the summit of the leap, and looked down at the thin, blue streak stretching into the distance. The valley appeared to be entirely empty; there was nothing visibly moving in it except a little distant smoke on the way to Samaden. The run looked very cold and very narrow; the nearest banks stood up like cliffs.  Winn strapped a rake to his left foot, and calculated that the instant he felt the ice under him he must dig into it, otherwise he would go straight over the first bank. Then he crouched over his toboggan, threw himself face downward, and felt it spring into the air.  He kept no very definite recollection of the sixty-odd seconds that followed. The ice rose up at him like a wall; the wind--he had not previously been aware of the faintest draught of air--cut into his eyes and forehead like fire. His lips blistered under it.  He felt death at every dizzy, dwindling second--death knotted up and racketing, so imminent that he wouldn't have time to straighten himself out or let go of his toboggan before he would be tossed out into the empty air.  He remembered hearing a man say that if you fell on the Cresta and didn't let go of your toboggan, it knocked you to pieces. His hands were fastened on the runners as if they were clamped down with iron. The scratching of the rake behind him sounded appalling in the surrounding silence.  He shot up the first bank, shaving the top by the thinness of a hair, wobbled sickeningly back on to the straight, regained his grip, shot the next bank more easily, and whirled madly down between the iron walls. He felt as if he were crawling slowly as a fly crawls up a pane of glass, in a buzzing eternity.  Then he was bumped across the road and shot under the bridge. There was a hill at the end of the run. As he flew up it he became for the first time aware of pace. The toboggan took it like a racing-cutter, and at the top rose six feet into the air, and plunged into the nearest snow-drift.  Winn crawled out, feeling very sick and shaken, and as if every bone in his body was misplaced.  ""Oh, you idiot! You idiot! you unbounded, God-forsaken idiot!"" a voice exclaimed in his ears. ""You've given me the worst two minutes of my life!""  Winn looked around him more annoyed than startled. He felt a great disinclination for speech and an increasing desire to sit down and keep still; and he did not care to conduct a quarrel sitting down.  However, a growing inability to stand up decided him; he dragged out his toboggan and sat on it.  The speaker appeared round a bend of the run. She had apparently been standing in the path that overlooked a considerable portion of it.  She was not a young woman, and from her complexion and the hardness of her thickly built figure she might have been made of wood.  She wore a short, strapped-in skirt, leather leggings, and a fawn-colored sweater. Her eyes were a sharp, decided blue, and the rest of her appearance matched the sweater.  Winn pulled himself together.  ""I don't see, Madam,"" he remarked slowly, but with extreme aggressiveness, ""what the devil my actions have to do with you!""  ""No,"" said the lady, grimly, ""I don't suppose from the exhibition I've just been watching, that you're in the habit of seeing farther than to the end of your own nose. However, I may as well point out to you that if you had killed yourself, as you richly deserved, and as you came within an ace of doing, the run would have been stopped for the season. We should all have been deprived of the Grand National, and I, who come up here solely to ride the Cresta, which I have done regularly every winter for twenty years, would have had my favorite occupation snatched from me at an age when I could least afford to miss it.""  ""I haven't been killed, and I had not the slightest intention of being so,"" Winn informed her with dangerous calm. ""I merely wished to ride the Cresta for the first time unobserved. Apparently I have failed in my intention. If so, it is my misfortune and not my fault."" He took out a cigarette, and lit it with a steady hand, and turned his eyes away from her. He expected her to go away, but, to his surprise, she spoke again.  ""My name,"" she said, ""is Marley. What is yours?""  ""Staines,"" Winn replied with even greater brevity. He had to give her his name, but he meant it to be his last concession.  ""Ah,"" she said thoughtfully, ""that accounts for it. You're the image of Sir Peter, and you seem to have inherited not only his features, but his manners. I needn't, perhaps, inform you that the latter were uniformly bad. I knew your father when I was a girl. He was stationed in Hong-Kong at the time and he was good enough to call me the little Chinese, no doubt in reference to my complexion. Plain as I am now, I was a great deal plainer as a girl, though I dare say you wouldn't think it.""  Winn made no comment upon this doubtful statement; he merely grunted. His private opinion was that ladies of any age should not ride the Cresta, and that ladies old enough to have known his father at Hong-Kong should not toboggan at all.  It was unsuitable, and she might have hurt herself; into these two pitfalls women should never fall.  Miss Marley had a singularly beautiful speaking voice; it was as soft as velvet. She dropped it half a tone, and said suddenly:  ""Look here, don't do that kind of thing again. It's foolish. People don't always get killed, you know; sometimes they get maimed. Forgive me, but I thought I would just like to point it out to you. I could not bear to see a strong man maimed.""  Winn knew that it was silly and weak to like her just because of the tone of her voice, but he found himself liking her. He had a vague desire to tell her that he wouldn't do it again and that he had been rather a fool; but the snow was behaving in a queer way all around him; it appeared to be heaving itself up. He said instead:  ""Excuse me for sitting down like this. I've had a bit of a shake. I'll be all right in a moment or two."" Then he fainted.  Miss Marley stooped over him, opened his collar, laid him flat on the ground--he had fallen in a heap on his toboggan--and chafed his wrists and forehead with snow. When she saw that he was coming round, she moved a little away from him and studied his toboggan.  ""If I were you,"" she observed, ""I should have these runners cut a little finer; they are just a shade too thick.""  Winn dragged himself on to the toboggan and wondered how his collar came to be undone. When he did it up, he found his hands were shaking, which amazed him very much. He looked a little suspiciously at his companion.  ""Of course,"" Miss Marley continued pleasantly, ""I ought to have that watchman discharged. I am a member of the Cresta committee, and he behaved scandalously; but I dare say you forced him into it, so I shall just walk up the hill and give him a few straight words. Probably you don't know the dialect. I've made a point of studying it. If I were you, I should stay where you are until I come back. I want you to come to tea with me at Cresta. There's a particularly good kind of bun in the village, and I think I can give you some rather useful tobogganing tips. It isn't worth while your climbing up the hill just to climb down again, is it? Besides, you'd probably frighten the man.""  ""Thanks,"" said Winn. ""All right; I'll stay."" He didn't want the Cresta bun, and he thought that he resented Miss Marley's invitation; but, on the other hand, he was intensely glad she was going off and leaving him alone.  He felt uncommonly queer. Perhaps he could think of some excuse to avoid the tea when she came back.  All the muscles of his chest seemed to have gone wrong; it hurt him to breathe. He sat with his head down, like a man climbing a hill against a strong wind. It was rather funny to feel ill again when he had really forgotten he was up there for his health. That was what he felt--ill.  It was not nearly as painful a feeling as remembering Claire. Unfortunately, it was very quickly followed by the more painful feeling.  When Miss Marley came back, he had the eyes of a creature caught in a trap.  She took him to Cresta to tea, and it did not occur to Winn to wonder why a woman who at forty-five habitually rode the Cresta should find it necessary to walk at the pace of a deliberating snail. It was a pace which at the moment suited Winn precisely.  On the whole he enjoyed his tea. Miss Marley's manners, though abrupt, had certain fine scruples of their own. She showed no personal curiosity and she gave Winn some really valuable tips. He began to understand why she had so deeply resented his trifling with the Cresta.  Miss Marley was one of the few genuine workers at St. Moritz, a member of the old band who had worked devotedly to produce the Monster which had afterward as promptly devoured them. This fate, however, had not as yet overtaken Miss Marley. She was too tough and too rich to be very easily devoured. The Cresta was at once her child and her banner; she had helped to make it, and she wound its folds around her as a screen for her invisible kindnesses.  Menaced boys could have told how she had averted their ruin with large checks and sharp reproofs. She had saved many homes and covered many scandals. For girls she had a special tenderness. She had never been a beautiful young girl, and she had a pathetic reverence for what was frail and fair. For them she had no reproofs, only vast mercy, and patient skill in releasing them from the traps which had caught their flurried young senses; but for those who had set the traps she had no mercy.  Miss Marley was not known for any of these things. She was celebrated for fights with chaplains and sanitary inspectors, and for an inability to give in to authority unless authority knew what it was about. She had never once tried to please, which is the foundation of charm. Perhaps it would have been a useless effort, for she was not born to please. She was born to get things done.  After Miss Marley had talked to Winn for an hour, she decided to get him to join the Bandy Club. He was the kind of man who must do something, and it was obviously better that he should not again tempt fate by riding the Cresta from Church Leap without practice. This course became clearer to Miss Marley when she discovered that Winn had come up for his health.  ""Of course a fellow who wasn't seedy wouldn't have made an ass of himself over riding the Cresta,"" Winn explained, eyeing her thoughtfully.  He must have got somehow off his toboggan on to the snow, and he had no recollection at all of getting there. Miss Marley said nothing to enlighten him further. She merely suggested bandy. After dinner she introduced Winn to the captain of the St. Moritz team, and at three o'clock the next afternoon she watched him play in a practice-match.  Winn played with a concentrated viciousness which assured her of two things: he would be an acquisition to the team, and if he felt as badly as all that, it was just as well to get some of it worked off on anything as unresponsive as a ball.  After this Miss Marley let him alone. She considered this the chief factor in assisting the lives of others; and for nearly two hours a day, while he was playing bandy, Winn succeeded in not remembering Claire.     CHAPTER XXII   Winn's way of playing bandy was to play as if there wasn't any ice. In the first few practices it had the disadvantage of a constant series of falls, generally upon the back of his head; but he soon developed an increasing capacity of balance and an intensity of speed. He became the quickest forward the St. Moritz team had ever possessed.  When he was following the ball he took up his feet and ran. The hard clash of the skates, the determined onrush of the broad-built, implacable figure, were terrible to withstand. What was to be done against a man who didn't skate, but tore, who fell upon a ball as a terrier plunges, eyeless and intent, into a rat-hole? The personal safety of himself or others never occurred to Winn. He remembered nothing but the rules of the game. These he held in the back of his mind, with the ball in front of it.  All St. Moritz came to watch the great match between itself and Davos. It was a still, cold day; there was no blue in the sky; the mountains were a hard black and white and the valley very colorless and clear. There was a hush of coming snow in the air, and the sky was covered by a toneless, impending cloud.  The game, after a brief interval, became a duel between two men: Winn, with his headlong, thirsty method of attack, and the champion player of Davos, Mavorovitch, who was known as the most finished skater of the season.  Mavorovitch never apparently lifted his skates, but seemed to send them forward by a kind of secret pressure. He was a very cool player, as quick as mercury and as light as thistledown. Winn set himself against him with the dogged fury of a bull against a toreador.  ""That man's not brave; he's careless,"" a St. Moritz potentate remarked to Miss Marley. Miss Marley gave a short laugh and glanced at Winn.  ""That's my idea of courage,"" she said, ""carelessness toward things that don't count. Major Staines isn't careless with the ball.""  ""A game's a game,"" the foreign prince protested, ""not a prolonged invitation to concussion.""  ""All, that's where your foreign blood comes in, Your Highness,"" argued Miss Marley. ""A game isn't a game to an Englishman; it's his way of tackling life. As a man plays so he reaps.""  ""Very well, then,"" remarked her companion, gravely. ""Mark my words, Madame, your friend over there will reap disaster.""  Winn tackled the ball in a series of sudden formidable rushes; he hurled himself upon the slight form of Mavorovitch, only to find he had before him a portion of the empty air. Mavorovitch was invariably a few inches beyond his reach, and generally in possession of the ball.  Twice Winn wrested it forcibly from him and got half way up the ice, tearing along with his skates crashing their iron way toward the goal, and twice Mavorovitch noiselessly, except for a faint scraping, slid up behind him and coaxed the ball out of his very grip. St. Moritz lost two goals to nothing in the first half, and Winn felt as if he were biting on air.  He stood a little apart from the other players, with his back turned to the crowd. He wished it wasn't necessary always to have an audience; a lot of people who sat and did nothing irritated him. Mavorovitch irritated him, too. He did not like a man to be so quiet; the faint _click_, _click_ of Mavorovitch's skates on the ice was like a lady knitting.  The whistle sounded again, and Winn set upon the ball with redoubled fury. He had a feeling that if he didn't win this game he was going to dislike it very much. He tore up the ice, every muscle strained, his stick held low, caressing the round, flying knob in front; he had got the ball all right, the difficulty was going to be, to keep it. His mind listened to the faint distant scraping of Mavorovitch's approach. Winn had chosen the exact spot for slowing up for his stroke.  It must be a long-distance shot or Mavorovitch would be there to intercept him, the longer, the safer, if he could get up speed enough for his swing. He had left the rest of the players behind him long ago, tossing some to one side and outflanking others; but he had not got clear away from Mavorovitch, bent double, and quietly calculating, a few feet behind him, the exact moment for an intercepting spurt: and then through the sharpness of the icy air and the sense of his own speed an extraordinary certainty flashed into Winn. He was not alone; Claire was there. He called it a fancy, but he knew it was a certainty. A burning joy seized him, and a new wild strength poured into him. He could do anything now.  He drew up suddenly, long before the spot he had fixed upon as a certain stroke, lifted his arm, and struck with all his might. It was a long, doubtful, crossing stroke, almost incredibly distant from the goal.  The crowd held its breath as the ball rose, cutting straight above the goal-keeper's head, through the very center of the goal.  Winn was probably the only person there who didn't follow its flight. He looked up quickly at the bank above him, and met her eyes. She was as joined to him as if they had no separate life.  In a moment it struck him that there was nothing else to do but to go to her at once, take her in his arms, and walk off with her somewhere into the snow. He knew now that he had been in hell; the sight of her was like the sudden cessation of blinding physical pain.  Then he pulled himself together and went back to the game. He couldn't think any more, but the new activity in him went on playing methodically and without direction.  Mavorovitch, who was playing even more skilfully and swiftly, got the better of him once or twice; but the speed that had given Winn room for his great stroke flowed tirelessly through him. It seemed to him as if he could have outpaced a Scotch express.  He carried the ball off again and again out of the mob of his assailants. They scattered under his rushes like creatures made of cardboard. He offered three goals and shot one. The cheering of the St. Moritzers sounded in his ears as if it were a long way off. He saw the disappointed, friendly grin of little Mavorovitch as the last whistle settled the match at five goals to four against Davos, but everything seemed cloudy and unreal. He heard Mavorovitch say:  ""Spooner never told us he had a dark horse over here. I must say I am disappointed. Until half-time I thought I should get the better of you; but how did you get that devilish spurt on? Fierce pace tires, but you were easier to tire when you began.""  Winn's eyes wandered over the little man beside him.  ""Oh, I don't know,"" he said good-naturedly; he had never in his life felt so good-natured. ""I suppose I thought we were getting beaten. That rather braces one up, doesn't it?""  ""Ah, that is you English all over,"" laughed Mavorovitch. ""We have a saying, 'In all campaigns the English lose many battles, but they always win one--namely, the last.'""  ""I'm sure it's awfully jolly of you to say so,"" said Winn. ""You play a pretty fine game yourself, you know, considerably more skill in it than mine. I had no idea you were not English yourself.""  Mavorovitch seemed to swim away into a mist of laughter, people receded, the bank receded; at last he stood before her. Winn thought she was a little thinner in the face and her eyes were larger than ever. He could not take his own away from her; he had no thoughts, and he forgot to speak.  Everybody was streaming off to tea. The rink was deserted; it lay a long, gray shadow beneath the high, white banks. The snow had begun to fall, light, dry flakes that rested like powder on Claire's curly hair. She waited for him to speak; but as he still said nothing, she asked with a sudden dimple:  ""Where does this path lead to?""  Then Winn recollected himself, and asked her if she didn't want some tea. Claire shook her head.  ""Not now,"" she said decidedly; ""I want to go along this path.""  Winn obeyed her silently. The path took them between dark fir-trees to the farthest corner of the little park. Far below them a small stream ran into the lake, it was frozen over, but in the silence they could hear it whispering beneath the ice. The world was as quiet as if it lay in velvet. Then Claire said suddenly:  ""Oh, why did you make me hurt him when I liked him so much?""  They found a bench and sat down under the trees.  ""Do you mean you've sent Lionel away?"" Winn asked anxiously.  ""Yes,"" she said in a forlorn little voice; ""yesterday I sent him away. He didn't know I was coming over here, he was very miserable. He asked me if I knew about you--he said he believed you wanted me to--and I said, 'Of course I know everything.' I wasn't going to let him think you hadn't told me. Why did you go away?""  He had not thought she would ask him that. It was as if he saw before him an interminable hill which he had believed himself to have already climbed.  He drew a deep breath, then he said:  ""Didn't they talk about it? I wrote to her, the chaplain's wife I mean; I hadn't time to see her, but I sent it by the porter. I thought she'd do; she seemed a gossipy woman, kept on knitting and gassing over a stove in the hall. I thought she was--a sort of circulating library, you see. I tipped the porter--tow-headed Swiss brute. I suppose he swallowed it.""  ""He went away the same day you did,"" Claire explained. ""Nobody told me anything. Do you think I would have let them? I wouldn't let Lionel, and I knew he had a right to, but I didn't care about anybody's rights. You see, I--I thought you'd tell me yourself. So I came,"" she finished quietly.  She waited. Winn began to draw patterns on the snow with his stick, then he said:  ""I've been a bit of a blackguard not telling you myself. I didn't want to talk about it, and that's a fact. I'm married.""  He kept his face turned away from her. It seemed a long time before she spoke.  ""You should have told me that before,"" she said in a queer, low voice. ""It's too late now.""  ""Would it,"" he asked quickly, ""have made any difference--about Lionel, I mean?""  She shook her head.  ""Not,"" she said, ""about Lionel.""  He bent lower over the pattern in the snow; it had become more intricate.  ""I couldn't tell you,"" he muttered; ""I tried. I couldn't. That was why I went off. You say too late. D'you mind telling me if you mean--you care?""  Her silence seemed interminable, and then he knew she had already answered him. It seemed to him that if he sat there and died, he couldn't speak.  ""Winn,"" she asked in a whisper, ""did you go because of me--or because of you?""  He turned round, facing her.  ""Is that worrying you?"" he asked fiercely. ""Well, you can see for yourself, can't you? All there is of me--"" He could not finish his sentence.  It was snowing heavily. They seemed intensely, cruelly alone. It was as if all life crept off and left them by themselves in the drifting gray snow, in their silent little corner of the unconscious, unalterable world.  Winn put his arm around her and drew her head down on his shoulder.  ""It's all right,"" he said rather thickly. ""I won't hurt you.""  But he knew that he had hurt her, and that it was all wrong.  She did not cry, but she trembled against his heart. He felt her shivering as if she were afraid of all the world but him.  ""I must stay with you,"" she whispered. ""I must stay with you, mustn't I?""  He tried not to say ""always,"" but he thought afterward that he must have said ""always.""  Then she lifted her curls and her little fur cap with the snow on it from his shoulder, and looked deep into his eyes. The worst of it was that hers were filled with joy.  ""Winn,"" she said, ""do you love me enough for anything? Not only for happiness, but, if we had to have dreadful things, enough for dreadful things?""  She spoke of dreadful things as if they were outside her, and as if they were very far away.  ""I love you enough for anything,"" said Winn, gravely.  ""Tell me,"" she whispered, ""did you ever even think--you liked her as much?""  Winn looked puzzled; it took him a few minutes to guess whom she meant, then he said wonderingly:  ""My wife, you mean?""  Claire nodded. It was silly how the little word tore its way into her very heart; she had to bite her lips to keep herself from crying out. She did not realize that the word was meaningless to him.  ""No,"" said Winn, gravely; ""that's the worst of it. I must have been out of my head. It was a fancy. Of course I thought it was all right, but I didn't _care_. It was fun rather than otherwise; you know what I mean? I'm afraid I gave her rather a rotten time of it; but fortunately she doesn't like me at all. It's not surprising.""  ""Yes, it is,"" said Claire, firmly; ""it's very surprising. But if she doesn't care for you, and you don't care for her, can't anything be done?""  There is something cruel in the astonishing ease with which youth believes in remedial measures. It is a cruelty which reacts so terribly upon its possessors.  Winn hesitated; then he told her that he would take her to the ends of the world. Claire pushed away the ends of the world; they did not sound very practical.  ""I mean,"" she said, ""have you got to consider anybody else? Of course there's Maurice and your people, I've thought of them. But I don't think they'd mind so awfully always, do you? It wouldn't be like robbing or cheating some one who really needed us. We couldn't do that, of course.""  Then Winn remembered Peter. He told her somehow that there was Peter. He hid his face against her breast while he told her; he could not bear to see in her eyes this new knowledge of Peter.  But she was very quiet about it; it was almost as if she had always known that there was Peter.  Winn spoke very wildly after that; he denied Peter; he denied any obstacles; he spoke as if they were already safely and securely married. He explained that they had to be together; that was the long and short of it. Anything else was absurd; she must see that it was absurd.  Claire didn't interrupt him once; but when he had quite finished, she said consideringly:  ""Yes; but, after all, she gave you Peter.""  Then Winn laughed, remembering how Estelle had given him Peter. He couldn't explain to Claire quite how funny it was.  She bore his laughter, though it surprised her a little; there seemed to be so many new things to be learned about him. Then she said:  ""Anyway, we can be quite happy for a fortnight, can't we?""  Winn raised his head and looked at her. It was his turn to be surprised.  ""Maurice and I,"" she explained, ""have to go back in two weeks; we've come over here for the fortnight. So we'll just be happy, won't we? And we can settle what we'll do afterward, at the end of the time.""  She spoke as if a fortnight was a long time. Then Winn kissed her; he did it with extraordinary gentleness, on the side of her cheek and on her wet curls covered with snow.  ""You're such a baby,"" he said half to himself; ""so it isn't a bit of use your being as old as the hills the other part of the time. There are just about a million reasons why you shouldn't stay, you know.""  ""Oh, reasons!"" said Claire, making a face at anything so trivial as a reason. Then she became very grave, and said, ""I _want_ to stay, Winn; of course I know what you mean. But there's Maurice; it isn't as if I were alone. And afterwards--oh, Winn, it's because I don't know what is going to happen afterwards--I _must_ have now!""  Winn thought for a moment, then he said:  ""Well, I'll try and work it. You mustn't be in the same hotel, though. Fortunately, I know a nice woman who'll help us through; only, darling, I'm awfully afraid it's beastly wrong for you. I mean I can't explain properly; but if I let you go now, it would be pretty sickening. But you'd get away; and if you stay, I'll do the best I can but we shall get mixed up so that you'll find it harder to shake me off. You see, you're awfully young; there are chances ahead of you, awfully decent other chaps, marriage--""  ""And you,"" she whispered--""you?""  ""Oh, it doesn't matter a damn about me either way,"" he explained carefully. ""I'm stuck. But it isn't really fair of me to let you stay. You don't understand, but it simply isn't fair.""  Claire looked reproachfully at him.  ""If I don't want you to be fair,"" she said, ""you oughtn't to want to be--not more than I do, I mean. Besides--Oh, Winn, I do know about when I go! That's why I _can't_ go till we've been happy, awfully happy, _first_. Don't you see, if I went now, there'd be nothing to look back on but just your being hurt and my being hurt; and I want happiness! Oh, Winn, I want happiness!""  That was the end of it. He took her in his arms and promised her happiness.     PART III     CHAPTER XXIII   It seemed incredible that they should be happy, but from the first of their fortnight to the last they were increasingly, insanely happy. Everything ministered to their joy; the unstinted blue and gold of the skies, the incommunicable glee of mountain heights, their blind and eager love.  There was no future. They were on an island cut off from all to-morrows; but they were together, and their island held the fruits of the Hesperides.  They lived surrounded by light passions, by unfaithfulnesses that had not the sharp excuses of desire, bonds that held only because they would require an effort to break and bonds that were forged only because it was easier to pass into a new relation than to continue in an old one. Their solid and sober passion passed through these light fleets of pleasure-boats as a great ship takes its unyielding way toward deep waters.  Winn was spared the agony of foresight; he could not see beyond her sparkling eyes; and Claire was happy, exultantly, supremely happy, with the reckless, incurious happiness of youth.  It was terrible to see them coming in and out with their joy. Their faces were transfigured, their eyes had the look of sleep-walkers, they moved as through another world. They had only one observer, and to Miss Marley the sight of them was like the sight of those unknowingly condemned to die. St. Moritz in general was not observant. It had gossips, but it did not know the difference between true and false, temporary and permanent. It had one mold for all its fancies: given a man and a woman, it formed at once its general and monotonous conjecture.  Maurice might have noticed Claire's preoccupation, for Maurice was sensitive to that which touched himself, but for the moment a group more expensive and less second rate than he had discovered at Davos took up his entire attention. He had none to spare for his sister unless she bothered him, and she didn't bother him.  It was left to Miss Marley to watch from hour to hour the significant and rising chart of passion. The evening after the Davos match, Winn had knocked at the door of her private sitting-room. It was his intention only to ask her if she would dine with some friends of his from Davos; he would mention indifferently that they were very young, a mere boy and girl, and he would suggest with equal subtlety that he would be obliged if Miss Marley would continue to take meals at his table during their visit. St. Moritz, he saw himself saying, was such a place for talk. There was no occasion to go into anything, and Miss Marley would, of course, have no idea how matters really stood. She was a good sort, but he wasn't going to talk about Claire.  Miss Marley said, ""Come in,"" in that wonderful, low, soft voice of hers that came so strangely from her blistered lips. She was sitting in a low chair, smoking, in front of an open wood fire.  Her room was furnished by herself. It was a comfortable, featureless room, with no ornaments and no flowers; there were plenty of books in cases or lying about at ease on a big table, a stout desk by the window, and several leather-covered, deep armchairs. The walls were bare except for photographs of the Cresta. These had been taken from every possible angle of the run--its banks, its corners, its flashing pieces of straight, and its incredible final hill. It was noticeable that though there was generally a figure on a toboggan in the photograph, it never happened to be one of Miss Marley herself. She was a creditable rider, but she did not, to her own mind, show off the Cresta.  Her eyes met Winn's with a shrewdness that she promptly veiled. He wasn't looking as if he wanted her to be shrewd. It struck her that she was seeing Winn as he must have looked when he was about twenty. She wondered if this was only because he had won the match. His eyes were very open and they were off their guard. It could not be said that Winn had ever in his life looked appealing, but for a Staines to look so exposed to friendliness was very nearly an appeal.  ""Mavorovitch has just left me,"" said Miss Marley. ""You ought to have heard what he said about you. It was worth hearing. You played this afternoon like a successful demon dealing with lost souls. I don't think I've ever seen bandy played quite in that vein before.""  Winn sank into one of the leather armchairs and lighted a cigarette.  ""As a matter of fact,"" he said, ""I played like a fluke. I am not up to Mavorovitch's form at all. I just happened to be on my game; he would have had me down and out otherwise.""  Miss Marley nodded; she was wondering what had put Winn on his game. She turned her eyes away from him and looked into the fire. Winn was resting for the first time that day; the sense of physical ease and her even, tranquil comradeship were singularly soothing to him. Suddenly it occurred to him that he very much liked Miss Marley, and in a way in which he had never before liked any woman, with esteem and without excitement. He gave her a man's first proof of confidence.  ""Look here,"" he said, ""I want you to help me.""  Miss Marley turned her eyes back to him; she was a plain woman, but she was able to speak with her eyes, and though what she said was sometimes hard and always honest, on the present occasion they expressed only an intense reassurance of good-will.  ""When I came in,"" Winn said rather nervously, ""I meant to ask you a little thing, but I find I am going to ask you a big one.""  ""Oh, well,"" said Miss Marley, ""ask away. Big or little, friends should stand by each other.""  ""Yes,"" said Winn, relieved, ""that's what I thought you'd say. I don't know that I ever mentioned to you I'm married?""  ""No,"" she answered quietly, ""I can't say that you did; however, most men of your age are married.""  ""And I've got a son,"" Winn continued. ""His name is Peter--after my father, you know.""  ""That's a good thing,"" she concurred heartily. ""I'm glad you've got a son.""  ""Unfortunately,"" said Winn, ""my marriage didn't exactly come off. We got hold of the wrong end of the stick.""  ""Ah,"" said Miss Marley, ""that's a pity! The right end of the stick is, I believe, almost essential in marriage.""  ""Yes,"" Winn acknowledged; ""I see that now, of course. I was keen on getting her, but I hadn't thought the rest out. Rather odd, isn't it, that you don't get as much as a tip about how jolly a thing could be till you've dished yourself from having it?""  Miss Marley agreed that it was rather odd.  Winn came back swiftly to his point.  ""What I was going to ask you,"" he said, holding her with his eyes, ""is to sit at my table for a bit. I happen to have two young friends of mine over from Davos. He's her brother, of course, but I thought I'd like to have another woman somewhere about. Look better, wouldn't it? She's only nineteen.""  His voice dropped as he mentioned Claire's age as if he were speaking of the Madonna.  ""Yes,"" agreed Miss Marley, ""it would look better.""  ""I dare say,"" said Winn after rather a long pause, ""you see what I mean? The idea is--our idea, you know--to be together as much as we can for a fortnight. It'll be all right, of course; only I rather wondered if you'd see us through.""  ""See you through being all right?"" Miss Marley asked with the directness of a knife-thrust.  ""Well--yes,"" said Winn. ""It would just put people off thinking things. Everybody seems to know you up here, and I somehow thought I'd rather you knew.""  ""Thank you,"" said Miss Marley, briefly.  She turned back to the fire again. She had seen all she wanted to see in Winn's eyes. She saw his intention. What she wasn't sure about was the fortnight. A fortnight can do a good deal with an intention.  Miss Marley knew the world very well. People had often wanted to use her for a screen before, and generally she had refused, believing that the chief safeguard of innocence is the absence of screens. But she saw that Winn did not want her to be that kind of a screen; he wanted her to be in the center of his situation without touching it. He wanted her for Claire, but he wanted her also a little for himself, so that he might feel the presence of her upright friendliness. He intensely trusted her.  There are people who intend to do good in the world and invariably do harm. They enter eagerly into the lives of others and put their fingers pressingly upon delicate machinery; very often they destroy it, more seldom, unfortunately, they cut their own fingers. Miss Marley did not belong to this type. She did not wish to be involved and she was scrupulous never to involve others. She hesitated before she gave her consent, but she couldn't withstand the thought that Claire was only nineteen. She spoke at last.  ""What you suggest,"" she said quietly, ""is going to be rather hard for you both. I suppose you do realize how hard? You see, you are only at the beginning of the fortnight now. Unhappy men and very young girls make difficult situations, Major Staines.""  He got up and walked to the window, standing with his back to her. She wondered if she had said too much; his back looked uncompromising. She did not realize that she could never say too much in the defense of Claire. Then he said, without looking round:  ""We shall have to manage somehow.""  It occurred to Miss Marley, with a wave of reassurance, that this was probably Winn's usual way of managing.  ""In any case,"" she said firmly, ""you can count on me to do anything you wish.""  Winn expressed no gratitude. He merely said:  ""I shall introduce her to you this evening.""  Before he left Miss Marley he shook hands with her. Her hands were hard and muscular, but she realized when she felt his grip that he must have been extremely grateful.     CHAPTER XXIV   They went out early, before the sun was up, when the valley was an apricot mist and the mountains were as white as snowdrops in the spring. The head waiter fell easily into their habits, and provided them with an early breakfast and a parcel for lunch. Then they drove off through the biting, glittering coldness.  Sometimes they went far down the valley to Sils and on to the verge of the Maloja. Sometimes they drove through the narrower valleys to Pontresina and on into the impenetrable winter gloom of the Mortratsch glacier. The end was the same solitude, sunshine, and their love. The world was wrapped away in its winter stillness. The small Swiss villages slept and hardly stirred. In the hot noonday a few drowsy peasants crept to and from the barns where the cattle passed their winter life. Sometimes a woman labored at a frozen pump, or a party of skiers slipped rapidly through the shady streets, rousing echoes with their laughter; but for the most part they were as much alone as if the world had ceased to hold any beings but themselves. The pine-trees scented all the air, the snow dripped reluctantly, and sometimes far off they heard the distant boom of an avalanche. They sat together for long sunlit hours on the rickety wooden balcony of a friendly hospice, drinking hot spiced _gluewein_ and building up their precarious memories.  There were moments when the hollow present snapped under their feet like a broken twig, and then the light in their eyes darkened and they ran out upon the safer path of make-believe.  It was Winn who, curiously enough, began it, and returned to it oftenest. It came to him, this abolishing of Estelle, always more easily than it came to Claire. It was inconceivable to Claire that Winn didn't, as a rule, remember his wife. She could have understood the tragedy of his marriage, but Winn didn't make a tragedy of it, he made nothing of it at all. It seemed terrible to Claire that any woman, bearing his name, the mother of his child, should have no life in his heart. She found herself resenting this for Estelle. She tried to make Winn talk about her, so that she might justify her ways to him. But Winn went no further in his expressions than the simple phrases, ""She's not my sort,"" ""We haven't anything in common,"" ""I expect we didn't hit it off."" Finally he said, terribly, under the persistency of Claire's pressure, ""Well, if you will have it, I don't believe a single word she says.""  ""Oh, but sometimes, sometimes she must speak the truth!"" Claire urged, breathless with pity.  ""I dare say,"" Winn replied indifferently. ""Possibly she does, but what difference does it make to me when I don't know which times?""  Claire waited a little, then she said:  ""I wasn't thinking of the difference to you; I was thinking of the difference to her.""  ""I tell you,"" Winn repeated obstinately, ""that I don't care a hang about the difference to her. People shouldn't tell lies. I don't care that for her!"" He snapped a crumb off the table. He looked triumphantly at Claire, under the impression that he had convinced her of a pleasing fact. She burst into tears.  He tried to take her in his arms, but for a moment she resisted him.  ""Do you _want_ me to love Estelle?"" he asked in desperation.  Claire shook her head.  ""I'd like her--to be loved,"" she said, still sobbing.  Winn looked wonderingly at her.  ""Well, as far as that goes, so would I,"" he observed, with a sardonic grin. ""There'd be some way out for us then.""  Claire shook her head vehemently, but she made no attempt to explain her tears. She felt that she couldn't alter him, and that when he most surprised her it was wiser to accept these surprises than to probe her deep astonishment.  He surprised her very often, he was in such a hurry to unburden himself of all he was. It seemed to him as if he must tell her everything while he had her. He expressed himself as he had never in his wildest dreams supposed that any man could express himself to another human being. He broke down his conventions, he forced aside his restraint, he literally poured out his heart to her. He gave her his opinions, his religion, his codes of conduct, until she began a little to understand his attitude toward Estelle.  It was part of his exterior way of looking at the world at large. Up till now people, except Lionel, had never really entered into his imagination. Of course there were his servants and his dogs and, nearer still, his horses. He spent hours telling her about his horses. They really had come into his life, but never people; even his own family were nothing but a background for wrangles.  He had never known tenderness. He had had all kinds of odd feelings about Peter, but they hadn't got beyond his own mind. His tenderness was beyond everything now; it over-flowed expression. It was the radical thing in him. He showed her plainly that it would break his heart if she were to let her feet get wet. He made plans for her future which would have suited a chronic invalid. He wanted to give her jewels, expensive specimens of spaniels, and a banking account.  She would take nothing from him but a notebook and a little opal ring. Winn restrained his passion, but out of revenge for his restraint his fancies ran wild.  It was Claire who had to be practical; she who had spent her youth in dreams now clung desperately to facts. She read nothing, she hardly talked, but she drew his very soul out to meet her listening soul. There were wonders within wonders to her in Winn. She had hardly forced herself to accept his hardness when she discovered in him a tolerance deeper than anything she had ever seen, and an untiring patience. He had pulled men out of holes only to see them run back into them with the swiftness of burrowing rabbits; but nothing made him feel as if he could possibly give them up.  ""You can't tell how many new starts a man wants,"" he explained to Claire; ""but he ought to have as many as he can take. As long as a man wants to get on, I think he ought to be helped.""  His code about a man's conduct to women was astonishingly drastic.  ""If you've let a woman in,"" he explained, ""you've got to strip yourself to get her out, no matter whether you care for her or not. The moment a woman gets caught out, you can't do too much for her. It's like seeing a dog with a tin can tied to its tail; you've got to get it off. A man ought to pay for his fun; even if it isn't his fault, he ought to pay just the same. It's not so much that he's the responsible person, but he's the least _had_. That ought to settle the question.""  He was more diffident, but not less decided, on the subject of religion.  ""If there's a God at all,"" he stated, ""He must be good; otherwise you can't explain goodness, which doesn't pay and yet always seems worth having. You know what I mean. Not that I am a religious man myself, but I like the idea. Women certainly ought to be religious.""  He hoped that Claire would go regularly to church unless it was draughty.  It was on the Bernina, when they were nine thousand feet up in a blue sky, beyond all sight or sound of life, in their silent, private world, that they talked about death.  ""Curious,"" Winn said, ""how little you think about it when you're up against it. I shouldn't like to die of an illness. That's all I've ever felt about it; that would be like letting go. I don't think I could let go easily; but just a proper, decent knock-out--why, I don't believe you'd know anything about it. I never felt afraid of chucking it, till I knew you, now I'm afraid.""  Claire looked at his strong hands in the sunshine and at her own which lay on his; they looked so much alive! She tried hard to think about death, because she knew that some day everybody must die; but she felt as if she was alive forever.  ""Yes,"" she said; ""of course I suppose we _shall_. But, Winn, don't you think that we could send for each other then? Wouldn't that be splendid?""  The idea of death became suddenly a shortening of the future; it was like something to look forward to. Winn nodded gravely, but he didn't seem to take the same comfort in it that Claire did. He only said:  ""I dare say we could manage something. But you feel all right, don't you?""  Claire laughed until something in his grave eyes hurt her behind her laughter.  The sky changed from saffron to dead blue and then to startling rose color. Flame after flame licked the Bernina heights. Their sleigh-bells rang persistently beneath them. They drank their coffee hurriedly while the sun sank out of the valley, and the whole world changed into an icy light.  They drove off rapidly down the pass, wrapped in furs and clinging to each other. They did not know what anything would mean when they were apart. The thought of separation was like bending from a sunny world over a well of darkness. Claire cried a little, but not very much. She never dared let herself really cry because of what might happen to Winn.  It surprised him sometimes how little she tried to influence his future life. She did not make him promise anything except to go to see Dr. Gurnet. He wondered afterward why she had left so much to his discretion when he had made so many plans, and urgent precautions for her future; and yet he knew that when she left him he would be desperate enough to break any promises and never desperate enough to break her trust in him. Suddenly he said to her as the darkness of the pass swallowed them:  ""Look here, I won't take to drink. I'd like to, but I won't."" And Claire leaned toward him and kissed him, and he said a moment later, with a little half laugh:  ""D'you know, I rather wish you hadn't done that. You never have before, and I sha'n't be able to forget it. You put the stopper on to that intention.""  And Claire said nothing, smiling into the darkness.     CHAPTER XXV   Claire had never been alone with Miss Marley before; she had known her only as an accompaniment to Winn; but she had been aware, even in these partial encounters, that she was being benevolently judged. It must be owned that earlier in the day she had learned, with a sinking of the heart, that she must give up the evening to Miss Marley. When every hour counted as a victory over time, she could not understand how Winn could let her go; and yet he had said quite definitely: ""I want you to go to Miss Marley this evening. She'd like to talk to you, and I think you'd better.""  But something happened which changed her feelings. Miss Marley was a woman despite the Cresta and there are times when only a woman's judgment can satisfy the heart of a girl. Claire was startled and perturbed by Maurice's sudden intervention. Maurice said:  ""That chap Staines is getting you talked about. Pretty low down of him, as I believe he's married."" She was pulled up short in the golden stream of her love. She saw for the first time the face of opinion--that hostile, stupid, interfering face. Claire had never thought that by any malign possibility they could be supposed to be doing wrong. She could not connect wrong with either her love or Winn's. If there was one quality more than another which had distinguished it, it had been its simple sense of rightness. She had seen Winn soften and change under it as the hard earth changes at the touch of spring. She had felt herself enriched and enlarged, moving more unswervingly than ever toward her oldest prayer--that she might, on the whole, be good. She hardly prayed at all about Winn; loving him was her prayer.  If she had meant to take him away from Estelle or to rob him of Peter, then she knew she would have been wrong. But in this fortnight she was taking nothing from Estelle that Estelle had ever had, and she was doing no harm to Peter. It would not be likely to do him any harm to soften his father's heart.  Claire's morality consisted solely in the consideration of other people; her instincts revolted against unkindness. It was an early Christian theory much lost sight of, ""Love, and do as you please,"" the safety of the concession resting upon the quality of the love.  But to-night another idea had occurred to her, and she was very uneasy. Was it really possible that any one could blame Winn? Her first instinct had been sheer anger, and her anger had carried her past fear into the pride of love. She had felt as if she wanted to confront the world and defy it. If the world dared judge them, what did it matter? Their hearts were clean. She was too young to know that under the world's judgments clean hearts break even more easily than soiled ones.  But her mind had not rested there. She had begun to be afraid for Winn, and with all her heart she longed to see him justified. What had he ever done that he could be judged? He had loved her, spared her, guarded her. He had made, he was making, inconceivable sacrifices for her. He was killing not only his own joy, but hers rather than do her what he thought a wrong.  She sat on a footstool in front of Miss Marley's wood fire, frowning at the flames. Miss Marley watched her cautiously; there was a good deal she wanted to say, but she hoped that most of it might be said by Claire. A very careful talker can get a good deal expressed in this way; impressions, to be permanent, must always come from the person you wish to impress.  ""Miss Marley,"" Claire began, ""do you think it matters what people _think_?""  Miss Marley, who invariably rolled her own cigarettes, took up a small silver box, flattened the cigarette-paper out carefully, and prepared to fill it before answering. Then she said:  ""Very few people do think; that is generally what matters--absence of thought. Speech without thought is responsible for most people's disasters.""  ""But it can't matter what people say if it isn't true, can it?"" Claire persisted. ""I mean--_nonsense_ can't _count_ against any one?""  ""I'm rather afraid it does matter,"" said Miss Marley, lighting her cigarette. ""Nonsense is very infectious, and it often carries a good deal of weight. I have known nonsense break people's hearts.""  ""Oh!"" said Claire in a rising breath. She was wondering what it was like to have a broken heart. Somewhere in the back of her mind she knew that she was going to have one, half of one; but what really frightened her was that the other half was going to belong to Winn.  ""Could any one,"" she said under her breath, ""think any harm of him? He told me you knew all about us, and that I might talk to you if I wanted to; but I didn't then. There didn't seem anything to say. But now I do want to know; I want to know awfully what you think. If I asked him, he'd only laugh or else he'd be angry. He's very young in some ways, you know, Miss Marley--younger than I am.""  ""Yes,"" agreed Miss Marley; ""men are always, to the end of their lives, very young in some ways.""  ""I never thought,"" Claire went on breathlessly, ""that people would dream of blaming him because we were together. Why, it's so stupid! If they only knew! He's so good!""  ""If he's that,"" said Miss Marley, smiling into the fire, ""you've succeeded in making a saint of a Staines, a very difficult experiment! I shouldn't advise you to run away too much with that idea, however.""  ""It isn't me; it's him,"" exclaimed Claire, regardless of grammar. ""I mean, after what Maurice said this afternoon--I don't know how to put it quite--I almost wish we'd both been bad!""  Miss Marley nodded. She knew the danger of blame when a tug of war is in progress, and how it weakens the side attacked.  ""How can I explain to people,"" Claire went on, ""what he's been like? I don't know whether I've told you, but he went away almost directly he found out he cared, before--long before he knew I cared, though he might have known; and he left a message to tell me about his wife, which I never got. But, oh, Miss Marley, I've never told him, I should have come if I'd got it or not! I should really, because I _had_ to know if he cared! So you see, don't you, that if either of us was wicked it was me? Only I didn't _feel_ wicked; I really felt awfully good. I don't see how you're to tell what's right if God doesn't let you know and people talk nonsense.""  ""It's not,"" agreed Miss Marley, dryly, ""particularly easy to know.""  ""And his wife doesn't care for him,"" Claire went on. ""Fancy Winn's wife not caring for him! Poor woman!""  ""Why do you pity her?"" Miss Marley inquired with interest.  ""Well,"" said Claire, with a sudden dimple, ""I was only thinking I shouldn't like to be Winn's wife if he didn't care for me; and then I was thinking that if he didn't, I'd make him!""  ""Well, that effort doesn't seem required of you,"" said Miss Marley.  ""No, but it only shows you that I'm much the most wicked, doesn't it?"" asked Claire, with some pride.  ""The points against Winn,"" Miss Marley said gravely, ""are his age, his experience, and his wife. I feel bound to tell you that there are points against him.""  Claire frowned.  ""Winn isn't really old,"" she explained, ""because he's only done things all his life--games or his work; it hasn't been people. People make you old, especially when you are looking after them. He's never really grown up; and as for experience, I don't think you experience anything unless you care about it. It hurts me sometimes to hear him talk about his wife. He's never _had_ her; he's only had me. I don't explain very well, but I know it's true, because he told me things about loving which showed me he'd never had anything before except dogs--and Peter; and Peter's awfully young, and dogs can't answer back. You can't grow up on dogs.""  Miss Marley tacitly admitted the limitations of canine influence; but she said:  ""Still, you know, he's not kept to his own code; that's what one must judge people by. I'm sure he'd tell you himself that a married man should leave girls alone.""  Claire thought for a moment, then she said:  ""Yes, but he's gone deeper than his code now. Don't you think that perhaps a smash, even of something you value, makes you grow? I don't know how to put it quite, but if you never did what you thought wrong, would you ever know how big right is? Besides, he hasn't gone on doing it. Perhaps he _did_ start wrong in getting to care, but that only makes it harder and finer, his stopping himself. Very few people, I think, but Winn could stop themselves, and nobody but Winn could ever care--so much."" Her voice broke, and she turned away her head.  ""What,"" said Miss Marley, rolling another cigarette, ""are your plans?""  Miss Marley felt that she must give up first principles but she hoped that she might still be able to do something about plans.  ""We are going to drive over the Maloja to Chiavenna,"" said Claire; ""Maurice has a party to go with. We shall start by the earlier post, and have lunch together at Vico-Soprano before he comes. And then when Maurice comes we shall say good-by; and then--and then, Miss Marley, I've been thinking--we mustn't meet again! I haven't told Winn yet, because he likes to talk as if we could, in places awfully far away and odd, with you to chaperon us. I think it helps him to talk like that but I don't think now that we must ever meet again. You won't blame him if I tell you something, will you?""  ""No,"" said Miss Marley; ""after what you've said to me to-night I am not inclined to blame him.""  ""Well,"" said Claire, ""I don't think, if we were to meet again, he would let me go. We may manage this time, but not twice.""  ""Are you sure,"" asked Miss Marley, gently, ""that you will manage this time?""  Claire raised her head and looked at Miss Marley.  ""Aren't you?"" she said gravely. ""I _did_ feel very sure.""  ""I'd feel a great deal surer,"" said Miss Marley, ""if you didn't drive down the pass. If you once set off with Winn, do you suppose he'll stop? I am sure he means to now; in fact, his sending you up here to talk to me proves it. He knows I sha'n't be much of a help to him in carrying you off. But, my dear, I never knew any Staines stop, once he'd started. As long as he is looking at the consequences for you, he'll steer clear of them, he's looking at them now, but a moment will come when he'll cease to look, and then everything will depend on you. I think your one chance is to say good-by here, and to drive down the pass with Maurice. He can dispose of his party for once.""  The color left Claire's face, but her eyes never flinched from Miss Marley's. After a time Miss Marley turned her head away; she could no longer bear the look in Claire's eyes. It was like watching the face of some one drowning.  ""I don't want a chance!"" whispered Claire.  [Illustration: ""I don't want a chance,"" whispered Claire]  Miss Marley found her voice difficult to control, but she did control it; she said:  ""I was thinking of his chance. If he does you any harm, he won't forgive himself. You can stop it; he can't possibly stop himself.""  ""No,"" said Claire. She didn't cry; she sat very straight and still on her footstool in front of the fire. After a while she said in a curious dragging voice: ""Very well, then; I must tell him about the pass. Oh, what shall I do if he minds! It's his minding--"" She stopped, as if the words broke something in her.  ""Yes,"" said Miss Marley; ""but he'll mind more if he ruins your life. You see, you won't think you're ruined, but Winn will think so. He'll believe he's ruined the woman he loves, and after a little time, when his passion has ceased to ride him blind, he'll never hold up his head again. You'll be responsible for that."" It sounded cruel, but it was not cruel. Miss Marley knew that as long as she laid the responsibility at Claire's door, Claire would not think her cruel.  Claire repeated slowly after her:  ""I should be responsible for that!"" Then she said: ""Oh, how silly laws are! How silly! As if any one could be ruined who simply loved!""  ""We should probably be sillier without laws,"" Miss Marley observed. ""And you must remember they have their recommendations: they keep silly people comparatively safe.""  ""Safe!"" said Claire. ""I think that's the emptiest, poorest word there is! Who wants to be safe?""  ""You wouldn't think so if you had a child,"" said Miss Marley, quietly. ""You would need safety then, and you would learn to prize it.""  Claire bowed her head into her hands.  ""Oh, why can't I have one now! Why can't I?"" she whispered brokenly.  Miss Marley bit her lips; she had hoped Claire was too young for this particular stab.  ""Because he'd think it wrong,"" said Miss Marley after a pause, ""and because of Peter. He's got that obligation. The two would clash.""  Claire rose slowly to her feet.  ""I'll just go and tell him about the pass,"" she said quietly. ""When it's over I'll begin to think; but I needn't really think till then, need I? Because I feel as if I couldn't just now; it would stop my going on.""  Miss Marley said that she was quite sure that Claire need not begin to think at present and privately she hoped that, when that hour came, something might happen which would deaden thought. She was thankful to remember that the worst of feeling is always over before the worst of thinking can begin. But Claire was too young to comfort herself with the limitations of pain. She only knew that she must tell Winn about the pass and seem for a moment at least, in his eyes, not to trust him. Nevertheless, she smiled at Miss Marley before she left her, because she didn't want Miss Marley to feel upset; and Miss Marley accepted this reassurance with an answering smile until the door was shut.     CHAPTER XXVI   When Claire found Winn at the bridge-table she saw at a glance that he was not in the mood for renunciations. His eyes had the hard, shining stare that was the danger-signal of the Staines family. He shot a glance at Claire as if she were a hostile force and he was taking her measure. He was putting her outside himself in order to fight her. It was as if he knew instinctively that their wills were about to clash. When the rubber was over, he got up and walked straight to her.  ""You put me off my game,"" he said grimly. ""I can see you're up to something; but we can't talk here.""  ""Let's talk to-morrow,"" she urged, ""not now. I thought perhaps you'd like to come and listen to the music with me; there is music in the hall.""  ""You did, did you?"" he replied in the same hard voice. ""Well, you were mistaken. Go up-stairs to my room and wait for me. It's number 28, two or three doors beyond Miss Marley's sitting-room. I'll follow you.""  An older woman would have hesitated, and if Claire had hesitated, Winn would never have forgiven her. But her youth was at once her danger and her protection.  She would rather have waited till to-morrow, because she saw that Winn was in a difficult mood; but she had no idea what was behind his mood. She went at once.  She had never been in Winn's room before, and as she sat down to wait for him her eyes took in its neat impressive bareness. It was a narrow hotel room, a bed in one corner, a chest of drawers, washstand, and wardrobe opposite. By the balcony window were a small table and an armchair. A cane chair stood at the foot of the bed.  Nothing was lying about. There were few traces of occupation visible; only a pair of felt slippers under the bed, a large bath sponge on the washstand, and a dressing-gown hanging on the nail behind the door. In his tooth-glass by the bedside was a rose Claire had worn and given him. It was put there with meticulous care; its stalk had been re-cut and its leaves freshened. Beside it lay a small New Testament and a book on saddles.  Winn joined her in exactly five minutes. He shut the door carefully after him, and sat down on the cane chair opposite her.  ""I thought you might like to know,"" he said politely, ""that I have made up my mind not to let you go.""  Then he waited for Claire to contradict him. But Claire waited, too; Claire waited longest. She was not sure what to say, and, unlike most women, when she was not sure what to say, she said nothing. Winn spoke again, but a little less quietly.  ""It's no use your making a fuss,"" he stated, ""or cutting up rough about it and throwing morals at my head. I've got past that."" He got up, locked the door, and then came back. ""I'm going to keep that door locked until I make sure what you're up to.""  ""You needn't have done that,"" Claire said quietly. ""Do you think I want to leave you? If I did, I shouldn't be here. You can't make me do anything I don't want to do, because I want exactly what you do.""  Winn shot an appreciative glance at her; that was a good stroke, but he wasn't going to be taken in by it. In some ways he would have preferred to see her angry. Hostility is generally the sign of weakness; but Claire looked at him with an unyielding tenderness.  ""The question is,"" he said firmly, ""can I make you do what we both want and what you are holding back from? I dare say you've got good reasons for holding back and all that, and I know I'm an out-and-out blackguard to press you, but I've reached a place where I won't stand any more. D'you see my point?""  Claire nodded. She was not angry, because she saw that Winn was fighting her not because he wanted to be victorious over her, but because he was being conquered by pain.  She was not going to let him be conquered by it--that, as Miss Marley had said, was her responsibility--but it wasn't going to be easy to prevent it. She was close against the danger-line, and every nerve in her being had long ago become part of Winn. He was fighting against the best of himself, but all that was not the best of Claire fought on his side. Perhaps there was not very much that was not the best in Claire. She hesitated, then she said:  ""I thought you wanted me--to go. I think you really do want it; that's why I'm going.""  Winn leaned forward and took hold of both her wrists. ""So I did,"" he agreed; ""but it isn't any good. I can't do it. I've thought it all out--just what to do, you know--for both of us. I'll have to leave my regiment, of course, but I can get back into something else all right later on. Estelle will give me a divorce. She'll want to keep the child away from me; besides, she'll like to be a public martyr. As for you and me, you'll have to face rough music for a year or two; that's the worst part of it. I'm sorry. We'll stay abroad till it's over. My mother will help us. I can count on her.""  ""Winn, come here,"" said Claire. He came and knelt down beside her. She put her hands on his shoulders and looked deep into his eyes. He tried to keep them hard, but he failed.  ""Don't try and get round me!"" he said threateningly. ""You'll make me dangerous if you do. It isn't the least good!""  ""Can you listen to what I say?"" Claire asked quietly.  ""I suppose so,"" said Winn, guardedly. ""I love every bit of you--I love the ground your chair's on--but I'm not going to give in.""  ""And that's the way I love you,"" she said. ""I'd go with you to the world's end, Winn, if I didn't love you so much and you'd take me there; but you won't, for just the same reason. We can't do what would be unfair; we shouldn't like it. It's no use, darling; we shouldn't like it.""  ""That's all you know about it,"" said Winn, unappeasably. ""Anyhow, we're going to do it, whether you like it or not.""  Then she took her hands away from his shoulders and leaned back in her chair. He had never seen her look so frail and small, and he knew that she had never been so formidably strong.  ""Oh, no, Winn,"" she whispered; ""I'm not. I'm not going to do it. If you wanted it, if you really wanted it with all of you, you wouldn't be rough with me; you'd be gentle. You're not being gentle because you don't think it right, and I'm never going to do what you don't think right.""  Winn drew a deep, hard breath. He threw his arms round her and pressed her against his heart.  ""I'm _not_ rough,"" he muttered, ""and you've got to do it! You've got to give in!""  Claire made no answer. She only clung to him, and every now and then she said his name under her breath as if she were calling to something in him to save her.  Whatever it was that she was calling to answered her. He suddenly bowed his head and buried it in her lap. She felt his body shake, and he began to sob, hard, dry sobs that broke him as they came. He held her close, with his face hidden. Claire pressed her hands on each side of his temples, feeling the throbbing of his heart. She felt as if something inside her were being torn to pieces, something that knocked its way against her side in a vain endeavor to escape. She very nearly gave in. Then Winn stopped as suddenly as he had begun.  ""Sorry,"" he said, ""but this kind of thing is a bit wearing. I'm not going to unlock that door. Do you intend to stay all night here, or give me your promise?"" He spoke steadily now; his moment of weakness was past. She could have gone then, but nothing would have induced her to leave him while he cried.  ""I don't intend to do either,"" Claire said with equal steadiness. ""When you think I ought to go, you'll let me out.""  It struck Winn that her knowledge of him was positively uncanny.  ""I don't believe,"" he said sharply, ""you're only nineteen. I believe you've been in love before!""  Claire didn't say anything, but she looked past him at the door.  Her look maddened him.  ""You're playing with me!"" he cried. ""By Jove! you're playing with me!"" He caught her by the shoulders, and for a moment he believed that he was going to kill her; but her eyes never wavered. He was not hurting her, and she knew that he never would. She said:  ""O my darling boy!""  Winn got up and walked to the window. When he came back, his expression had completely changed.  ""Now cut along to bed,"" he said quietly. ""You're tired. Go--at once, Claire.""  This time she knew she ought to go, but something held her back. She was not satisfied with the look in his eyes. He was controlled again, but it was a controlled desperation. She could not leave him with that.  Her mind was intensely alert with pain; she followed his eyes. They rested for a moment on the stand by his bed. He pushed the key across the table toward her, but she did not look at the key; she crossed the room and opened the drawer under the Bible.  She saw what she had expected to see. It was Winn's revolver; upon it lay a snap-shot of Peter. He always kept them together.  Claire took out the revolver. Winn watched her, with his hands in his pockets.  ""Be careful,"" he said; ""it's loaded.""  She brought it to him and said:  ""Now take all the things out of it."" Winn laughed, and unloaded it without a word. ""Now open the window,"" she ordered, ""and throw them into the snow."" Winn obeyed. When he came back she put her arms around his neck and kissed him. ""Now I'll go,"" she said.  ""All right,"" agreed Winn, gently. ""Wait for me in the cloak-room, and I'll take you across. But, I say, look here--will you ever forgive me? I'm afraid I've been a most fearful brute.""  Then Claire knew she couldn't stand any more. She turned and ran into the passage. Fortunately, the cloak-room was empty. She pressed herself against a fur coat and sobbed as Winn had sobbed up-stairs; but she had not his arms to comfort her. She had not dared to cry in his arms.  They walked hand in hand across the snow from his hotel to the door of hers.  Claire knew that she could say anything she liked to Winn now, so she said what she had made up her mind to say.  ""Winn dearest, do you know what I came down for this evening?""  He held her hand tighter and nodded.  ""I guessed,"" he said. ""That was, you know, what rather did for me. You mean you aren't going to let me come with you down the pass?""  ""We mustn't,"" Claire whispered; and then she felt she couldn't be good any more. It cost too much. So she added, ""But you can if you like."" But there wasn't any real need for Claire to be good now; Winn was good instead.  ""No,"" he said; ""it's much wiser not. You look thoroughly done up. I'm not going to have any more of this. Let's breakfast together. You come over at eight sharp and arrange with Maurice to take you down at ten. That's quite enough for you.""  Claire laughed. Winn stared at her, then in a moment he laughed, too.  ""We'd better not take any more chances,"" he explained. ""Next time it might happen to us both together. Then you'd really be had! Thanks awfully for seeing me through. Good night.""  She went into the hotel without a word, and all her heart rebelled against her for having seen him through.     CHAPTER XXVII   The hour of parting crept upon them singularly quietly and slowly. They both pretended to eat breakfast, and then they walked out into Badrutt's Park. They sat in the nearest shelter, hand in hand, looking over the gray, empty expanse of the rink. It was too early for any one to be about. Only a few Swiss peasants were sweeping the ice and Winn hardly looked upon Swiss peasants as human.  He asked Claire exactly how much money she had a year, and told her when she came of age what he should advise her to suggest to her trustees to put it in.  Then he went through all the things he thought she ought to have for driving down the pass. Claire interrupted him once to remind him about going to see Dr. Gurnet. Winn said he remembered quite well and would go. They both assured each other that they had had good nights. Winn said he thought Maurice would be all right in a few years, and that he didn't think he was shaping for trouble. He privately thought that Maurice was not going to have any shape at all, but he omitted this further reflection.  He told her how much he enjoyed his regiment and explained laboriously how Claire was to think of his future, which was to be, apparently, a whirl of pleasure from morning till night.  They talked very disconnectedly; in the middle of recounting his future joys, Winn said:  ""And then if anything was to happen to me, you know, I hope you'd think better of it and marry Lionel.""  Claire did not promise to marry Lionel, but she implied that even without marriage she, like Winn, was about to pass into an existence studded with resources and amusements; and then she added:  ""And if you were to die, or I was, Miss Marley could help us to see each other just at the last. I asked her about it."" Despite their future happiness, they seemed to draw more solid satisfaction out of this final privilege.  The last ten minutes they hardly talked at all. Every now and then Winn wanted to know if Claire's feet were warm, and Claire asked him to let her have a photograph of Peter.  Then Maurice came out of the hotel, and a tailing party stood in the open doorway and wondered if it was going to snow. The sleigh drove up to the hotel, jingling in the gayest manner, with pawing horses. Winn walked across the courtyard with her and nodded to Maurice; and Maurice allowed Winn to tuck Claire up, because, after he'd looked at Winn's eyes, it occurred to him that he couldn't do anything else.  Winn reduced the hall porter, a magnificent person in gold lace, with an immense sense of dignity, to gibbering terror before the lift-boy and the boots because he had failed to supply the sleigh with a sufficiently hot foot-warmer.  Finally even Winn was satisfied that there was nothing more to eat or to wear which the sleigh could be induced to hold or Claire agree to want. He stood aside then, and told the man briefly to be off. The driver, who did not understand English, understood perfectly what Winn meant, and hastened to crack his whip.  Claire looked back and saw Winn, bare-headed, looking after her. His eyes were like a mother's eyes when she fights in naked absorption against the pain of her child.  He went on looking like that for a long while after the sleigh had disappeared. Then he put on his cap and started off up the valley toward Pontresina.  It had already begun to snow. The walk to Pontresina is the coldest and darkest of winter walks, and the snow made it heavy going. Winn got very much out of breath, and his chest hurt him. Every now and then he stopped and said to himself, ""By Jove! I wonder if I'm going to be ill?"" But as he always pushed on afterward with renewed vigor, as if a good idea had just occurred to him, it hardly seemed as if he cared very much whether he was going to be ill or not. He got as far as the Mortratsch Glacier before he stopped.  He couldn't get any farther because when he got into the inn for lunch, something or other happened to him. A fool of a porter had the impertinence to tell him afterward that he had fainted. Winn knocked the porter down for daring to make such a suggestion; but feeling remarkably queer despite this relaxation, he decided to drive back to the Kulm.  He wound up the day with bridge and a prolonged wrangle with Miss Marley on the subject of the Liberal Government.  Miss Marley lent herself to the fray and became extremely heated. Winn had her rather badly once or twice, and as he never subsequently heard her argue on the same subject with others, he was spared the knowledge that she shared his political views precisely, and had tenderly provided him with the flaws in her opponent's case.  When he went to bed he began a letter to Claire. He told her that he had had a jolly walk, a good game of bridge, and that he thought he'd succeeded in knocking some radical nonsense out of Miss Marley's head. Then he inclosed his favorite snap-shot of Peter, the one that he kept with his revolver, and said he would get taken properly with him when he went back to England.  Winn stopped for a long time after that, staring straight in front of him; then he wrote:  ""I hope you'll never be sorry for having come across me, because you've given me everything I ever wanted. I hope you'll not mind my having been rather rough the other night. I didn't mean anything by it. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head; but I think you know that I wouldn't, only I thought I'd just mention it. Please be careful about the damp when you get back to England.""  He stopped for half an hour when he had got as far as ""England,"" and as the heating was off, the room grew very cold; then he wrote, ""I didn't know men loved women like this.""  After that he decided to finish the letter in the morning; but when the morning came he crossed the last sentence out because he thought it might upset her.     CHAPTER XXVIII   He had been afraid that Davos would be beautiful, but the thaw had successfully dissipated its immaculate loveliness. Half of the snow slopes were already bare, the roads were a sea of mud, and the valley was as dingy as if a careless washerwoman had upset a basket of dirty linen on her way to the laundry. All the sport people had gone, the streets were half empty, and most of the tourist shops were shut. Only the very ill had reappeared; they crept aimlessly about in the sunshine with wonder in their eyes that they were still alive.  Winn had put up at the nearest hotel and made the earliest possible appointment with Dr. Gurnet. Dr. Gurnet was obviously pleased to see him, but the pleasure faded rapidly from his face after a glance or two at Winn. The twinkle remained in his eyes, but it had become perceptibly grimmer.  ""Perhaps you would be so kind as to take off your things,"" he suggested. ""After I have examined you we can talk more at our ease.""  It seemed to Winn as if he had never been so knocked about before. Dr. Gurnet pounced upon him and went over him inch by inch; he reminded Winn of nothing so much as of an excited terrier hunting up and down a bank for a rat-hole. Eventually Dr. Gurnet found his rat. He went back to his chair, sat down heavily, and looked at Winn. For rather an ominous moment he was silent; then he said politely:  ""Of course I suppose you are aware, Major Staines, of what you have done with your very excellent chances?""  Winn shook his head doubtfully. He hadn't, as a matter of fact, thought much lately about these particular chances.  ""Ah,"" said Dr. Gurnet, ""then I regret to inform you that you have simply walked through them--or, in your case, I should be inclined to imagine, tobogganed--and you have come out the other side. You haven't got any chances now.""  Winn did not say anything for a moment or two; then he observed:  ""I'm afraid I've rather wasted your time.""  ""Pray don't mention it,"" said Dr. Gurnet. ""It is so small a thing compared with what you have done with your own.""  Winn laughed.  ""You rather have me there,"" he admitted; ""I suppose I have been rather an ass.""  ""My dear fellow,"" said Dr. Gurnet, more kindly, ""I'm really annoyed about this, extremely annoyed. I had booked you to get well. I expected it. What have you been doing with yourself? You've broken down that right lung badly; the infection has spread to the left. It was not the natural progress of the disease, which was in process of being checked; it is owing to a very great and undue physical strain, and absolutely no attempt to take precautions after it. Also you have, I should say, complicated this by a great nervous shock.""  ""Nonsense!"" said Winn, briefly. ""I don't go in for nerves.""  ""You must allow me to correct you,"" said Dr. Gurnet, gently. ""You are a human being, and all human beings are open to the effects of shock.""  ""I'm afraid I haven't quite played the game,"" Winn confessed, after a short pause. ""I hadn't meant to let you down like this, Doctor Gurnet. I think it is due to me to tell you that I shouldn't have come to you for orders if I had intended at the time to shirk them. You're quite right about the tobogganing: I had a go at the Cresta. I know it shook me up a bit, but I didn't spill. Perhaps something went wrong then.""  ""And why, may I ask, did you do it?"" Dr. Gurnet asked ironically. ""You did not act solely, I presume, from an idea of thwarting my suggestions?""  Winn's eyes moved away from the gimlets opposite them.  ""I found time dragging on my hands, rather,"" he explained a trifle lamely.  ""Ah,"" said Dr. Gurnet, ""you should have done what I told you--you should have flirted; then you wouldn't have found time hanging on your hands.""  Winn held his peace. He thought Dr. Gurnet had a right to be annoyed, so he gave him his head; but he had an uncomfortable feeling that Dr. Gurnet would make a very thorough use of this concession.  Dr. Gurnet watched Winn silently for a few moments, then he said:  ""People who don't wish to get well don't get well; but, on the other hand, it is very rare that people who wish to die die. They merely get very ill and give everybody a great deal of highly unnecessary trouble.""  ""I'm not really seedy yet,"" Winn said apologetically. ""I suppose you couldn't give me any idea of how things are going to go--I mean how long I've--"" he hesitated for a few seconds; he felt as if he'd been brought up curiously short--""I've got to live,"" he finished firmly.  ""I can give you some idea, of course,"" said Dr. Gurnet; ""but if you take any more violent or irregular plunges, you may very greatly shorten your time. Should you insist on remaining in your regiment and doing your work, you have, I fancy, about two years more before a complete breakdown. You are a very strong man, and your lung-tissue is tough. Should you remain here under my care, you will live indefinitely, but I can hold out no hope of an ultimate recovery. If you return to England as an invalid, you will most undoubtedly kill yourself from boredom, though I have a suggestion to make to you which I hope may prevent this termination to your career. On the whole, though I fear advice is wasted upon you, I should recommend you to remain in the army. It is what I should do myself if I were unfortunate enough to have your temperament while retaining my own brains.""  ""Oh, yes,"" said Winn, rising to go; ""of course I sha'n't chuck the army. I quite see that's the only sensible thing to do.""  ""Pray sit down again,"" said Dr. Gurnet, blandly, ""and do not run away with the idea that I think any course you are likely to pursue sensible in itself. If you were a sensible man, you would not take personal disappointment as if it were prussic acid.""  Winn started.  ""It isn't disappointment,"" he said quickly; ""it was the only thing to do.""  ""Ah, well,"" said Dr. Gurnet, ""Heaven forbid that I should enter into a controversy with any one who believes in moral finality! Sensible people compromise, Major Staines; but do not be offended, for I have every reason to believe that sensible people do not make the best soldiers. I am asking you to remain for a few minutes further because there is one other point to which I wish to draw your attention should you be able to spare me the time?""  ""All right,"" said Winn, with a short laugh; ""I've got time enough, according to you; I've got two years.""  ""Well, yes,"" said Dr. Gurnet, drawing the tips of his fingers carefully together. ""And, Major Staines, according to me you will--er--need them.""  Winn sat up.  ""What d' you mean?"" he asked quickly.  ""Men in my position,"" replied Dr. Gurnet, guardedly, ""have very interesting little side-lights into the mentality of other nations. I don't know whether you remember my asking you if you knew German?""  ""Yes,"" said Winn. ""It went out of head; but now you speak of it, I do remember.""  ""I am delighted,"" said Dr. Gurnet, blandly, ""to have reconstructed your brain-tissue up to that point. I had a certain reason for asking you this question. I have a good many German patients, some French ones, and a most excellent Belgian professor has placed himself under my care.""  ""Well, what about it?"" asked Winn with some sharpness. He had an idea that this queer fellow before him meant something.  ""The Germans are an interesting nation,"" Dr. Gurnet proceeded without hurrying, ""and they have a universal hobby. I don't know whether you have noticed, Major Staines, but a universal hobby is a very powerful thing. I am sometimes rather sorry that with us it has wholly taken the form of athletic sports. I dare say you are going to tell me that with you it is not golf, but polo; even this enlarged idea does not wholly alter my depression.  ""With the Germans, you see, the hobby happens to be man[oe]uvers--military man[oe]uvers. I understand that this spring Alsace and Lorraine have taken on the aspect of one gigantic camp. Now, Belgium,"" Dr. Gurnet proceeded, tapping Winn's knee with his fore-finger, ""is a small, flat, undefended country, and one of my French patients informs me that the French Government have culpably neglected their northern line of forts.  ""I hear from my other friend, the Belgian professor, that three years ago the Belgian Government ordered big fortress guns from Krupp. They have not got them yet; but I do not believe Krupp is incapable of turning out guns. On the contrary, I hear that Krupp has, in a still shorter time, entirely renovated the artillery of the Austrian army.""  Winn leaned forward excitedly.  ""I say, sir,"" he exclaimed, ""you ought to be in the intelligence office.""  ""God forbid!"" said Dr. Gurnet, piously. ""Not that I believe in God,"" he added; ""but I cling to the formulated expletives.  ""I should be extremely uncomfortable in any office. Besides, I have my doubts as to the value of intelligence in England. It is so very rare and so un-English. One suspects occasional un-English qualities drawn together for government purposes.  ""I merely mentioned these interesting national traits because I had an idea, partly that you would respond to them, and partly that they are going in an exceedingly short time to become manifest to the world at large.""  ""You think we are going to have war?"" asked Winn, his eyes sparkling. ""War!"" He said the word as if he loved it.  Dr. Gurnet shrugged his shoulders and sighed, and spread out his rather fat little hands.  ""Yes, Major Staines,"" he said dryly, ""I quite think we are going to have war.""  ""Then I must get back to my regiment as quickly as possible,"" said Winn, getting up.  ""I shouldn't do that if I were you,"" said Dr. Gurnet. ""I should advise your remaining in England for three months, I think you will be used quicker if you do that. War is unlikely to begin in India, and the climate is deleterious in the summer months. And might I suggest the carrying out of a few minor precautions? If you are to live efficiently for two years, it will be highly necessary for you to carry them out.""  Winn turned toward him eagerly.  ""I'll do any bally thing you tell me to now,"" he said quickly.  Dr. Gurnet laughed, then he said:  ""Go back to England, study German, and await your chance. Don't play any more heavy games, don't lose your temper or try your heart, don't drink or smoke or play billiards or sit in a room with a shut window. Take plenty of good plain food and a certain amount of exercise. You are going to be needed.""  Winn drew a deep breath.  ""It's a funny thing,"" he said, turning toward the door, ""but somehow I believe in you.""  Dr. Gurnet shook hands with him cordially.  ""In a sense, I may say,"" he observed, ""in spite of your extremely disappointing behavior, that I return the compliment. I believe in you, Major Staines, only--"" Dr. Gurnet finished the rest of the sentence after the door had shut behind his patient. ""Unfortunately, I am not sure if there are quite enough of you.""     CHAPTER XXIX   When the Staineses gave an entertainment it was to mark their contempt for what more sensitive people might have considered a family catastrophe.  They had given a ball a week from the day on which Dolores ran away with the groom. A boat-race had been inaugurated upon the occasion on which Winn lost his lawsuit; and some difficulty (ultimately overcome) between James and the Admiralty had resulted in a dinner followed by fireworks on the lawn.  When Winn returned from Davos, Lady Staines decided upon a garden party.  ""Good God!"" cried Sir Peter. ""Do you mean to tell me I've wasted that three hundred pounds, Sarah?"" Sir Peter preferred this form of the question to ""Is my boy going to die?"" He meant precisely the same thing.  ""As far as I know,"" Lady Staines replied, ""nobody ever dies _before_ causing trouble; they die after it, and add their funeral expenses to the other inconveniences they have previously arranged for. Can't you see the boy's marriage has gone to pot?""  ""I wish you wouldn't pick up slang expressions from your sons,"" growled Sir Peter. ""You never hear me speaking in that loose way. Why haven't they got a home of their own? You would ask them here--nurse, bottles, and baby like a traveling Barnum's--and Winn glares in one corner--and that little piece of dandelion fluff lies down and grizzles on the nearest cushion--and now you want to have a garden party on the top of 'em! Anybody'd suppose this was a Seamen's Home from the use you put it to! And of all damned silly ways of entertaining people, a garden party's the worse! Who wants to look at other people's gardens except to find fault with 'em?  ""Besides, unless you want rain (which we don't with the hay half down) it's tempting Providence. Nothing'll keep rain off a garden party except prayers in church during a drought.  ""What the hell do you expect to gain by it? I know what it all means--Buns! Bands! high-heeled kick-shaws cutting up my turf! Why the devil don't you get a Punch and Judy show down and be done with it?""  ""Of course you don't like a garden party,"" said Lady Staines, smoothly, ""nor do I. Do you suppose I care to be strapped tight into smart stays at my age, and walk about my own gravel paths in purple satin, listening to drivel about other people's children? We must do something for the neighborhood sometimes, whether they like it or not. That's what we're here for--it's the responsibility of our position. Quite absurd, I know, but then, most people's responsibilities are quite absurd. You have a son and he behaves like a fool. You can leave him to take the consequences of course if you like--only as some of them will devolve on us, it is worth a slight effort to evade them.""  ""For God's sake, spit it out, and have done with it!"" shouted Sir Peter. ""What's the boy done?""  Lady Staines sat down opposite her husband and folded her hands in her lap. She was a woman who always sat perfectly still on the rare occasions when she was not too busy to sit down at all.  ""What I hoped would happen,"" she said, ""hasn't happened. He's presumably picked up with some respectable woman.""  ""What do you mean by that?"" asked Sir Peter. ""I never knew any one as cold-bloodedly immoral as you are, Sarah. Did you want the boy to pick up with a baggage?""  ""Certainly,"" said Lady Staines. ""Why not? I have always understood that the Social Evil was for our protection, but I never believed it. No woman worth her salt has ever wanted protection. It's men that want it. They need a class of creature that won't involve them beyond a certain point, and quite right too. Winn seemed to see this before he went off--but he didn't keep it in mind--he ran his head into a noose.""  ""Has he talked to you about it?"" asked Sir Peter, incredulously.  ""I don't need talk,"" said Lady Staines. ""I judge by facts. Winn goes to church regularly, his temper is execrable, and he takes long walks by himself. A satisfied man is neither irate nor religious--and has nothing to walk off. Consequently it's a virtuous attachment. That's serious, because it will lead to the divorce court. Virtues generally lead to somebody trying to get out of something.""  ""Pooh!"" Sir Peter grunted. ""You've got that out of some damned French novel. You must have virtue, the place has got to be kept up somehow, hasn't it? If what you say is true--and I don't for a moment admit a word of it--I don't see how you're going to sugar things over with a couple of hundred people trampling up my lawn?""  ""Estelle likes people,"" Lady Staines replied. ""My idea is to make her a success. I will introduce her to everybody worth knowing. I'll get some of our people down from town. They'll hate it, of course; but they'll be curious to see what's up. Of course they won't see anything. At the end of the day, if it's all gone off well--I'll have a little talk with Estelle. I shall tell her first what I think of her; and then I shall offer to back her if she'll turn over a new leaf. Winn'll do his part for the sake of the boy, if she meets him half way. I give religion its due--he wants to do his duty, only he doesn't see what it is. He must live with his wife. His prayers will come in nicely afterwards.""  Sir Peter chuckled. ""There's something in your idea, Sarah,"" he admitted. ""But it's a damned expensive process. All my strawberries will go. And if it rains, everybody'll come into the house and scuttle over my library like so many rabbits.""  ""I'll keep them out of the library,"" said Lady Staines, rising, ""and I shall want a hundred pounds.""  She left the library after a short series of explosions, with a check for seventy-five. She had only expected fifty.  The garden party was, if not a great success, at least a great crowd.  The village was entertained by sports in a field, backed by beer in tents, and overseen by Winn with the delighted assistance of the younger Peter.  Lady Staines, in stiff purple satin, strode uncomfortably up and down herbaceous borders, exposing the ignorance of her fellow gardeners by a series of ruthless questions.  Charles and James, who had put in an intermittent appearance in the hope of a loan from Sir Peter, did their best to make things go. Charles had brought down a bull terrier, and the bull terrier brought down, first one of the donkeys that was to take part in the sports, but was permanently incapacitated from any further participation either in sport or labor, then two pet lap dogs, in a couple of sharp shakes on the lawn, and crowned his career of murder with the stable cat, in an outhouse where Charles had at last incontinently and a little inconsiderately, as far as the cat was concerned, flung him.  Isabel and her husband had driven over from a neighboring parish.  Isabel liked garden parties. She made her way at once to a group of clergy, her husband dangling meekly in her rear; and then told them in her quarter deck style exactly what she thought ought to be done with their parishes. Sir Peter remained in the library with the windows open and his eye upon passing clouds.  Several of his friends joined him, and they talked about Ulster.  Everybody was at this time talking about Ulster.  Most of them spoke of it as people talk of a tidal wave in China. They did not exactly wish the wave to destroy the whole of China, but they would all have felt a little annoyed if it had withdrawn without drowning anybody.  ""The Government has been weak,"" said Sir Peter sternly; ""as weak as a soft-boiled egg! What Ireland wants is a firm hand, and if that's not enough, a swift kick after it! Concession! Who wants concessions? A sensible man doesn't make concessions unless he's trying to bluff you into thinking he's got what he hasn't got, or is getting out of you what he hasn't right to get!  ""But people oughtn't to import arms. I'll go as far as that! It's against discipline. Whether it's one side or the other, it ought to be stopped.  ""There'll be a row, of course--a healthy, blood-letting hell of a row, and we shall all be the better for it! But I don't approve of firearms being let loose all over the place--it's un-English. It only shows what the poor devils at Ulster must have suffered, and be afraid of suffering, to resort to it! That sort of thing is all very well in the Balkans. My son Winn's been talking about the Balkans lately--kind of thing the army's always getting gas off about! What I say is--let 'em fight! They got the Turk down once, all of 'em together, and he was the only person that could keep 'em in hand. Now I hear Austria wants to start trouble in Serbia because of that assassination in June. What they want to make a fuss about assassination in that family for I can't think! I should look upon it as an hereditary disease and leave it at that! But don't tell me it's anything to worry about compared to Ulster. What's the danger of a country that talks thirteen languages, has no non-commissioned officers, and always gets beat when it fights? Sarah! Sarah! Get the people in for tea. Can't you see there's a shower coming? Damn it all! And my second crop of hay's not in yet! That's what comes of giving garden parties. Of course I'm very glad to see you all, but you know what I mean. No shilly-shallying with the English climate's my motto--it's the only dangerous thing we've got!""  Lady Staines disregarded this admonition. The light clouds above the elms puffed idly in the heavy air. It was a hot bright day, murmurous with bees and the idle, half notes of midsummer birds.  Estelle, in the most diaphanous of blue muslins, held a little court under a gigantic mulberry tree. She had always intended marriage with a Staines to be like this.  Winn was nowhere to be seen, and his mother plodded patiently to and fro across the lawn, bringing a line of distinguished visitors to be introduced to her.  They were kind, curt people who looked at Estelle rather hard, and asked her absurd questions about Winn's regiment, Sir Peter's ships, and her baby. They had no general ideas, but however difficult they were to talk to, Estelle knew they were the right people to meet--she had seen their names in magazines. None of her own family were there; they had all been invited, but Estelle had preferred their remaining at home. She had once heard Sir Peter refer to her father as ""Old Moneybags."" He had apologized afterwards, but he might do it again.  Lady Staines was the only person who noticed the arrival of two telegrams--they were taken to Charles and James, who were at that moment in the refreshment tent opposite the claret cup. The telegrams arrived simultaneously, and Charles said, ""Good Lord!"" and James said, ""My hat!"" when they read the contents, with every symptom of surprise and pleasure.  ""I shouldn't have supposed,"" Lady Staines thought to herself, ""that two of my boys would have backed the same horse. It must be a coincidence.""  They put the telegrams rather carefully away, and shortly afterwards she observed that they had set off together in the direction of the village sports.  The long golden twilight drew to a close, the swallows swooped and circled above the heavy, darkened elms. The flowers in the long herbaceous borders had a fragile look in the colorless soft air.  The garden party drifted slowly away.  Lady Staines stopped her daughter-in-law going into the house; but she was destined never to tell her what she thought of her. Estelle escaped Nemesis by the turn of a hair.  Sir Peter came out of the library prepared to inspect the lawn. ""What's up with those boys?"" he demanded, struck by the unusual sight of his three sons advancing towards him from the river, their heads bent in talk, and not apparently quarreling.  Lady Staines followed the direction of his eyes; then she said to Estelle, ""You'd better go in now, my dear; I'll talk to you later.""  Sir Peter shouted in his stentorian voice an appeal to his sons to join him. Lady Staines, while she waited, took off her white kid gloves and her purple bonnet, and deposited them upon the balustrades.  ""What are you up to,"" demanded Sir Peter when they came within earshot, ""sticking down there by the river with your heads glued together like a set of damned Guy Fawkeses--instead of saying good-by to your mother's guests--who haven't had the sense to get under way before seven o'clock--though I gave 'em a hint to be off an hour ago?""  ""Helping villagers to climb greasy poles, and finishing a sack race,"" Charles explained. ""Lively time Winn's been having down there--I had no idea our second housemaid was so pretty.""  ""None of that! None of that!"" said Sir Peter, sharply. ""You keep to bar-maids, young Charles--and manicure girls, though there ought to be an act of Parliament against 'em! Still, I'll admit you can't do much harm here--three of you together, and your mother on the front doorstep!""  ""Harm,"" said James, winking in the direction of his mother; ""what can poor chaps like us do--here to-day and gone to-morrow--Mother'd better keep her eye on those near home!""  ""Off to-night you might as well say!"" remarked Charles, glancing at James with a certain intentness.  ""Why off to-night?"" asked Lady Staines. ""I thought you were staying over the week-end?""  ""Winn's put us on to something,"" explained Charles. ""Awfully good show, he says--on at the Oxford. Pretty hot stuff and the censor hasn't smelt it out yet--we rather thought we'd run up to-night and have a look at it.""  Winn stuck his hands in his pockets, set his jaw, and looked at his mother. Lady Staines was regarding him with steady eyes.  ""You didn't get a telegram, too?"" she asked.  ""No,"" said Winn. ""Why should I?""  ""Not likely,"" said James, genially. ""Always behindhand in the--""  ""Damn these midges!"" said Charles, hurriedly. James stopped with his mouth open.  ""Army, you were going to say, weren't you?"" asked his mother, suavely. ""If you are my sons I must say you make uncommonly poor liars.""  Sir Peter, whose attention had wandered to tender places in the lawn, looked up sharply.  ""What's that? What's that?"" he asked. ""Been telling lies, have they? A nice way you've brought 'em up, Sarah! What have they been lying about? A woman? Because if they have, I won't hear a word about it! Lies about a woman are perfectly correct, though I'm hanged if I can see how they can all three be lying about one woman. That seems a bit thick, I must say.""  To Sir Peter's surprise, nobody made any reply. Charles yawned, James whistled, and Winn kept his eyes steadily fixed on Lady Staines.  ""Those were orders then,"" Lady Staines observed in a dry quiet voice. ""I thought it very likely. I suppose it's Germany. I felt sure we should have trouble with that excitable young man sooner or later. He had too good an opinion of himself to be an emperor.""  ""Not Ulster!"" exclaimed Sir Peter. ""God bless my soul--not Ulster!""  ""Oh, we can take on Ulster afterwards,"" said James reassuringly. ""Now we'll see what submarines can do; 'member the Japs?""  ""Winn,"" said Lady Staines, ""before you're off, say good-by to your wife.""  Winn frowned, and then he said, ""All right, Mother,"" and left them.  It was a very still evening, the scent of new mown hay and the mysterious sweetness of the starry white tobacco plant haunted the delicate air.  Winn found Estelle lying down by the open window. He had not been in her room for some time. He sat down by the sofa, and fingered the tassels at her waist.  ""Is anything the matter?"" she asked coldly.  He had only himself to thank that she was cold--he knew that. He saw so plainly now, all the mistakes he'd made, that the ones Estelle had made, receded into the distance. He'd never been gentle to her. Even when he thought he loved her, he wasn't really gentle.  Gentleness was superlative kindness, and no woman who had not had just that sort of kindness from the man she married, could help being rather nasty. He had owed it to Estelle--no matter whether she told him the truth or not.  ""Look here, Estelle,"" he began. ""I want our boy to go to Charterhouse.""  It wasn't exactly what he meant to say, but it was something; he had never called Peter ""our boy"" before. Estelle did not notice it.  ""Of course, I should prefer Eton,"" she said, ""but I suppose you will do as you like--as usual!""  Winn dropped the piece of tassel, but he persevered.  ""I say,"" he began, ""don't you think we've got rather off the track? I know it's not your fault, but your being ill and my being away and all that? I don't want you to feel sore about it, you know. I want you to realize that I know I've been rather a beast to you. I don't think I'm fitted somehow for domestic life--what?""  ""Fitted for it!"" said Estelle, tragically. ""I have never known one happy moment with you! You seem incapable of any kind of chivalry! I never would have believed a man could exist who knew _less_ how to make a woman happy! It's too late to talk of it all now! I've made my supreme sacrifice. I've offered up my broken heart! I am living upon a higher plane! You would never understand anything that wasn't coarse, brutal, and low! So I shan't explain it to you. I know my duty, but I don't think after the way you have behaved I really need consider myself under any obligation to live with you again. Father Anselm agrees with me.""  Winn laughed. ""Don't you worry about that,"" he hastened to assure her, ""or Father Anselm either; there isn't the least necessity--and it wasn't what I meant.""  Estelle looked annoyed. It plainly should have been what Winn meant.  ""Have as much of the higher plane as you like,"" he went on, ""only look after the boy. I'm off to London to-night, there's probably going to be some work of a kind that I can do. I mayn't be back directly. Hope you'll be all right. We can write about plans.""  He stood up, hesitating a little. He had an idea that it would make him feel less strange if she kissed him. Of course it was absurd, because just to have a woman's arms round his neck wasn't going to be the least like Claire. But he had a curious feeling that perhaps he might never be alone with a woman again, and he wanted to part friends with Estelle.  ""I wonder,"" he said, leaning towards her, ""would you mind very much if I kissed you?""  Estelle turned her head away with a little gesture of aversion.  ""I am sorry,"" she said. ""I shall not willingly allow you to kiss me, but of course you are my husband--I am in your power.""  ""By Jove,"" said Winn, unexpectedly, ""what a little cat you are!""  They were the last words he ever said to her.     CHAPTER XXX   For a time he could do nothing but think of his luck--it was astounding how obstacles had been swept aside for him.  The best he had expected was that in the hurry of things he might get back to India without a medical examination, in the hope that his regiment would be used later. But his work at the Staff College had brought him into notice, a man conveniently died, and Winn appeared at the right moment.  Within twenty-four hours of his visit to the War Office, he was attached for staff duty to a British division.  Then work closed over his head. He became a railway time-table, a lost-luggage office, a registrar, and a store commissioner.  He had the duties of a special Providence thrust upon him, with all the disadvantages of being readily held accountable, so skilfully evaded by the higher powers.  Junior officers flew to him for orders as belated ladies fly to their pin cushions for pins.  He ate when it was distinctly necessary, and slept two hours out of the twenty-four.  He left nothing undone which he could do himself; his mind was unfavorable to chance. The heads of departments listened when he made suggestions, and found it convenient to answer with accuracy his sudden questions.  Subordinates hurried to obey his infrequent but final orders; and when Winn said, ""I think you'd find it better,"" people found it better.  The division slipped off like cream, without impediment or hitch.  There were no delays, the men acquired their kit, and found their railway carriages.  The trains swept in velvet softness out of the darkened London station through the sweet, quiet, summer night into a sleepless Folkestone. The division went straight onto the right transports; there wasn't a man, a horse, or a gun out of place.  Winn heaved a sigh of relief as he stepped on board; his troubles as a staff officer had only just begun, but they had begun as troubles should always begin, by being adequately met. There were no arrears.  He did not think of Claire until he stood on deck and saw the lights receding and the shadow that was England passing out of his sight.  He remembered her then with a little pang of joy--for suddenly he knew that he was free to think of her.  He had thought of her before as a man registers a fact that is always present to him, but in the interval since he had seen her his consciousness of her had been increasingly troubled.  Now the trouble was fading, as England faded, as his old life was fading.  He had a sense that he was finally freed. It was not like seeing Claire again, but it was like not having to see anything else.  ""Until I'm dead I'm hers, and after I'm dead I'm hers, so that's all right,"" he said to himself. ""I haven't got to muddle things up any more.""  The sea lay around them at dawn like a sheet of pearl--it was very empty but for the gulls' wings beating to and fro out of the mist.  Winn had lived through many campaigns. He had known rough jungle tussles in mud swamps, maddened by insects, thirst, and fever; he had fought in colder, cleaner dangers down the Khyber Pass, and he had gone through the episodic scientific flurries of South Africa; but France disconcerted him; he had never started a campaign before in a country like a garden, met by welcoming populations, with flowers and fruit.  It made him feel sick. The other places were the proper ones for war.  It was not his way to think of what lay before him. It would, like all great emergencies, like all great calamities, keep to its moment, and settle itself. Nevertheless he could not free his mind from the presence of the villages--the pleasant, smiling villages, the little church towers in the middle, the cobbled streets, the steep-pitched, gray roofs and the white sunny walls.  Carnations and geraniums filled the windows, and all the inhabitants, the solid, bright-faced people, had a greeting for their khaki guests.  ""Voila quelque choses des solides, ces Anglais!"" the women called to each other.  Winn found himself shrinking from their welcoming eyes. He thought he hadn't had enough sleep, because as a rule a Staines did not shrink; but when he slept in the corner of the hot jolting railway train, he dreamed of the villages.  They were to attack directly they arrived at their destination. By the time they reached there, Winn knew more. He had gathered up the hastily flung messages by telegram and telephone, by flying cars and from breathless despatch riders, and he knew what they meant.  They had no chance, from the first, not a ghost of a chance. They were to hold on as long as they could, and then retreat. Part of the line had gone already. The French had gone. No reinforcements were coming up. There were no reinforcements.  They were to retreat turn and turn about; meantime they must hold.  They could hear the guns now, the bright harvest fields trembled a little under the impact of these alien presences.  They came nearer and the sky filled with white puffs of smoke that looked like glittering sunset clouds, and were not clouds. Overhead the birds sang incessantly, undisturbed even by the occasional drilling of an aeroplane.  In the plains that lay beneath them, they could see the dim blue lines of the enemy debouching.  They made Winn think of locusts. He had seen a plague once in Egypt. They came on like the Germans, a gray mass that never broke--that could not break, because behind it there were more, and still more locusts, thick as clouds, impenetrable as clouds.  You killed and killed and killed, and yet there were more clouds.  Every now and then it ran through his mind like a flame, that they would spread this loathsome, defiling cloud over the smiling little villages of France.  Fortunately there was no time for pity; there were merely the different ways of meeting the question of holding on.  It was like an attempt to keep back a tide with a teaspoon.  Their guns did what they could, they did more than it seemed possible guns could do. The men in control of them worked like maniacs.  It was not a time to think of what people could do. The men were falling like leaves off a tree.  The skylarks and the swallows vanished before the villainous occupation of the air. The infantry in the loosely built trenches held on, breathless, broken, like a battered boat in a hurricane, stout against the oncoming waves.  The stars came out and night fell--night rent and tortured, darkness assaulted and broken by a myriad new lights of death, but still merciful, reassuring darkness. The moment for the retreat had come.  It was a never-ending business, a stumbling, bewildering business. The guns roared on, holding open indefatigably, without cessation, the way of their escape.  Much later they got away themselves, dashing blindly in the wake of their exhausted little army, ready to turn at command and hold again, and escape again, and once more hold the unending blue lines, with their unnumbered guns, unwinding like an endless serpent in their rear.  The morning showed them still retreating. Sometimes they were miles ahead and could see nothing but the strangely different barred and shivering villages, small settlements of terror, in an untroubled land.  There were no flowers flung upon them now, only hurried gasping questions, ""Are they coming?"" ""How far are they behind you?""  Sometimes they were halted for half an hour at a time, and sat in hedges and ate, or meant to eat, and slept between the bites.  Occasionally they surprised small bands of wandering Uhlans, and if there was time took them prisoners, and if there was no time, shot them in rows against white walls.  Once they met a troop out of one of their own divisions, led by a solitary subaltern of nineteen, with queer fixed eyes, who didn't know who he was. All he could say, ""I brought them out.""  Despatch riders hurled themselves upon the Staff with orders; very often they had conflicting orders; and they always had dust, trouble with horses, trouble with motor ambulances, trouble with transport. Enraged heroic surgeons achieving hourly physical miracles, implored with tears to be given impossible things like time. Of course they couldn't have time.  Then in the midst of chaos, orders would come to hold. The guns unlimbered, the transports tore madly ahead. Everything that could be cleared off down the road was cleared off, more rough trenches were dug, more hot and sullen hours of waiting followed, and then once more the noise, the helpless slaughter, the steady dogged line gripping the shallow earth, and the unnumbered horde of locusts came on again, eating up the fields of France.  Sometimes whole regiments entrained under the care of fatherly French railway officials, curiously liable to hysteria on ordinary excursion days, but now as calm as Egyptian Pyramids in the face of national disaster. They pieced together with marvelous ingenuity the broken thread of speech presented to them by the occasional French scholars upon the British Staff; but more often still they shook polite and emphatic heads, and explained that there quite simply were no trains. The possible, yes; but the impossible, no. One could not create trains. So the men went on marching. They did not like retreating, but they moved as if they were on parade in front of Buckingham Palace, and when they held, they fought as winners fight.  It was not until they reached the Marne that Winn found time to write to Claire. ""We are getting on very nicely,"" he wrote. ""I hope you are not worrying about us. We have plenty to eat, though we have to take our meals a little hurriedly.  ""There is a good deal of work to do.  ""This war is the best thing that ever happened to me--bar one. Before I came out I thought I should go to pieces. I feel quite free to write to you now. I do not think there can be any harm in it, so I hope you won't mind. If things do not seem to be going very well with us at first, remember that they never do.  ""Every campaign I ever went in for, we were short-handed to start with, and had to fight against odds, which doesn't matter really if you have the right men, but always takes longer and looks discouraging to outsiders. The men are very good and I am glad the War Office let me commandeer the boots I wanted--the kind they offered me at first wouldn't have done at all for this sort of work. It is rather hard not being with the men more, but the work is very absorbing, so I do not mind as much as I did.  ""I think the regiment will come out later, and they have promised to let me go back into it. I am sorry about the villages. It's a pity the Germans slopped over into France at all. I found two Uhlans yesterday in a farmyard; they had been behaving badly, so I did them both in.  ""One very seldom sees any of them, worse luck.  ""I hope you are taking great care of yourself and not worrying. Your loving Winn.""  In the weeks that followed, Claire got many letters. They were short letters, written in flying motors, in trains, in outhouses, in romantic chateaux; but they all began in the same reassuring way. ""I am very well, and we are getting on quite nicely.""  The Allied line was being flung out in wild curves and swoops like the flight of a dove before a hawk; from Soissons up toward Calais they fenced and circled.  They retook Rheims, they seized Amiens. Lille fell from them and Laon.  The battle of the Aisne passed by slow degrees out of their hands, and the English found themselves fighting their extraordinary first fight for Ypres. They stood between the Germans and the Channel ports as thinly as a Japanese screen, between England and the Atlantic. The very camp cooks were in the trenches.  Time fled like a long thunderous hour. It was a storm that flashed and fell and returned again.  Winn was beginning to feel tired now. He hardly slept at night, and by day his brain moved as if it were made of red-hot steel, flying rapidly from expedient to expedient, facing the hourly problems of that wild and wet October, how to keep men alive who never rested, who were too few, who took the place of guns. He wrote more seldom now, and once he said, ""We are having rather a hard time, but we shall get through with it.""  Fortunately all Englishmen are born with a curious pioneer instinct, and being the least adaptable people in the world, they have learned the more readily to adapt the changes of the hour.  They remade their external world, out of this new warfare.  They remade it at the cost of their lives in Flanders, in the face of incredulous enemies and criticizing neutrals, painstakingly, without science, doggedly out of their own wills. They held Ypres by a thread, and when it seemed that nothing could keep it, one cold and dreadful day along the Menin road came up their reinforcements.  First one group and then another of tall, dark people, silent footed as falling leaves, turbaned black faces, eyes of appalling and unearthly gravity, hearts half like a rock and half like a child, alien captive people of another blood, took their place silently, regiment by regiment blocking up the dreadful gaps with their guns, their rifles, and the free gift of their lives.  ""Lionel has come,"" Winn wrote, ""and all my men. I never was so glad of anything, but you. Send me all the warm things you can. The winter will be quite jolly now when the men get used to the trenches. It's a funny thing, but they've given me command of the regiment. I hadn't expected it, but I've always liked handling Sikhs. Whatever happens, you'll remember that I've been an awfully lucky chap, won't you?""     CHAPTER XXXI   Lionel and Winn talked of the regiment and the war; these two things filled the exacting hours. In a world a very long way off and in the depths of their hearts were England and Claire.  They spent three weeks in the trenches, blackened and water clogged and weary.  It was the darkest time of a dark December, the water was up to their waists, there was no draining the treacherous clay surfaces. The men suffered to the limit of their vitality and sometimes passed it; they needed constant care and watching. It had to be explained to them that they were not required to give up their lives to spirits, in a land that worshiped idols. Behind the strange lights and noises heralding death there were solid people who ate sausages, and could be killed.  One or two small parties led in night attacks overcame the worst of their fears.  Later on when the mud dried they could kill more; in the end all would be killed, and they would return with much honor to their land of sunshine.  To the officers who moved among them, absorbed in the questions of their care, there was never any silence or peace, and yet there was a strange content in the huddled, altered life of their wet ditch.  Every power of the will, every nerve of the body, was being definitely used. Winn and Lionel felt a strange mood of exultation. They pushed back difficulties and pierced insoluble problems with prompt escapes. Only from time to time casualties dropped in upon them grimly, impervious to human ingenuity.  In the quieter hours of the night, they crouched side by side formulating fresh schemes and going over one by one the weak points of their defenses.  They hadn't enough guns, or any reinforcements; they had no dry clothes. The men were not accustomed to wet climates or invisible enemies.  They wanted more sand-bags and more bombs, and it would be better for human beings not to be in trenches for three weeks at a time in the rain.  They sat there pitting their brains against these obstacles, creating the miraculous ingenuity of war. Personal questions dropped. Lionel saw that Winn was ill beyond mending, but he saw it without definite thought--it was one more obstacle in a race of obstacles. It wouldn't do for Winn to break down. He fitted himself without explanations, selflessly, with magnificent disinterestedness, into his friend's needs. He was like a staff in the hand of a blind man.  Winn himself had begun to wonder, moving about in his sea of mud, how much worse you could be before you were actually done. His cough shook him incessantly, his brain burned, and his hands were curiously weak. He was conscious that he had to repeat to himself all day long the things he had to do; even then he might have forgotten if there had not been Lionel. He might have forgotten to give orders. In spite of everything a strange inner bliss possessed him which nourished him like food. He had Claire's letters, they never failed him, they were as regular as the beats of a heart. Something in him lived that had never lived before, something that did not seem likely ever to die.  It was helping him as Lionel was helping him to get through things. What he had to get through was dying. It was going to be quicker than the way they had of dying in Davos, but it mightn't be quick enough; it might drive him out of his last fight, back to an inconceivable stale world.  This must not happen. Lionel must live and he must die, where he was. You could bully fate, if you were prepared to pay the price for it.  Winn was not sure yet what the price would be, he was only sure that he was prepared to pay it.  They were to be relieved next day. The men were so worn out that they could hardly move. Winn and Lionel found their own bodies difficult to control; they had become heavy and inert from want of sleep, but their minds were alive and worked with feverish swiftness, like the minds of people in a long illness, when consciousness creeps above the level of pain.  Winn had just returned from his evening round of the trenches. Lionel was resting in his dug-out; he heard Winn's approach. Winn was coughing again--a little choking, short cough.  He bent double and crouched down beside Lionel without speaking.  ""Well,"" said Lionel, ""to-morrow we'll be out of this. About time too--with that cough of yours.""  Winn was silent for a moment, then he said, ""I suppose you know I'm nearly done?""  Lionel bowed his head. ""Yes,"" he muttered, ""I suppose I know it.""  After a pause Winn began again.  ""There isn't much good talking, of course. On the other hand, you may as well know what I feel. I've had tremendous luck in one way and another. I never expected to get the regiment, for instance--and your coming out here and all that. I've seen how jolly things could be.""  ""You haven't had them,"" said Lionel in a low voice. ""The things you wanted most, I mean. Your pitch was queered too soon.""  ""I don't know,"" said Winn, painstakingly. ""In a sense, of course, you haven't had things if you've only seen 'em. Still when you come to think of it, you partly have. Look at the Germans; we've worked considerably into them without seeing 'em, haven't we? What I mean is that I appreciate goodness now; I see its point. Not that I'd have kept clear a moment by myself. I hope you quite understand that? I've been a blackguard and I'd have been a worse one if I'd had the chance. But I'm glad I hadn't the chance now. I don't know that I'm putting the thing straight--but you know what she's like? Thank God I couldn't alter her!""  They listened for a moment to the night. Their ears were always awake, registering sounds from the sodden, death-ridden fields beneath them, and above, but they heard nothing beyond the drip of the rain, an occasional groan from a man tortured by rheumatism, and the long-drawn scream of a distant shell.  ""You can call yourself what you like,"" said Lionel at last. ""I know what you are, that's enough for me, and she knew it; that's one reason I got to caring for her.  ""I dare say that seems a rummy thing to you, to care for a woman because she cares for another man. But it's a fact.""  Winn moved uneasily. Then he said abruptly, ""Look here, young 'un, I was wrong before when I asked you to step in instead of me, but I'm not wrong now. You can take it from me she'll marry you in the end. She's young; be patient. I dare say she'll think for a time she's had enough, but she hasn't. There's no good living a lonely life. We may both get done in, of course. But I don't fancy we shall. I want you to promise me not to get killed if you can help it.  ""Keep away from me if you think I'm getting into trouble, because I sha'n't be getting into trouble, I shall be getting out of it, d'you see?""  The guns sounded nearer, a machine gun rattled sharply in their ears, as if it had been let off in their dug-out.  ""I sha'n't care for anybody else,"" said Lionel, quietly, ""and I shall wait all my life for her. As for not being killed--you don't want me to shirk my job, of course; bar that, I sha'n't ask for trouble.""  Winn said, ""All right--then that's that! I'm going to sleep.""  They neither of them slept.  It came very quickly and confusedly toward dawn. The silence was rent across like a piece of torn silk. The crash of bombs, the peppery, sharp detonation of rifles broke up the sullen air. Out of the dark, vague shapes loomed, the trench filled with the sound of deep breathing and scuffling, and the shriek of sudden pain.  Death and mud and darkness closed together.  It was all over in half an hour, the attack was driven out, and the men moved uncertainly about, trying to discover their dead, and relieve their wounded.  The dawn was gray and in the half light, Winn saw Lionel's eyes open and shut; the blood was pouring from a hideous wound in his side.  ""You've got to live,"" Winn said grimly, bending over him. ""No damned nonsense about it! You've got to live."" Lionel's eyes closed again and he knew nothing more of the rough bandaging, the endless waiting in the sodden trench while Winn sat motionless beside him, watching his flickering breath. In the hours of the interminable journey, Lionel roused himself sometimes and heard again like a perpetual refrain, ""You've got to live."" The motor ambulance jarred and bumped it, the wheels of the train echoed it through the fever in his brain. He woke in England knowing that he was going to live.  [Illustration: ""You've got to live,"" said Winn, bending grimly over him; ""You've got to live!""]  A few hours later Winn went to see the general of his division. ""I want you to let me have another twenty-four in, sir,"" he explained. ""They won't expect an attack so soon. I know my men are not very fresh, but it'll wake them up. They've stood a good lot. I've been talking to 'em. They want to get a bit of their own back. That trench of theirs is too near us in any case. They'd be better pushed back.""  The general hesitated, but Winn's fiery sunken eyes held and shook him.  ""Well, Staines,"" he said, ""you know what you can do with your men, of course. Have it your own way. When do you want to attack?""  ""Soon as they've settled off to sleep,"" said Winn, ""just to give 'em a night-cap.""  ""Don't lose too many men,"" said the general, ""and above all come back yourself.""  ""That's as may be,"" said Winn. ""If I can get the men over quietly in a bit of mist, I sha'n't lose too many of 'em. I've told them if they're too fagged to stand, they'd better fight. They quite agree about it.""  Winn led the attack with the last of his strength, and in the fierceness of his rage with life.  A white fog hung over the fields like the shadow of a valley filled with snow.  The men fought like demons--strange shapes in the fog, with here and there as the flames shot up, the flash of their black faces, set to kill.  Winn's voice rallied and held them above the racket of the spitting rifles, and the incessant coughing of the guns. It was the Staines voice let out on a last voyage. To have gone back against it would have been more dangerous than to go on against the guns.  They seized the trench and held it, there were no prisoners taken in the dark, and after the first light they ceased to hear Winn's voice.  The sun came out and showed them all they had won, and what they had lost.  Winn lay peacefully between the old trench and the new, beyond resentment, beyond confusion, in the direct simplicity of death.

"5",30014,"Native Son","T. D. Hamm","[Illustration]                   NATIVE SON                     _By                 T. D. Hamm_        Tommy hated Earth, knowing his mother  might go home to Mars without him. Worse,  would a robot secretly take her place?...   Tommy Benton, on his first visit to Earth, found the long-anticipated wonders of twenty-first-century New York thrilling the first week, boring and unhappy the second week, and at the end of the third he was definitely ready to go home.  The never-ending racket of traffic was torture to his abnormally acute ears. Increased atmospheric pressure did funny things to his chest and stomach. And quick and sure-footed on Mars, he struggled constantly against the heavy gravity that made all his movements clumsy and uncoordinated.  The endless canyons of towering buildings, with their connecting Skywalks, oppressed and smothered him. Remembering the endless vistas of _rabbara_ fields beside a canal that was like an inland sea, homesickness flooded over him.  He hated the people who stared at him with either open or hidden amusement. His Aunt Bee, for instance, who looked him up and down with frank disapproval and said loudly, ""For Heavens sake, Helen! Take him to a _good_ tailor and get those bones covered up!""  Was it his fault he was six inches taller than Terran boys his age, and had long, thin arms and legs? Or that his chest was abnormally developed to compensate for an oxygen-thin atmosphere? I'd like to see _her_, he thought fiercely, out on the Flatlands; she'd be gasping like a canal-fish out of water.  Even his parents, happily riding the social merry-go-round of Terra, after eleven years in the Martian flatlands, didn't seem to understand how he felt.  ""Don't you _like_ Earth, Tommy?"" queried his mother anxiously.  ""Oh ... it's all right, I guess.""  ""... 'A nice place to visit' ..."" said his father sardonically.  ""... 'but I wouldn't live here if they gave me the place!' ..."" said his mother, and they both burst out laughing for no reason that Tommy could see. Of course, they did that lots of times at home and Tommy laughed with them just for the warm, secure feeling of belonging. This time he didn't feel like laughing.  ""When _are_ we going home?"" he repeated stubbornly.  His father pulled Tommy over in the crook of his arm and said gently, ""Well, not right away, son. As a matter of fact, how would you like to stay here and go to school?""  Tommy pulled away and looked at him incredulously.  ""I've _been_ to school!""  ""Well, yes,"" admitted his father. ""But only to the colony schools. You don't want to grow up and be an ignorant Martian sandfoot all your life, do you?""  ""Yes, I do! I _want_ to be a Martian sandfoot. And I want to go home where people don't _look_ at me and say, 'So this is your little Martian!'""  Benton, Sr., put his arm around Tommy's stiffly resistant shoulders. ""Look here, old man,"" he said persuasively. ""I thought you wanted to be a space engineer. You can't do that without an education you know. And your Aunt Bee will take good care of you.""  Tommy faced him stubbornly. ""I don't want to be any old spaceman. I want to be a sandfoot like old Pete. And I want to go home.""  Helen bit back a smile at the two earnest, stubborn faces so ridiculously alike, and hastened to avert the gathering storm.  ""Now look, fellows. Tommy's career doesn't have to be decided in the next five minutes ... after all, he's only ten. He can make up his mind later on if he wants to be an engineer or a _rabbara_ farmer. Right now, he's going to stay here and go to school ... _and_ I'm staying with him.""  Resolutely avoiding both crestfallen faces, Helen, having shepherded Tommy to bed, returned to the living room acutely conscious of Big Tom's bleak, hurt gaze at her back.  ""Helen, you're going to make a sissy out of the boy,"" he said at last. ""There isn't any reason why he can't stay here at home with Bee.""  Helen turned to face him.  ""Earth _isn't_ home to Tommy. And your sister Bee told him he ought to be out playing football with the boys instead of hanging around the house.""  ""But she knows the doctor said he'd have to take it easy for a year till he was accustomed to the change in gravity and air-pressure,"" he answered incredulously.  ""Exactly. She also asked me,"" Helen went on grimly, ""if I thought he'd be less of a freak as he got older.""  Tom Benton swore. ""Bee always did have less sense than the average hen,"" he gritted. ""My son a freak! Hell's-bells!""  Tommy, arriving at the hall door in time to hear the tail-end of the sentence, crept back to bed feeling numb and dazed. So even his father thought he was a freak.         *       *       *       *       *  The last few days before parting was one of strain for all of them. If Tommy was unnaturally subdued, no one noticed it; his parents were not feeling any great impulse toward gaiety either.  They all went dutifully sight-seeing as before; they saw the Zoo, and went shopping on the Skywalks, and on the last day wound up at the great showrooms of ""Androids, Inc.""  Tommy had hated them on sight; they were at once too human and too inhuman for comfort. The hotel was full of them, and most private homes had at least one. Now they saw the great incubating vats, and the processing and finally the showroom where one of the finished products was on display as a maid, sweeping and dusting.  ""There's one that's a dead-ringer for you, Helen. If you were a little better looking, that is."" Tommy's dad pretended to compare them judicially. Helen laughed, but Tommy looked at him with a resentfulness. Comparing his mother to an Android....  ""They say for a little extra you can get an exact resemblance. Maybe I'd better have one fixed up like you to take back with me,"" Big Tom added teasingly. Then as Helen's face clouded over, ""Oh, hon, you know I was only kidding. Let's get out of here; this place gives me the collywobbles. Besides, I've got to pick up my watch.""  But his mother's face was still unhappy and Tommy glowered sullenly at his father's back all the way to the watch-shop.  It was a small shop, with an inconspicuous sign down in one corner of the window that said only, ""KRUMBEIN--watches,"" and was probably the most famous shop of its kind in the world. Every spaceman landing on Terra left his watch to be checked by the dusty, little old man who was the genius of the place. Tommy ranged wide-eyed about the clock and chronometer crammed interior. He stopped fascinated before the last case. In it was a watch ... but, _what_ a watch! Besides the regulation Terran dial, it had a second smaller dial that registered the corresponding time on Mars. Tommy's whole heart went out to it in an ecstasy of longing. He thought wistfully that if you could know what time it was there, you could imagine what everyone was doing and it wouldn't seem so far away. Haltingly, he tried to explain.  ""Look, Mom,"" he said breathlessly. ""It's almost five o'clock at home. Douwie will be coming up to the barn to be fed. Gosh, do you suppose old Pete will remember about her?""  His mother smiled at him reassuringly. ""Of course he will, silly. Don't forget he was the one who caught and tamed her for you.""  Tommy gulped as he thought of Douwie. Scarcely as tall as himself; the big, rounded, mouselike ears, and the flat, cloven pads that could carry her so swiftly over the sandy Martian flatlands. One of the last dwindling herds of native Martian douwies, burden-carriers of a vanished race, she had been Tommy's particular pride and joy for the last three years.  Behind him, Tommy heard his mother murmur under her breath, ""Tom ... the watch; _could_ we?""  And his Dad regretfully, ""It's a pretty expensive toy for a youngster, Helen. And even a _rabbara_ raiser's bank account has limits.""  ""Of course, dear; it was silly of me."" Helen smiled a little ruefully. ""And if Mr. Krumbein has your watch ready, we _must_ go. Bee and some of her friends are coming over, and it's only a few hours 'till you ... leave.""  Big Tom squeezed her elbow gently, understandingly, as she blinked back quick tears. Trailing after them, Tommy saw the little by-play and his heart ached. The guilt-complex building up in him grew and deepened.  He knew he had only to say, ""Look, I don't mind staying. Aunt Bee and I will get along swell,"" and everything would be all right again. Then the terror of this new and complex world--as it would be without a familiar face--swept over him and kept him silent.  His overwrought feelings expressed themselves in a nervously rebelling stomach, culminating in a disgraceful moment over the nearest gutter. The rest of the afternoon he spent in bed recuperating.  In the living room Aunt Bee spoke her mind in her usual, high-pitched voice.  ""It's disgraceful, Helen. A boy his age.... None of the _Bentons_ ever had nerves.""  His mother's reply was inaudible, but on the heels of his father's deeper tones, Aunt Bee's voice rose in rasping indignation.  ""_Well!_ I never! And from my own brother, too. From now on don't come to me for help with your spoiled brat. Good-_bye_!""  The door slammed indignantly, his mother chuckled, and there was a spontaneous burst of laughter. Tommy relaxed and lay back happily. Anyway, that was the last of Aunt Bee!         *       *       *       *       *  The next hour or two passed in a flurry of ringing phones, people coming and going, and last-minute words and reminders. Then suddenly it was time to leave. Dad burst in for a last quick hug and a promise to send him pictures of Douwie and her foal, due next month; Mother dropped a hasty kiss on his hair and promised to hurry back from the Spaceport. Then Tommy was alone, with a large, painful lump where his heart ought to be.  The only activity was the almost noiseless buzzing as the hotel android ran the cleaner over the living room. Presently even that ceased, and Tommy lay relaxed and inert, sleepily watching the curtains blow in and out at the open window. Thirty stories above the street the noises were pleasantly muffled and remote, and his senses drifted aimlessly to and fro on the tides of half-sleep.  Drowsily his mind wandered from the hotel's android servants ... to the strictly utilitarian mechanical monstrosity at home, known affectionately as ""Old John"" ... to the android showroom where they had seen the one that Dad said looked like Mother....  He jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered treacherously, suppose that Dad _had_ ordered one to take Mom's place ... not on Mars, but _here_ while she returned to Mars with him. Suppose that instead of Mom he discovered one of those _Things_ ... or even worse, suppose he went on from day to day not even knowing....  It was a bad five minutes; he was wet with perspiration when he lay back on his pillows, a shaky smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He had a secret defense against the Terror. He giggled a little at the thought of what Aunt Bee would say if she knew.  And what had brought him back from the edge of hysteria was the triumphant knowledge that with the abnormally acute hearing bred in the thin atmosphere of Mars, no robot ever created could hide from him the infinitesimal ticking of the electronic relays that gave it life. Secure at last, his overstrung nerves relaxed and he slid gratefully over the edge of sleep.  He woke abruptly, groping after some vaguely remembered sound. A soft clicking of heels down the hall.... Of course, his mother back from the Spaceport! Now she would be stopping at his door to see if he were asleep. He lay silently; through his eyelashes he could see her outlined in the soft light from the hall. She was coming in to see if he was tucked in. In a moment he would jump up and startle her with a hug, as she leaned over him. In a moment....  Screaming desperately, he was out of bed, backing heedlessly across the room. He was still screaming as the low sill of the open window caught him behind the knees and toppled him thirty stories to the street.  Alone in the silent room, Helen Benton stood dazed, staring blindly at the empty window.  Tommy's parting gift from his father slid from her hand and lay on the carpet, still ticking gently.  It was 9:23 on Mars.   The End     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and     Fantasy_ July 1953.

A WIFE REPUDIATED.    Two lives that once part are as ships that divide,   When, moment on moment, there rushes between     The one and the other a sea--   Ah, never can fall from the days that have been   A gleam on the years that shall be.                                     BULWER LYTTON.   ""Very well, John; I have nothing more to say.  You can commence proceedings as soon as you choose.  I shall not contest them.""  The speaker was a slight, graceful woman of perhaps thirty-five years. Her figure was a little above the medium stature, and symmetrical, almost perfect, in its proportions.  Her beautiful, refined face and proudly poised, shapely head were crowned with a wealth of soft brown hair, in which there was a glint of red, and which lay in bright profusion above her white forehead, in charming contrast with the delicate fairness of her skin, which, at the present moment, was absolutely colorless.  Drawn to her full height, she was standing opposite her companion, her large, expressive gray eyes, in which pity and scorn struggled for supremacy, lifted to his in a direct, unflinching gaze which bespoke the strength of purpose and straightforward character of one who possessed the courage of her convictions; while, in her rich-toned voice, as well as in her crisp, decisive sentences, there was a note of finality which plainly indicated that she had taken her stand regarding the matter under discussion, and would abide by it.  ""What!  Am I to understand that you do not intend to contest proceedings for a divorce, Helen?""  Surprise and an unmistakable intonation of eagerness pervaded John Hungerford's tones as he spoke, while, at the same time, he searched his wife's face with a curious, almost startled, look.  At a casual glance the man impressed one as possessing an unusually attractive personality.  He had a fine, athletic figure--tall, broad-shouldered, well-proportioned--which, together with an almost military bearing, gave him a distinguished air, that instantly attracted attention wherever he went.  A clear olive complexion, dark-brown eyes and hair, handsomely molded features, and a luminous smile, that revealed white, perfect teeth, completed the _tout ensemble_ that had made havoc with not a few susceptible hearts, even before he had finally bestowed his coveted affections upon beautiful Helen Appleton, whom later he had made his wife.  But upon closer acquaintance one could not fail to detect disappointing lines in his face, and corresponding flaws in his character--a shifty eye, a weak mouth and chin, an indolent, ease-loving temperament, that would shirk every responsibility, and an insatiable desire for personal entertainment, that betrayed excessive selfishness and a lack of principle.  ""No,"" the woman coldly replied to her husband's exclamation of astonishment, ""I have no intention of opposing any action that you may see fit to take to annul our union, provided----""  She paused abruptly, a sudden alertness in her manner and tone.  ""Well?"" he questioned impatiently, and with a frown which betokened intolerance of opposition.  ""Provided you do not attempt to take Dorothy from me, or to compromise me in any way in your efforts to free yourself.""  The man shrugged his broad shoulders and arched his fine eyebrows.  ""I am not sighing for publicity for either you or myself, Helen,"" he observed.  ""I simply wish to get the matter settled as quickly and quietly as possible.  As for Dorothy, however----""  ""There can be no question about Dorothy; she is to be relinquished absolutely to me,"" Helen Hungerford interposed, with sharp decision.  ""You appear to be very insistent upon _that_ point,"" retorted her companion, with sneering emphasis and an unpleasant lifting of his upper lip that just revealed the tips of his gleaming teeth.  ""I certainly am; that my child remains with me is a foregone conclusion,"" was the spirited reply.  ""The judge may decree differently----""  ""You will not dare suggest it,"" returned the wife, in a coldly quiet tone, but with a dangerous gleam in her eyes.  ""No judge would render so unrighteous a decree if I were to tell my story, which I certainly should do if driven to it.  I have assented to your demand for this separation, but before I sign any papers to ratify the agreement you will legally surrender all claim to, or authority over, Dorothy.""  ""Indeed!  Aren't you assuming a good deal of authority for yourself, Helen?  You appear to forget that Dorothy is my child as well as yours--that I love her----""  ""_Love her!_""  Exceeding bitterness vibrated in the mother's voice. ""How have you shown your love for her?  However, it is useless to discuss that point.  I have given you my ultimatum--upon no other condition will I consent to this divorce,"" she concluded, with an air of finality there was no mistaking.  ""I swear I will not do it!"" John Hungerford burst forth, with sudden anger.  An interval of silence followed, during which each was apparently absorbed in troubled thought.  ""Possibly it will make no difference whether you do or do not accede to my terms,"" Mrs. Hungerford resumed, after a moment, ""for it has occurred to me that there is already a law regulating the guardianship of minors, giving the child a voice in the matter; and, Dorothy being old enough to choose her own guardian, there can be little doubt regarding what her choice would be.""  ""You are surely very sanguine,"" sneered her husband.  ""And why should I not be?"" demanded the woman, in a low but intense tone.  ""What have you to offer her?  What have you ever done for her, or to gain her confidence and respect, that could induce her to trust her future with you?  How do you imagine she will regard this last humiliation to which you are subjecting her and her mother?""  John Hungerford flushed a conscious crimson as these pertinent questions fell from the lips of his outraged wife.  His glance wavered guiltily, then fell before the clear, accusing look in her eyes.  ""Oh, doubtless you have her well trained in the rle she is to play,"" he sullenly observed, after an interval of awkward silence, during which he struggled to recover his customary self-assurance.  ""You have always indulged her lightest whim, and so have tied her securely to your apron strings, which, it goes without saying, has weakened my hold upon her.""  His companion made no reply to this acrid fling, but stood in an attitude of quiet dignity, awaiting any further suggestions he might have to offer.  But, having gained his main point--her consent to a legal separation--the man was anxious to close the interview and escape from a situation that was becoming exceedingly uncomfortable for him.  At the same time, he found it no easy matter to bring the interview to a close and take final leave of the wife whom he was repudiating.  ""Well, Helen,"" he finally observed, assuming a masterful tone to cover his increasing embarrassment, ""I may have more to say regarding Dorothy, later on--we will not discuss the matter further at present. Now, I am going--unless you have something else you wish to say to me.""  Helen Hungerford shivered slightly at these last words, and grew marble white.  Then she suddenly moved a step or two nearer to him, and lifted her beautiful face to him, a solemn light in her large gray eyes.  ""Yes, I have something else I would like to say to you, John,"" she said, her voice growing tremulous for the first time during their interview.  ""This separation is, as you know, of your own seeking, not mine.  A so-called divorce, though sanctioned a thousand times by misnamed law, means nothing to me.  When I married you I pledged myself to you until death should part us, and I would have held fast to my vows until my latest breath.  I may have made mistakes during the years we have lived together, but you well know that whenever I have taken a stand against your wishes it has always been for conscience's sake.  I have honestly tried to be a faithful wife--a true helpmeet, and a wise mother.  I have freely given you the very best there was in me to give. Now, at your decree, we are to part.  I make no contest--I hurl no reproaches--I simply submit.  But I have one last plea to make: I beg of you not to ruin your future in the way you are contemplating--you know what I mean--for life is worthless without an honored name, without the respect of your fellow men, and, above all, without _self-respect_.  You have rare talent--talent that would lift you high upon the ladder of fame and success, if you would cease to live an aimless, barren existence.  For your own sake, I pray you will not longer pervert it.  That is all.  Good-by, John; I hear Dorothy coming, and you may have something you would like to say before you go.""  She slipped quietly between the portires near which she had been standing, and was gone as a door opened to admit a bright, winsome lassie of about fifteen years.  Dorothy Hungerford strongly resembled her mother.  She was formed like her; she had the same pure complexion, the same large, clear gray eyes and wealth of reddish-brown hair, which hung in a massive braid--like a rope of plaited satin--between her shoulders, and was tied at the end with a great bow of blue ribbon.  The girl paused abruptly upon the threshold, and flushed a startled crimson as her glance fell upon her father.  ""Where--is mamma?"" she inquired, in evident confusion.  ""Your mother has just gone to her room,"" the man replied, his brows contracting with a frown of pain as he met his daughter's beautiful but clouded eyes.  ""Come in, Dorothy,"" he added, throwing a touch of brightness into his tones; ""I wish to have a little talk with you.""  The maiden reluctantly obeyed, moving forward a few paces into the room and gravely searching her father's face as she did so.  ""I suppose you know that I am going away, Dorothy?  Your mother has told you--ahem!--of the--the change I--we are contemplating?"" John Hungerford inquiringly observed, but with unmistakable embarrassment.  ""Yes, sir,"" said Dorothy, with an air of painful constraint.  ""How would you like to come with me, dear?  You have a perfect right to choose with whom you will live for the future.""  ""I choose to live with my mother!""  And there was now no constraint accompanying the girl's positive reply.  The man's right hand clenched spasmodically; then his dark eyes blazed with sudden anger.  ""Ha!  Evidently your mother has been coaching you upon the subject,"" he sharply retorted.  ""Mamma hasn't said a word to me about--about that part of the--the plan,"" Dorothy faltered.  ""Then you mean me to understand that, of your own free will, you prefer to remain with your mother altogether?""  Dorothy nodded her drooping head in assent, not possessing sufficient courage to voice her attitude.  ""Pray tell me what is your objection to living with me--at least for a portion of each year?""  The child did not immediately answer.  The situation was an exceedingly trying one, and she appeared to be turning her father's proposition over in her mind.  At length she lifted her head, and her eyes met his in a clear, direct gaze.  ""Where are you going to live?"" she questioned, with significant emphasis.  Her companion shrank before her look and words as if he had been sharply smitten.  ""That is not the question just at present,"" he said, quickly recovering himself.  ""I asked what objection you have to living with me.  Don't you love me at all?""  Again Dorothy's head fell, and, pulling the massive braid of her ruddy hair over her shoulder, she stood nervously toying with it in silence.  ""Dorothy, I wish you to answer me,"" her father persisted, greatly irritated by her attitude toward him, and growing reckless of consequences in his obstinate determination to force her to give him a definite answer.  But Dorothy was not devoid of obstinacy herself.  She pouted irresolutely a moment; then, tossing her braid back into its place, stood erect, and faced her father squarely.  ""Why are you going away--why will you not live here with mamma?""  Again the man flushed hotly.  He was guiltily conscious that she knew well enough why.  ""I--we are not congenial, and it is better that we live apart,"" he faltered, as he shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other. Then, becoming suddenly furious in view of being thus arraigned by his own child, he thundered: ""Now I command you to give me your reason for refusing to live with me during some portion of each year!  I know,"" he went on, more temperately, ""that you love your mother, and I would not wish to take you from her altogether; but I am your father--I certainly have some claim upon you, and it is natural that I should desire to keep you with me some of the time.  Now, tell me at once your objections to the plan,"" he concluded sternly.  The interview had been a severe strain upon the delicately organized and proud-spirited girl, and she had found great difficulty in preserving her self-control up to this point; but now his tone and manner were like spark to powder.  ""Because----  Oh, because I think you are just horrid!  I used to think you such a gentleman, and I was proud of you; but now you have shamed me so!  No, I don't love you, and I wouldn't go to live with you and--and _that dreadful woman_ for anything!"" she recklessly threw back at him.  For a minute John Hungerford stood speechless, staring blankly at his child, his face and lips colorless and drawn.  Her words had stabbed him cruelly.  ""Dorothy, you are impertinent!"" he said severely, when he could command his voice.  She caught her breath sharply; she bit her lips fiercely, her white teeth leaving deep imprints upon them; then passion swept all before it.  ""I know it--I _feel_ impertinent!  I feel awful wicked, as if I could do something dreadful!"" she cried shrilly and quivering from head to foot from mingled anger and grief.  ""You have broken mamma's heart, and it breaks mine, too, to see her looking so crushed and getting so white and thin.  And now you are going to put this open disgrace upon her--upon us both--just because you are tired of her and think you like some one else better.  I do love my mother--she is the dearest mother in the world, and I'm glad you're going.  I--I don't care if I never----""  Her voice broke sharply, at this point, into something very like a shriek.  She had wrought herself up to a frenzy of excitement, and now, with great sobs shaking her slight form like a reed, she turned abruptly away, and dashed wildly out of the room, slamming the door violently behind her.     CHAPTER II.  THE FINAL RUPTURE.  John Hungerford was stricken with astonishment and dismay by the foregoing outburst of passion from his child.  As a rule, she had ever been gentle and tractable, rarely defying his authority, and never before had he seen her manifest such temper as she had just given way to.  He had always believed that she loved him, although he had long been conscious of a growing barrier between them--that she invariably sought her mother's companionship when she was in the house, and held aloof from him.  But he had been so absorbed in his own pursuits that he had not given much serious thought to the matter; consequently it had now come like a bolt from a clear sky, when she had openly declared that she did not love him, while he was at no loss for words to complete the scathing, unfinished sentence to which she had given utterance just before she had fled from his presence.  It had taken him unawares, and, indifferent as he had become to his responsibilities as a husband and father; determined as he was to cut loose from them to gratify his pleasure-loving and vacillating disposition, his heart was now bruised and lacerated, his proud spirit humiliated as it never before had been, by Dorothy's passionate arraignment and bitter repudiation of him.  His wife, greatly to his surprise, had received him with her accustomed courtesy, had quietly acceded to his wishes when he informed her that he contemplated seeking a divorce, and had calmly told him that she had no intention of contesting his application for a legal separation.  He had not believed he would be able to secure his freedom so easily, and secretly congratulated himself that the matter had been so quickly adjusted, and had terminated without a scene, even though he had been not a little chagrined by his wife's dignified bearing and a certain conscious superiority throughout the interview; also by the absence of all excitement or sentiment, except as, now and then, a flash of scorn or pity for him leaped from her eyes or rang in her tones.  But it had been quite another thing to have Dorothy, whom he had always fondly loved, in his selfish way, so openly denounce him for his faithlessness to her mother, and impeach him for the humiliation to which he was about to subject them both.  As his anger subsided, as he began to realize something of what it meant, he was cut to the quick, and a sickening sense of loss and desolation suddenly swept over him, causing his throat to swell with painful tension and his eyes to sting with a rush of hot tears.  His only child--his pet and little playmate for fifteen years--had practically told him that she would not care if she never saw him again.  It seemed almost as if she had suddenly died and were lost to him forever.  He wondered if he ever would see her again, hear her fresh young voice calling ""papa,"" or feel her soft lips caressing his cheek.  He stood for several minutes staring miserably at the door through which she had disappeared, a long, quivering sigh heaving his broad chest.  Then his eyes swept the familiar, tastefully arranged room, which showed the graceful touch of his wife's deft hands in every detail, and finally rested upon the great bow of blue ribbon which had become loosened from Dorothy's hair and fallen to the floor almost at his feet.  He stooped, picked it up, and thrust it into his bosom; then mechanically took his hat, and quietly left the house.  But, as the outer door closed behind him, and the latch clicked sharply into its socket, there shot through all his nerves a thrill of keen pain which for many years repeated itself whenever the same sound fell upon his ears.  There seemed to be an ominous knell of finality in it, and, mingling with it, a sinister jeer at his supreme folly in thus turning his back forever upon this attractive, though comparatively simple, home, with its atmosphere of purity and sweet, refining influences; in discarding the beautiful and loyal woman whom he had once believed he adored; in abandoning and forfeiting the affection and respect of a lovely daughter, who also gave promise of becoming, in the near future, a brilliant and cultured woman, and--for what?  More than an hour elapsed after Dorothy fled from her father's presence before she could control herself sufficiently to seek her mother, who also had been fighting a mighty battle in the solitude of her own room. Even then the girl's eyes were red and swollen from excessive weeping; neither had she been able to overcome wholly the grief-laden sobs which, for the time, had utterly prostrated her.  ""Mamma, he has told me, and--he has gone,"" she faltered, almost on the verge of breaking down again, as she threw herself upon her knees by her mother's side and searched with anxious eyes the white, set face of the deserted wife.  ""Yes, dear; I heard him go.""  ""Do you think it will be forever?""  ""That is what a divorce--a legal separation--means, Dorothy.""  The girl dropped her head upon her mother's shoulder, with a moan of pain, and Helen slipped a compassionate arm around the trembling form.  ""Mamma,"" Dorothy began again, after a few moments of silence.  ""Well, dear?""  ""I think it is awful--what he is doing; but don't you think that we--you and I--can be happy again, by and by, just by ourselves?""  ""I am sure we can, dearest,"" was the brave response, as Helen Hungerford drew her daughter closer to her in a loving embrace.  Dorothy seized her mother's hand and kissed it passionately, two great, burning tears dropping upon it as she did so.  ""He asked me to go with him--to live with him some of the time,"" she presently resumed.  ""And you told him----"" breathed Helen, almost inaudibly.  ""I was very disrespectful, mamma,"" confessed the girl humbly; ""but I couldn't help it when I thought what it all meant.  I said I wouldn't live with him for anything--I almost told him that I wouldn't care if I never saw him again.  Where will he go now?  What will he do?  Will--he marry _that woman_?"" she concluded, her voice growing hard and tense again.  Her mother's lips grew blue and pinched with the effort she made to stifle a cry of agony at the shameful suggestion.  But she finally forced herself to reply, with some semblance of composure:  ""I do not know, Dorothy, and we will try not to worry over anything that he may do.  However, when he secures the necessary decree from the court he will have the legal right to do as he pleases.""  ""The _legal_ right,"" repeated Dorothy reflectively.  ""Yes, the law will give him the right to marry again if he wishes to do so.""  ""What an abominable law!  And what a shameful thing for any man to want to do, when he already has a family!  What will people think of us if he does?"" queried the girl, with a shiver of repulsion.  ""My dear, ask rather what people will think of _him_,"" said her mother tenderly, as she laid her lips in a gentle caress against the child's forehead.  ""Of course, I know that nice people will not respect him; but I can't help feeling that the shame of it will touch us, too,"" opposed sensitive Dorothy.  ""No, dear; what he has done, or may do, cannot harm either you or me in the estimation of our real friends,"" replied Helen, throwing a note of cheer she was far from feeling into her tones.  ""It can only bring condemnation upon himself, and you are not to feel any sense of degradation because of your father's wrongdoing.  We are simply the innocent victims of circumstances over which we have no control; and, Dorrie, you and I will so live that all who know us will be compelled to respect us for ourselves.""  Dorothy heaved a deep sigh of relief as her mother concluded, and her somber eyes brightened perceptibly.  She sat silently thinking for f several minutes; then a cloud again darkened her face.  ""Mamma,"" she began hesitatingly, ""you said the law would give p--him the right to do as he pleases--to marry that woman.  Can you do as you please?  Could you----""  ""Oh, hush, Dorothy!"" gasped the tortured wife, in a shocked tone, and laying an icy hand over the girl's lips.  ""When I married your father,"" she went on more calmly after a little, ""I promised to be true to him while we both lived, and you must never think of anything like that for me--never--_never_!  He may choose another, but I----  Oh, God, my burden is heavier than I can bear!""  Helen Hungerford buried her agonized face in her hands, cowering and shrinking from the repulsive suggestion as if she had been smitten with a lash.  Dorothy was shocked by the effect of her thoughtless question.  She had never seen her mother so unnerved before.  ""Oh, mamma, don't!"" she cried wildly.  ""I love you dearly--dearly--I did not mean to hurt you so, and I _hate_ him for making you so wretched--for putting this dreadful disgrace upon us both.  I will never forgive him--I never want to see him again.  I know it is wicked to hate, but I can't help it--I don't care!  I do--I do----""  These incoherent utterances ended in a piercing shriek as the overwrought girl threw herself prone upon the floor at her mother's feet, in a violent paroxysm of hysteria.  She was a sensitively organized child, proud as a young princess, and possessed of a high sense of honor; and grief over the threatened break in the family, together with fear of the opprobrium which she believed it would entail upon her idolized mother, as well as upon herself, had been preying upon her mind for several weeks; and now the climax had come, the cloud had burst, and, with the strenuous excitement and experiences of the day, had resulted in this nervous collapse.  Hours elapsed before Helen succeeded in soothing her into any degree of calmness, and when at last she fell into a deep sleep, from utter exhaustion, the forsaken wife found something very like hatred surging within her own heart toward the faithless man who had ruthlessly wrecked their happiness.  ""Neither will I forgive him for imposing this lifelong sorrow and taint upon my child,"" she secretly vowed as she sat through the long, lonely hours of the night, and watched beside the couch of her daughter.  In due time, she received formal announcement that her husband had secured his divorce, and that she also was free, by the decree of the court; and, following close upon this verdict, came the news that John Hungerford, the artist, had gone abroad again to resume his studies in Paris.  It was significant, too, at least to Helen, that the same papers stating this fact also mentioned that the Wells Opera Company, which had just finished a most successful season in San Francisco, was booked for a long engagement, with Madam Marie Duncan as leading soprano, in the same city; the opening performance was set for a date in the near future.     CHAPTER III.  A BACKWARD GLANCE.  Helen Gregory Appleton was the only child of cultured people, who, possessing a moderate fortune, had spared no pains or expense to give their daughter a thorough education, with the privilege of cultivating whatever accomplishments she preferred, or talent that she possessed.  Helen was an exceptionally bright girl, and, having conscientiously improved her opportunities, she had graduated from high school at the age of seventeen, and from a popular finishing school at twenty, a beautiful and accomplished young woman, the joy and pride of her devoted parents, who anticipated for her not only a brilliant social career, but also an auspicious settlement in life.  Her only hobby throughout her school life had been music, of which, from childhood, she had been passionately fond.  ""I don't care for drawing or painting,"" she affirmed, ""so I will stick to music, and try to do one thing well.""  And with no thought of ever making it a profession, but simply for love of it, she had labored tirelessly to acquire proficiency in this accomplishment, with the result that she not only excelled as a pianist, but was also a pleasing vocalist--attainments which, later in life, were destined to bring her rich returns for her faithful study.  It was during her last year in school that she had met John Hungerford, a graduate of Yale College, and a promising young man, possessing great personal attractions.  He was bright, cheerful, and witty, always looking for the humorous side of life; while, being of an easy-going temperament, he avoided everything like friction in his intercourse with others, which made him a very harmonious and much-sought-after companion.  Naturally courteous, genial, and quick at repartee, enthusiastically devoted to athletic sports, ever ready to lead in a frolic and to entertain lavishly, he was generally voted an ""all-around jolly good fellow.""  Hence he had early become a prime favorite with his class, and also with the faculty, and remained such throughout his course.  He was not a brilliant scholar, however, and barely succeeded in winning his degree at the end of his four years' term.  He did not love study; he lacked application and tenacity of purpose, except in sports, or such things as contributed to his personal entertainment.  At the same time, he had too much pride to permit him to fail to secure his diploma, and he managed to win out; but with just as little work and worry as possible.  The only direction in which he had ever shown a tendency to excel was in art, the love of which he had inherited from his paternal grandfather, who, in his day, had won some renown, both abroad and in his own country, as a landscape painter; and from early boyhood ""John Hungerford, Second""--his namesake--had shown unmistakable talent in the same direction.  Possessing a small fortune, which had fallen to him from this same relative, the young man had given scarcely a serious thought to his future.  Life had always been a bright gala day to him; money was easy, friends were plenty, and, with perfect health, what more could he ask of the years to come?  And when questioned regarding what business or profession he purposed to follow, on leaving college, he would reply, with his usual irresponsible manner: ""It will be time enough to decide that matter later on.  I propose to see something of the world, and have some fun, before settling down to the humdrum affairs of life.""  Once the formality of their introduction was over, John had proceeded forthwith to fall desperately in love with beautiful Helen Appleton, and, as she reciprocated his affection, an early engagement had followed.  Six months later they were married, and sailed for Europe, with the intention of making an extensive tour abroad.  Helen's parents had not sanctioned this hurried union without experiencing much anxiety and doubt regarding the wisdom of giving their idolized daughter to one whom they had known for so short a time. But young Hungerford's credentials had appeared to be unquestionable, his character above reproach, his personality most winning, and his means ample; thus there had seemed no reasonable objection to the marriage.  The young man's wooing had been so eager, and Helen so enamored of her handsome lover, who swept before him every argument or obstacle calculated to retard the wedding with such plausible insistence, that the important event had been consummated almost before they could realize what it might mean to them all when the excitement and glamour had worn away.  Frequent letters came to them from the travelers, filled with loving messages, with enthusiastic descriptions of their sight-seeing, and expressions of perfect happiness in each other; and the fond father and mother, though lonely without their dear one, comforted themselves with assurances that all was well with her, and they would soon have her back with them again.  After spending a year in travel and sight-seeing, the young couple drifted back to Paris, from which point they intended, after John had made another round of the wonderful art galleries, which had enthralled him upon their previous visit, to proceed directly home.  But the artist element in him became more and more awakened, as, day after day, he studied the world-renowned treasures all about him, until he suddenly conceived the idea of making art his profession and life work; whereupon, he impulsively registered himself for a course in oils, under a popular artist and teacher, Monsieur Jacques by name.  Helen would have preferred to return to her parents, for she yearned for familiar scenes, and particularly for her mother at this time; but she yielded her will to her husband's, and they made a pretty home for themselves in an attractive suburb of Paris, where, a little later, there came to the young wife, in her exile--for such it almost seemed to her--a great joy.  A little daughter, the Dorothy of our opening chapter, was born to John and Helen Hungerford a few weeks after the anniversary of their marriage; and, being still deeply in love with each other, it seemed to them as if their cup of happiness was filled to the brim.  Shortly afterward, however, with only a few days between the two sad events, cable messages brought the heartbreaking tidings that Helen's father and mother had both been taken from her, and the blow, for the time, seemed likely to crush her.  John, in his sympathy for his wife, was for immediately throwing up his work, and taking her directly home; but Helen, more practical and less impulsive than her husband, reasoned that there was nothing to be gained by such a rash move, while much would have to be sacrificed in forfeiting his course of lessons, which had been paid for in advance; while she feared that such an interruption would greatly abate his enthusiasm, if it did not wholly discourage him from the task of perfecting himself in his studies.  She knew that her father's lawyer, who had been his adviser for many years, was amply qualified to settle Mr. Appleton's business; and, having unbounded confidence in him, she felt that whatever would be required of her could be done as well by correspondence as by her personal presence.  Consequently it was decided best to remain where they were until John should become well grounded in his profession, and able to get on without a teacher.  But when Mr. Appleton's affairs were settled it was learned that the scant sum of five thousand dollars was all that his daughter would inherit from his estate.  This unlooked-for misfortune was a great surprise to the young husband and wife; a bitter disappointment, also, particularly to John Hungerford, who had imagined, when he married her, that Helen would inherit quite a fortune from her father, who, it was generally believed, had amassed a handsome property.  Helen very wisely decided that the five thousand dollars must be put aside for Dorothy's future education, and she directed the lawyer to invest the money for the child, as his best judgment dictated, and allow the interest to accumulate until they returned to America.  Three years slipped swiftly by after this, and during this time John, who seemed really to love his work, gave promise of attaining proficiency, if not fame, in his profession.  At least, Monsieur Jacques, who appeared to take a deep interest in his student's progress, encouraged him to believe he could achieve something worth while in the future, provided he applied himself diligently to that end.  Helen, though chastened and still grieving sorely over the loss of her parents, was happy and content to live very quietly, keeping only one servant, and herself acting the part of nurse for Dorothy.  Before her marriage she had supposed John to be the possessor of considerable wealth, and this belief had been confirmed during their first year abroad by his lavish expenditure.  He had spared no expense to contribute to her pleasure, had showered expensive gifts upon her, and gratified every whim of his own.  But when her father's estate had been settled he had betrayed deep disappointment and no little anxiety in view of the small amount coming to Helen; and it had finally come out that his own fortune had been a very moderate one, the greater portion of which had been consumed during their extravagant honeymoon.  This startling revelation set Helen to thinking very seriously.  She realized that the limited sum remaining to them would have to be carefully husbanded, or they would soon reach the end of their resources.  John's studies were expensive, and it might be some time yet before he could expect to realize from his profession an income that could be depended upon, while, never yet having denied himself anything he wanted, he had no practical idea of economy.  At length he sold a few small pictures, which, with some help in touching up from monsieur, were very creditable to him.  But instead of being elated that his work was beginning to attract attention and be appreciated, he was greatly chagrined at the prices he received for them, and allowed himself to become somewhat discouraged in view of these small returns; and, during his fourth year, it became evident that his interest was waning, and he was growing weary of his work.  He had never been a systematic worker, much to the annoyance of his teacher, who was rigidly methodical and painstaking in every detail. John would begin a subject which gave promise of being above the ordinary, and work well upon it for a while; but after a little it would pall upon his fancy, and be set aside to try something else, while Monsieur Jacques would look on with grave disapproval, and often sharply criticize such desultory efforts.  This, of course, caused strained relations between teacher and student, and conditions drifted from bad to worse, until he began to absent himself from the studio; at first for only a day in the week; then, as time went on, he grew more and more irregular, and sometimes several days would elapse during which he would do nothing at his easel, while no one seemed to know where, or with whom, he was spending his time.  Monsieur Jacques was very forbearing.  He knew the young man possessed rare talent, if not real genius; he believed there was the promise of a great artist in him, and he was ambitious to have him make his mark in the world.  He was puzzled by his peculiar moods and behavior, and strove in various ways to arouse his waning enthusiasm.  He knew nothing of his circumstances, except that he had a lovely wife and child, of whom he appeared to be very fond and proud, and he believed him to be possessed of ample means, for he spent money freely upon himself and his fellow students, with whom he was exceedingly popular; hence he was wholly unable to account for his growing indifference and indolence, unless there were some secret, subtle influence that was leading him astray--beguiling him from his high calling.  Two years more passed thus, and still he had made no practical advancement.  He worked by fits and starts, but rarely completed and sold anything, even though everything he attempted was, as far as developed, alive with brilliant possibilities.  Helen had also realized, during this time, that something was very wrong with her husband.  He was often away from home during the evening, and had little to say when she questioned him regarding his absence; sometimes he told her he had been at the theater with the boys, or he had been bowling at the club, or having a game of whist at the studio.  She was very patient; she believed in him thoroughly, and not a suspicion arose in her loyal heart that he would tell her a falsehood to conceal any wrongdoing on his part.  But one night he did not return at all; at least, it was early morning before he came in, and, not wishing to disturb his wife, he threw himself, half dressed, upon the couch in the library, where Helen found him, in a deep sleep, when she came downstairs in the morning.  She appeared relieved on seeing him, and stood for a minute or two curiously searching his face, noting how weary and haggard he looked after his night of evident dissipation, while the odor of wine was plainly perceptible in his heavy breathing.  Her heart was very sore, but she was careful not to wake him, for she felt he needed to sleep, and she presently moved away from him, gathering up the light overcoat he had worn the previous evening, and which he had heedlessly thrown in a heap upon a chair on removing it. She gently shook out the wrinkles, preparatory to putting the garment away in its place, when something bright, hanging from an inner pocket, caught her eye.  With the color fading from her face, she drew it forth and gazed at it as one dazed.  It was a long, silken, rose-hued glove, that exhaled a faint odor of attar of roses as it slipped from its hiding place.  It was almost new, yet the shape of the small hand that had worn it was plainly discernible, while on one of the rounded finger tips there was a slight stain, like a drop of wine.  To whom did the dainty thing belong?  How had it come into her husband's possession?  Had it been lost by some one returning from a ball, or the opera, and simply been found by him?  Or had it some more significant connection with the late hours and carousal of the previous night and of many other nights?  A hundred questions and cruel suspicions flashed thick and fast through her mind and stung her to the quick, as she recalled the many evenings he had spent away from her of late, and his evasive replies whenever she had questioned him regarding his whereabouts.  She shivered as she stood there, almost breathless, with that creepy, slippery thing that seemed almost alive, and a silent, mocking witness to some tantalizing mystery, in her hand.  What should she do about it?  Should she wake John, show him what she had found, and demand an explanation from him?  Or would it be wiser to return the glove to its place of concealment, say nothing, and bide her time for further developments?  She had never been a dissembler.  As a girl, she was artless and confiding, winning and keeping friends by her innate sincerity.  As a wife, she had been absolutely loyal and trustful--never before having entertained the slightest doubt of her husband's faithfulness to her. Could she now begin to lead a double life, begin to be suspicious of John, to institute a system of espionage upon his actions and pursuits, and thus create an ever-increasing barrier between them?  The thought was utterly repulsive to her, and yet it might perhaps be as well not to force, for a time, at least, a situation which perchance would ere long be unfolded to her without friction or estrangement.  She glanced from the rose-hued thing in her hand to the sleeper on the couch, stood thoughtfully studying his face for a moment; then she silently slipped the glove into the pocket where she had found it, dropped the coat back in a heap upon the chair, and stole noiselessly from the room.     CHAPTER IV.  A YOUNG WIFE'S BRAVE STRUGGLES.  Another year slipped by, with no change for the better in the domestic conditions of the Hungerfords.  When he felt like it, John would work at his easel; when he did not, he would dawdle his time away at his club, or about town, with companions whom, Helen began to realize, were of no advantage to him, to say the least.  Meantime, his money was fast melting away, and there seemed to be no prospect of a reliable income from his art.  Helen became more and more anxious regarding their future, and often implored her husband to finish some of his pictures, try to get them hung at different exhibitions, and in this way perhaps find a market for them.  He was never really unkind to her, though often irritable; yet he was far from being the devoted husband he had been during the first three or four years of their married life.  He would often make fair promises to do better, and perhaps work well for a while; then, his interest flagging again, he would drop back into his indolent ways, and go on as before.  One morning, just as he was leaving the house, John informed his wife that he was going, with several other artists, to visit a noted chteau a few miles out of Paris, where there was a wonderful collection of paintings, comprising several schools of art, some of the oldest and best masters being represented; and the owner of these treasures, the Duc de Mouvel, had kindly given them permission to examine them and take notes at their leisure.  It was a rare opportunity, he told her, and she was not to be anxious about him if he did not reach home until late in the evening.  Helen was quite elated by this information; it seemed to indicate that John still loved his art, and she hoped that his enthusiasm would be newly aroused by this opportunity to study such priceless pictures, and he would resume his work with fresh zeal upon his return.  She was very happy during the day, refreshing herself with these sanguine hopes, and did not even feel troubled that John did not come back at all that night.  The owner of the chteau had probably extended his hospitality, and given the students another day to study his pictures, she thought.  The third day dawned, and still her husband had not returned; neither had he sent her any message explaining his protracted absence.  Unable longer to endure the suspense, Helen went in town, to the studio, hoping that Monsieur Jacques might be able to give her some information regarding the expedition to the Chteau de Mouvel.  But her heart sank the moment she came into the artist's presence.  He greeted her most cordially, but searched her face curiously; then gravely inquired:  ""And where is Monsieur Hungerford, madame?  I hope not ill?  For a week now his brushes they have been lying idle.""  ""A week!"" repeated Helen, with an inward shock of dismay.  ""Then, Monsieur Jacques, you know nothing about the excursion to the chteau of le Duc de Mouvel?""  ""Excursion to the galleries of le Duc de Mouvel!"" exclaimed the artist, astonished.  ""But surely I know nothing of such a visit--no, madame.""  Helen explained more at length, and mentioned the names of some of those whom John had said were to be of the party.  Her companion's brow contracted in a frown of mingled sorrow and displeasure.  ""I know nothing of it,"" he reiterated; ""and the persons madame has named are dilettante--they are 'no good,' as you say in America.  They waste time--they have a love for wine, women, and frolic; and it is regrettable that monsieur finds pleasure in their company.""  Helen sighed; her heart was very heavy.  ""Monsieur is one natural artist,"" the master resumed, bending a compassionate gaze on her white face; ""born with talent and the love of art.  He has the true eye for color, outline, perspective; the free, steady, skillful hand.  He would do great work with the stable mind, but--pardon, madame--he is what, in English, you call--lazy.  He will not exercise the necessary application.  To make the great artist there must be more, much more, than mere talent, the love of the beautiful, and skillful wielding of the brush; there must be the will to work, work, work.  Ah, if madame could but inspire monsieur with ambition--real enthusiasm--to accomplish something, to finish his pictures, he might yet win fame for himself; but the indifference, the indolence, the lack of moral responsibility, and the love of pleasure--ah, it all means failure!""  ""But--the Duc de Mouvel--is there such a man?  Has he a rare collection?"" faltered Helen, thus betraying her suspicion that her husband had deceived her altogether regarding the motive of his absence.  ""Yes, my child; I have the great pleasure of acquaintance with le Duc de Mouvel,"" kindly returned Monsieur Jacques, adding: ""He is a great connoisseur in, and a generous patron of, all that is best in art; and if he has extended to your husband and his friends an invitation to view the wonderful pictures in his magnificent chteau at ---- they have been granted a rare honor and privilege.""  In her heart, Helen doubted that they had ever been the recipients of such an invitation; she believed it all a fabrication to deceive her and perhaps others.  It was a humiliating suspicion; but it forced itself upon her and thrust its venomed sting deep into her soul.  ""If there is anything I can do for madame at any time, I trust she will not fail to command me,"" Monsieur Jacques observed, with gentle courtesy, and breaking in upon the troubled reverie into which she had fallen.  Helen lifted her sad eyes to his.  ""I thank you, monsieur,"" she gratefully returned.  ""You are--you always have been--most kind and patient.""  Then, glancing searchingly around the room, the walls of which were covered with beautiful paintings, she inquired: ""Are there any of Mr. Hungerford's pictures here?""  ""Ah!  Madame would like to see some of the work monsieur has been doing of late?"" said the artist alertly, and glad to change the subject, for he saw that his proffered kindness had well-nigh robbed her of her composure.  ""Come this way, if you please, and I will show you,"" he added, turning to leave the room.  He led her through a passage to a small room in the rear of the one they had just left; and, some one coming to speak to him just then, excusing himself, he left her there to look about at her leisure.  This was evidently John's private workroom; but it was in a very dusty and untidy condition, and Helen was appalled to see the many unfinished subjects which were standing against the walls, in the windows, and even upon chairs.  Some were only just begun; others were well under way, and it would have required but little time and effort to have completed them and made them salable.  She moved slowly about the place, pausing here and there to study various things that appealed to her, and at the same time recognizing the unmistakable talent that was apparent in almost every stroke of the brush.  At length she came to a small easel that had been pushed close into a corner.  There was a canvas resting on it, with its face turned to the wall, and curiosity prompted her to reverse it to ascertain the subject, when a cry of surprise broke from her lips as she found herself gazing upon the unfinished portrait of a most beautiful woman.  John had never seemed to care to do portraits--they were uninteresting, he had always said--and she had never known of his attempting one before; hence her astonishment.  The figure had been painted full length.  It was slight, but perfect in its proportions; the pose exceedingly graceful and natural, the features delicate, the coloring exquisite.  The eyes were a deep blue, arch and coquettish in expression; the hair a glossy, waving brown, a few bewitching locks falling softly on the white forehead, beneath a great picture hat.  The costume was an evening gown of black spangled net, made _dcolett_, and with only an elaborate band of jet over the shoulders, the bare neck and beautifully molded arms making an effective contrast against the glittering, coal-black dress.  The girl was standing by a small oval table, one hand resting lightly upon it, the other hanging by her side, and loosely holding a pair of long silken gloves.  Helen's face flooded crimson as her glance fell upon the gloves.  Even though they were black, they were startlingly suggestive to her, and her thought instantly reverted to the one, so bright-hued, which she had found in the inner pocket of her husband's overcoat some months previous.  Had she to-day inadvertently stumbled upon the solution of that mystery which had never ceased to rankle, with exceeding bitterness, in her heart from that day to this?  There was still much to be done before the picture would be finished, though it was a good deal further along than most of its companions. Enough had been accomplished, however, to show that there had been no lack of interest on the part of the artist while at work upon it.  Who was she--this blue-eyed, brown-haired siren in glittering black? When and where had the portrait been painted?  Had the woman come there, to John's room, for sittings?  Or was she some one whom he met often, and had painted from memory?  Helen did not believe she could be a model; there was too much about her that hinted at high life, and of habitual association with the fashionable world--possibly of the stage.  She stood a long time before the easel, studying every line of the lovely face until she found that, with all its beauty, there was a suggestion of craftiness and even cruelty in the dark-blue eyes and in the lines about the mouth and sensuous chin.  A step behind her caused Helen to start and turn quickly, to find Monsieur Jacques almost beside her, his eyes fastened intently, and in unmistakable surprise, upon the picture she had discovered.  ""Who is she?"" she demanded, almost sharply, and voicing the query she had just put to herself.  ""Madame, I have never before looked upon the picture--I did not even know that Monsieur Hungerford had attempted a portrait,"" gravely returned the artist.  ""It is finely done, however,"" he added approvingly.  ""Has no woman been here for sittings?""  ""No, madame; no one except our own models--I am sure not.  That is not allowed in my studio without my sanction and supervision,"" was the reply.  ""It may be simply a study, original with monsieur; if so, it is very beautiful, and holds great promise,"" the man concluded, with hearty appreciation.  Helen replaced the portrait as she had found it, somewhat comforted by her companion's assurance and high praise of her husband's effort; then she turned to leave the room.  ""I thank you, monsieur, for your courtesy,"" she said, holding out to him a hand that trembled visibly from inward excitement.  ""Pray do not mention it, but come again, my child, whenever I can be of service to you.  _Au revoir_,"" he responded kindly, as he accompanied her to the door and bowed her out.  Helen went home with a heavy heart.  She was well-nigh discouraged with what she had heard and seen.  She had long suspected, and she was now beginning to realize, that her husband's chief aim in life was personal entertainment and love of ease; that he was sadly lacking in force of character, practical application, and moral responsibility; caring more about being rated a jolly good fellow by his boon companions than for his duties as a husband and father, or for attaining fame in his profession.  Thus she spent a very unhappy day, haunted continually by that portrait, and brooding anxiously over what the future might hold for them; while, at the same time, she was both indignant and keenly wounded in view of John's improvidence, prodigality, and supreme selfishness, and of his apparent indifference to her peace of mind and the additional burdens he was constantly imposing upon her.  John returned that evening, in a most genial mood.  He made light of his protracted absence and of Helen's anxiety on account of it, but offered no apologies for keeping her in suspense for so long.  He briefly remarked that the party had concluded to extend their tour, and make more of an outing than they had at first planned.  It had evidently been a very enjoyable one, although he did not go into detail at all, and when Helen inquired about the Duc de Mouvel's wonderful collection of paintings, he appeared somewhat confused, but said they were ""grand, remarkable, and absolutely priceless!"" then suddenly changed the subject.  Helen's suspicion that the party had never been inside the Chteau de Mouvel was confirmed by his manner; but she was too hurt and proud to question him further, and so did not pursue the subject.  She thought it only right, however, to tell him of her visit to Monsieur Jacques, and what the artist had said about his talent, and the flattering possibilities before him, if he would conscientiously devote himself to his work.  She referred to his disapproval of his present course, and the company he was keeping; whereupon John became exceedingly angry, in view of her ""meddling,"" as he termed it; said Monsieur Jacques would do better to give more attention to his own affairs, and less to his; then, refusing to discuss the situation further, he abruptly left the room in a very sulky frame of mind.  Helen had debated with herself as to the advisability of telling him of her discovery of the portrait.  She did not like to conceal anything from her husband.  She felt that every such attempt only served to establish a more formidable barrier between them; but after the experience of to-night she thought it would be wiser not to refer to the matter--at least until later.  John evidently did some thinking on his own part that night, for he was more like his former self when he appeared at breakfast the next morning, and proceeded directly to the studio on leaving the house.  He did better for a couple of months afterward, manifested more interest in his work, and finished a couple of pictures, which, through the influence of Monsieur Jacques, were hung at an exhibition and sold at fair prices, greatly to Helen's joy.  But instead of being inspired to even greater effort by this success, John seemed content to rest upon his honors, and soon began to lapse again into his former indolent ways, apparently indifferent to the fact that his money was almost gone, and poverty staring himself and his family in the face.  Long before this, Helen had given up her maid, had practiced economy in every possible way, and denied herself many things which she had always regarded as necessary to her comfort.  But the more she gave up, the more John appeared to expect her to give up; the harder she worked, the less he seemed to think he was obliged to do himself.  Thus, with her domestic duties, her sewing, and the care of Dorothy, every moment of the day, from the hour of rising until she retired at night, the young wife was heavily burdened with toilsome and unaccustomed duties.  It was a bitter experience for this delicately nurtured girl, but no word of repining ever escaped her lips.  She had pledged herself to John ""for better or worse,"" and, despite the unremitting strain upon her courage, patience, and strength, despite her increasing disappointment in and constantly waning respect for her husband, she had no thought but to loyally abide by her choice, and share his lot, whatever it might be.  The day came, however, when John himself awoke to the fact that he had about reached the end of his rope--when he was startled to find that less than two hundred dollars remained to his credit in the bank, and poverty treading close upon his heels.  He knew he could no longer go on in this desultory way; something radical must be done, and done at once.  He was tired of his art; he was tired of facing, day after day, Monsieur Jacques' grave yet well-deserved disapproval; while, for some reason, he had become weary of Paris, and, one morning, to Helen's great joy--for she believed it the best course to pursue--he suddenly announced his intention to return to the United States.  They sublet their house, and were fortunate in selling their furniture, just as it stood, to the new tenant, thus realizing sufficient funds, with what money they already possessed, to comfortably defray all expenses back to San Francisco, which had been their former home, and to which Helen had firmly insisted upon returning, although John had voiced a decided preference for New York.  ""No, I am going home--to my friends,"" she reiterated, but with her throat swelling painfully as she thought she would find no father and mother there to greet her.  ""I have lived in exile long enough; I need--I am hungry to see familiar faces.""  ""But----"" John began, with a rising flush.  ""Yes, I know, we are going back poor,"" said his wife, reading his thought as he hesitated; ""but my real friends will not think any the less of me for that, and they will be a comfort to me.  Besides, all the furniture of my old home is stored there, and it will be useful to us in beginning life again.""  During the voyage Helen seemed happier than she had been for months. The freedom from household cares and drudgery was a great boon to her, and the rest, salt air, and change of food were doing her good; while the anticipation of once more being among familiar scenes and faces was cheering, even exhilarating, to her.  To Dorothy the ocean was a great marvel and delight, and it was a pleasant sight to see the beautiful mother and her attractive little daughter pacing the deck together, enjoying the novelty of their surroundings, watching the white-capped waves, or the foaming trail in the wake of the huge vessel, their bright faces and happy laughter attracting the attention of many an appreciative observer.  John, on the contrary, was listless and moody, spending his time mostly in reading, smoking, and sleeping in his steamer chair, apparently taking little interest in anything that was going on about him, or giving much thought to what was before him at his journey's end.  One morning Helen came on deck with two or three recent magazines, which a chance acquaintance had loaned her.  She handed two of them to her husband, and, tucking herself snugly into her own chair, proceeded to look over the other, with Dorothy standing beside her to see the pictures.  By and by the child ran away to play, and Helen became interested in a story.  A half hour passed, and she had become deeply interested in the tale she was reading, when she was startled by a smothered exclamation from John.  She glanced at him, to find him gazing intently at a picture in one of the magazines she had given him.  The man's face was all aglow with admiration and pleased surprise, and she noted that the hand which held the periodical trembled from some inward emotion.  Wondering what could have moved him so, yet feeling unaccountably reluctant to question him, she appeared not to notice his excitement, and composedly went on with her reading.  Presently he arose, saying he was going aft for a smoke, and left her alone; but, to her great disappointment, taking the magazine with him.  Later in the day, on going to their stateroom, however, she found it in his berth, tucked under his pillow!  Eagerly seizing it, she began to search it through, when suddenly, on turning a leaf, a great shock went quivering through her, for there on the page before her was the picture of a woman, the exact counterpart of the half-finished portrait she had seen in John's work-room during her visit to Monsieur Jacques.  Like a flash, her eyes dropped to the name beneath it.  ""Marie Duncan, with the Wells Opera Company, now in Australia,"" was what she read.  On the opposite page was a brief account of the troupe and the musical comedy, which, during the past season, had had an unprecedented run in Paris, and was now making a great hit in Melbourne, Miss Duncan, the star, literally taking the public by storm.  ""Well, _that_ mystery is finally solved!  And doubtless she was the owner of that pink glove, also,"" mused Helen, her lips curling with fine scorn, as she studied the fascinating face before her.  ""Thank fortune,"" she presently added, with a sigh of thankfulness, as she closed the book and replaced it under the pillow, ""she is away in Australia, and we are every day increasing the distance between us.""  She kept her own counsel, however, and gave no sign of the discovery she had made.  The day preceding their landing in New York, Helen asked her husband what plans he had made for their future, how he expected to provide for their support upon reaching San Francisco.  ""Oh, I don't know!"" he replied, somewhat irritably.  ""Possibly I may ask Uncle Nathan to give me a position in his office.""  ""And give up your art, John!"" exclaimed Helen, in a voice of dismay, adding: ""You are better fitted for that than for anything else.""  ""But I shall have to do something to get a start.  You know, it takes money to live while one is painting pictures,"" he moodily returned.  ""But it would not take very long to finish up some of them--the best ones; and I feel sure they would sell readily,"" said his wife.  ""The best ones would require the help of a good teacher, or an expert artist, to complete,"" her husband curtly replied.  Helen sighed regretfully over the time which had been so wantonly wasted in Paris, and during which, under the skillful supervision of Monsieur Jacques, he might have finished much of his work, and at the same time perfected himself upon many important points.  She preserved a thoughtful silence for several moments; then gravely inquired:  ""Do you suppose, John, that, with another year of study, with some good teacher, you could finish and dispose of the various subjects you have begun?""  ""Possibly I might,"" he briefly observed, but there was very little enthusiasm in his tone or manner.  ""Do you feel in the mood?  Have you any ambition for honest, painstaking effort--for hard work, John, to attempt this under a first-class artist?"" Helen persisted.  The man began to grow restive; he could never bear to be pinned down to committing himself to anything, or to yield a point.  ""You have no idea, Helen, what a grind it is to sit before an easel day after day, and wield a brush,"" he said, in an injured tone, and with a frown of annoyance.  ""Everything is a grind unless you put your heart into your work--unless one is governed by principle and a sense of moral responsibility,"" said Helen gravely.  ""Is that the way you have baked and brewed, washed dishes and made beds the past year?"" queried her husband, with a covert sneer.  ""I certainly never baked and brewed, or washed dishes, solely from love of the work,"" she quietly but significantly replied, as her glance rested upon her wrist, where a faint scar was visible--the fading reminder of a serious burn sustained when she first began her unaccustomed duties as cook and maid of all work.  John observed it also, then quickly looked away, as he remembered that she had never murmured or neglected a single duty on account of it.  ""But where is the money for a teacher coming from?"" he inquired, after a moment, and referring to Helen's unanswered question regarding his unfinished work.  ""You know Dorothy's money has been accumulating all these years,"" she began in reply.  ""The interest now amounts to upward of fifteen hundred dollars, and I will consent to use it for this purpose, if you will agree to do your level best to make your unfinished pictures marketable during the coming year.""  Her husband flushed hotly--not because he experienced either gratitude or a sense of shame in view of becoming dependent upon his wife's bounty, but because it angered him to have conditions made for him.  He appeared to be utterly devoid of ambition for his future, and Helen's suggestion possessed no real attraction for him.  Painting had become a bore--the last thing he had really taken any interest in having been the portrait his wife had discovered in his studio just previous to the sailing of its original for Australia.  John Hungerford had never performed a day's manual labor in his life, and even though he had said he might ask his uncle for a position on his arrival in San Francisco, he had no relish for the prospect of buckling down to a humdrum routine of duties in Nathan Young's flourishing manufactory.  He sat chewing the cud of sullen discontent for some time, while considering the situation, and finally gave Helen a half-hearted promise to stick to his art, under a teacher, for another year.  But his consent had been so reluctantly given, his manner was so indifferent, Helen felt that she had received very little encouragement to warrant that the future would show any better results than the past, and the outlook seemed rather dark to her.     CHAPTER V.  FLUCTUATING EXPERIENCES.  Upon their arrival in San Francisco, the Hungerfords took a small apartment in a quiet but good location, where Helen felt she could ask her friends, and they would not hesitate to come to see her.  This she tastefully fitted up with some of the simplest of her old-home furniture, which her father's lifelong friend and lawyer had carefully stored for her against her return.  The more expensive pieces, with some massive, valuable silver, and choice bric-a-brac that Mr. Appleton had purchased to embellish the beautiful new residence which he had built a few years previous to his death--these extravagances having really been the beginning of his undoing--she sold, thus realizing several hundred dollars, which would go far, with careful management, toward tiding over the interval during which John was working to turn his paintings into money.  As yet Dorothy had never attended school, Helen having systematically taught her at home; but the child was bright and quick to learn, and was fully up to the standard with, if not in advance of, girls of her own age.  She could speak French like a Parisian, and her mother had also given her excellent training in music.  Helen, thus far, had been very wise in her management of Dorothy. Profiting by the mistakes which she realized her own indulgent parents had made in rearing herself, as well as by the faults she had detected in her husband's character, she had determined that her daughter should not suffer in the future, along the same lines, for lack of careful discipline.  At the same time, she by no means made her government irksome; indeed, it never seemed to the child that she was being governed, for the companionship between them was so close and tender that she fell naturally into her mother's way of thinking, and seldom rebelled against her authority, even though she was by no means devoid of spirit or a mind of her own.  Now, however, feeling that Dorothy needed a wider horizon, with different environment and training, as she pursued her education, her mother decided to put her into the public school.  This would relieve Helen of much care, and also give her more time to take up a systematic course of piano and voice culture, which she had determined to do, with the view of turning her talent for music to some practical purpose, at least until her husband was better equipped to provide suitably for his family.  She had been cordially received on her return by most of her old friends, even though she had made no secret of the change in her circumstances.  She had been a great favorite before her marriage, and her family highly respected; hence her reverses did not now appear to affect her social standing, at least among those who knew her best.  Very grateful and happy in view of this proof of real friendship, Helen was encouraged to quietly seek pupils in music, and easily secured a class of ten, which were all she felt she could do justice to with her domestic duties and other cares.  She felt very independent and not a little proud of the money thus earned, while she found it a great help in meeting the many expenses of her household.  During the first year after their return from abroad, John also worked well.  He liked his teacher--a German, who had studied many years in Italy--who spoke in high praise of his talent, as well as of the thoroughness of the instruction he had received from Monsieur Jacques, all of which was apparent in his beautiful but unfinished work, he said.  Although Herr Von Meyer was not permanently located in San Francisco, his work had become popular, and he had quite a large following as students.  He might almost have been called an itinerant artist, for he had traveled extensively in the United States and Canada, stopping for a longer or shorter time, as his fancy dictated, in numerous places, painting and sketching American life and scenery.  He was now planning to return to his own country at the end of another year, to again take up work in his own studio in Berlin.  It was, therefore, a rare opportunity for John to have found so talented a teacher just at this time; and, under his supervision, he completed and disposed of a goodly number of his paintings.  Some of these were so well appreciated that he received orders to duplicate them, and the future looked promising.  This success so elated and encouraged him that at the end of a year he concluded he was now competent to do business for himself without further assistance or instruction.  Accordingly, he hired some rooms, furnished them attractively, and launched out upon an independent career with something like real enthusiasm.  For a time all went well; more pictures were painted and sold, bringing good prices; while, after the departure of Herr Von Meyer, students began to flock to him.  Young Hungerford, the artist, was beginning to be talked about in society and at the various clubs; he was also much sought after and admired in fashionable circles; his studio became a favorite resort for people interested in art, and here John shone a bright particular star.  Helen became happy in proportion to her husband's advancement; she grew radiant with health; the lines of care and worry all faded out of her face; she was like a light-hearted girl, and John told her she was prettier than ever.  It was almost too good to be true, she sometimes said to herself, as she remembered the sad conditions that had prevailed while they were in Paris.  But she would not allow herself to dwell upon those unhappy experiences; the present was full of hope and promise, and she firmly believed that her husband's fame and fortune were assured.  Had John Hungerford possessed ""the stable mind,"" as Monsieur Jacques once expressed it, all must have gone well; if he had been less egotistical, selfish, and vain, more persevering and practical; had he not been naturally so indolent--""lazy,"" to quote his former teacher again--and pleasure-loving, he might have risen rapidly, and maintained his position.  But, as time wore on, and the novelty of his popularity and prosperity began to pall upon him; as the demands upon his patience became greater, and the supervision of students required more concentration and attention to detail; as the filling of increasing orders for his own work made it necessary to stick closer to his easel, day after day, life began to seem ""a grind"" again.  He grew discontented, irritable, restless.  He lost patience with his students, and became indifferent to his duty to them, until they began to be disaffected, and dropped away from him.  He neglected orders until his patrons became angry and withdrew them, and finally, becoming dissatisfied with his own work, he dropped back into his old habit of starting subject after subject, only to set them aside to try something else, rarely completing anything; all of which tended toward the ruin of his once prosperous business, as well as his reputation as an artist.  All this came about so gradually that, for a long time, no one save Helen suspected how matters were going.  She begged him to wake up and renew his efforts, both for her sake and Dorothy's, as well as for his own; and she encouraged him in every possible way.  But nothing that she could say or do served to arouse him from the mental and moral lethargy that possessed and grew upon him.  Fortunately, in spite of their recent prosperity, Helen had retained her pupils in music, more because of her love for the work than because she felt the need of money, as at first.  Thus, when her husband's income began to fall off, she dropped, little by little, into the way of sharing the household expenses from her own earnings, and so assumed burdens which he should have borne himself.  As month succeeded month, things continued to grow worse, until rumors of the truth got afloat, and his friends and patrons began to show their disapproval of his downward course, and even to shun his society.  Yet these significant omens did not serve to arouse him.  On the contrary, his indifference and indolence increased, and his old love for wandering returned; his studio would frequently be closed for days, sometimes for weeks, at a time, and only his boon companions knew where he could be found.  Helen regarded these evidences of deterioration with a sinking heart, yet tried to be patient.  She did not complain, even when their funds ran very low, but cheerfully supplied the needs of the family, and bravely tried to fortify herself with the hope that John could not long remain oblivious to his responsibilities, and would eventually retrieve himself.  During all this time she had been making splendid progress in her own musical training--especially in the cultivation of her voice.  She had often given her services in behalf of charitable entertainments, and not infrequently assisted her friends to entertain by singing a charming group of songs at parties and receptions; thus she had gained for herself the reputation of being a most pleasing vocalist.  Recently these same friends, who sympathized with her domestic trials, and, recognizing her financial difficulties, had arranged for several musical functions, asking her to superintend them, and had paid her liberally for her services.  This new departure seemed to Helen like the pointing of Providence to a more promising future, by making her entirely independent of her husband, and it would also enable her to give Dorothy advantages which she could never hope--judging from present indications--to receive from her father.  Accordingly, she immediately issued attractive cards, advertising to provide musical entertainment for clubs, receptions, or social functions of any kind.  It was somewhat late in the season when she conceived this project, and she secured only a limited number of engagements; but as she gained fresh laurels and had delighted her patrons in every instance, she believed she had paved the way for a good business by the following fall.  During the month of May of this year John began to talk of going out of town for the summer.  ""We cannot afford it,"" Helen objected.  ""My pupils will leave me in June, and will not return to me until September, and we must not spend the money it would cost for such an outing.""  ""But you need a change, as well as I, and--and some of--of Dorothy's money would be well spent in giving us all a good vacation,"" her husband argued.  ""That money is not to be touched,"" said Helen firmly.  ""That is sacredly devoted to a college course for her as soon as she leaves the high school.  Dorothy and I are perfectly well; we have more comforts at home than we could find elsewhere without paying an extravagant price, and, with a short trip now and then, to some point of interest, we can manage to be very happy without going away.""  ""We could go into the mountains, and camp out--that wouldn't cost very much,"" John persisted.  ""Camp out!"" Helen exclaimed, astonished.  ""And where would we get our meals?  You know very well that Hannah would not put up with the poor accommodations of any camp.""  ""Oh, dismiss Hannah for a couple of months!  We could get our own meals, and make them as simple as we chose,"" her husband suggested.  Helen smiled wanly.  She wondered what he meant by simple meals, for he was, as a rule, very particular what he had to eat and how it was cooked.  She realized that such a move would result in simply making her a drudge, under very uncomfortable conditions, for the summer; she would lose a good maid, and be in no way refreshed on her return to town.  ""I think it would be very unwise,"" she gravely returned; ""such an outing as that would have no rest or attraction for me; besides, I had planned to work diligently at my music during the next three months, to prepare for the winter.""  John was not at all pleased with this decided rejection of his proposition, as a protracted and sullen silence plainly indicated.  ""Well, _I_ am not willing to swelter in the hot city during the next three months, if you are,"" heat length burst forth, ""and I want a change.""  ""Oh, John, you ought to stay right here, and go to work for your family,"" said his wife, with a note of appeal in her tremulous tones. ""We have hardly money enough left to pay our bills until fall, as it is.""  ""I tell you I will not!"" he said crossly, adding: ""You can, of course, do as you choose.  If you and Dorothy will not go with me, I'll turn Bohemian, take my kit along, and make sketches for work when I return.""  Helen knew it would be useless to oppose him, so said no more.  All the same, judging from the past, she had little faith that his sketching would amount to much, and so when June opened she saw him depart with a heavy heart.  She received brief letters from him from time to time; but he told her very little of what he was doing.  His chief desire seemed to be to let her know where her letters and remittances would reach him.  He returned in September, to find his wife and child blooming and happy.  It was evident that they had enjoyed the summer far better than he, for he appeared jaded and spiritless, while he had very little to produce as material for the coming winter's work--a few rough sketches, carelessly done, were all he had to show.  Helen, however, had worked to good purpose.  Her voice was in splendid condition.  She had added several choice selections to her repertoire; while Dorothy showed marked improvement upon the piano, and had learned to accompany her mother very effectively in some of her simpler songs. But it had not been all work and no play with them.  They went out somewhere every fine day.  They had little picnics to the park; they had sails upon the bay, sometimes visiting a popular resort; and once an old friend of Helen's asked them, for a week, to her summer home, a few miles out of the city.  Dorothy was perfectly satisfied, even though most of her school friends were away, and once remarked to a friend who called upon them: ""Mamma and I do have just the nicest times together; it's great fun to go about with her.""  John had very little to say relative to his own vacation, or the companions with whom he had spent it; he certainly gave no sign of renewed vigor, and showed no inclination to take up his long-neglected painting; but Helen asked no questions, made no comments or criticisms. Neither did she manifest either surprise or disapproval when he came in one day, a month after his return, and informed her that he had given up his studio and accepted a position in his Uncle Nathan's establishment.  ""Painting pictures, as a business, is fluctuating, monotonous, unsatisfactory,"" he said.  ""He believed it would be far better to have a salary, on which he could depend.""  Helen sighed for the money that had been wasted in rent for the studio during the summer; also for the rejected art for which John possessed talent, if not genius.  But he lacked force, he hated personal responsibility, as well as work, and perhaps the salary, even though it was to be a moderate sum for the first year, would be better.  The monthly payments from Mr. Young could be relied upon, and thus her own burdens would be somewhat lightened.     CHAPTER VI.  AN OLD TEMPTATION REVIVED.  Helen had entered three new pupils on her books at the beginning of the fall, these increasing her class to thirteen, and she had also been engaged, for an early date in October, to sing at a charity fair, to be held under the auspices of one of the wealthy clubs of the city.  This seemed quite a promising outlook so early in the season, and she was also hoping much from her new venture as entertainer at private social functions.  The fair was extensively advertised, and was held for four afternoons and evenings of the second week in October, Helen appearing twice upon each occasion, and proving such a drawing card that a score of engagements for fashionable receptions was the result of her success.  This was far more than she had dared to expect, and she was much elated over her good fortune.  Everything moved along peacefully and prosperously until spring, John bearing his confinement in his uncle's office better than she had anticipated, and was apparently content with his salary.  But as the warm weather came on again she could see that he began to chafe under his confinement in the city and to his work. He had his vacation of two weeks in August, however, when he made a trip to Chicago, instead of going into the country, greatly to his wife's astonishment at the time.  On his return he seemed in high spirits, saying he had had a fine trip, and resumed his duties with apparent cheerfulness.  A week later there appeared upon the billboards about the city flaring advertisements stating that the Wells Opera Company, with beautiful Marie Duncan as star, would present the ""Prince of Pilsen"" early in October.  The newspapers also contained notices of the same fact, and stated that Miss Duncan had just concluded a summer engagement in Chicago, and was now resting for a few weeks before taking up her work in San Francisco.  At once Helen understood John's motive in going to Chicago to spend his vacation; also his unusual cheerfulness upon his return; and a foreboding of impending trouble began to haunt her from that moment.  When the Wells Opera Company arrived, Helen made it a point to attend a matinee, to ascertain for herself what the personality of the popular favorite was like.  That she was exceedingly beautiful and peculiarly fascinating there was no denying, and her voice was a marvel of sweetness.  John had never painted anything more true to life than the portrait she had discovered in his studio in Paris; although, if that were possible, the siren's charms were riper and even more alluring than at that time.  Nevertheless, there was a vein of coarseness in her manner, a boldness in her glance and smile, a voluptuous abandon in her acting, that offended and repelled Helen's finer sensibilities, and sent her home sick at heart, with mingled fear and jealousy; for, down deep in her consciousness, she was forced to acknowledge that it was just these elements in Marie Duncan that appealed to something of the same nature in her husband's character, and was winning him from his allegiance to his wife.  She wondered what had become of that portrait.  She had never seen it since that never-to-be-forgotten day when she had visited Monsieur Jacques in such distress, to seek some explanation of John's prolonged absence from home.  John certainly had not brought it back to America with him.  Whither had it disappeared?  Had he destroyed it, fearing it might some time betray him?  Suddenly her outraged heart awoke to the truth, and her face flamed hotly with indignation and humiliation as she recalled the reproduction she had seen in the magazine she had found under John's pillow in his berth on the steamer, as they were returning from France.  John had finished his picture; he had given it to the actress before she sailed for Australia, and she had allowed it to be copied by the press.  It seemed to Helen that her cup of woe was filled to the brim--her endurance taxed to the limit, as she began to query within herself what would be the outcome of Marie Duncan's present engagement in San Francisco.  But the courage that is born in heroes had also been planted in Helen Hungerford's heart, and, after the first shock of dismay had passed, she began to ask what she could do to counteract Marie's influence and keep her husband loyal to her and true to himself.  To reveal her suspicions, to voice complaints, criticisms, or reproaches would only serve to make matters worse; for John was one who would never bear censure or opposition in any form.  Her only hope lay in being tactful and diplomatic, in trying to make herself and their home so attractive that he would be weaned from his infatuation for the opera star, and realize the folly of ruining his reputation and domestic peace.  So she bravely resolved to conceal every evidence of anxiety.  John was in absolute ignorance of the fact that she even dreamed of his interest in the actress, and she realized the wisdom of still concealing it from him.  She said nothing of her afternoon at the matinee; she never referred to the opera, or expressed a desire to see it; neither did her husband invite her to go, as was usual whenever anything new, of a musical nature, was running; but she began a systematic course of acting herself, using every possible device to keep him with his family, catering to his tastes and humoring his lightest wish or whim. She asked him to be her escort to and from the social functions at which she was entertaining; she planned pleasures that would include them all, and tried to interest him in books she was reading.  But all was of no avail.  He always had some plausible excuse to get away from home evenings, and often did not return until the small hours of the morning; he manifested less and less interest in his family; he was morose and preoccupied, avoiding conversation, and at times was exceedingly irritable with Dorothy.  Previous to this, since he had been in his uncle's employ, he had cheerfully contributed a part of his salary to help defray household expenses; but now he suddenly began to withhold his money, or, if reminded that funds were needed, doled out a mere pittance so grudgingly that Helen shrank from the humiliation of asking assistance and being so inconsiderately treated.  This state of things continued far into the winter, the breach between the man and his family continually widening, for Dorothy was beginning to take notice, while he began to be irregular at his business and to show the effect of late hours and dissipation.  One afternoon, on returning from an engagement at an out-of-town reception, Helen found, to her great surprise, Mr. Nathan Young, John's uncle and employer, awaiting her.  It was the first time she had seen him for many months, for, aside from his one act of giving her husband his present position, he had never manifested the slightest interest in the family.  He was rated a very rich man, but, having a fashionable wife and four daughters to maintain, he was wholly absorbed in his business and individual responsibilities.  Helen had never been asked to entertain at any of Madam Young's receptions, although she had sent her, early in the season, a card announcing her intentions; neither had she ever met any of the family in the homes of her patrons; and now, when, after greeting her visitor with graceful courtesy, she threw aside her wrap and stood before him in her fresh young beauty and charming costume, the man stared at her in astonishment.  ""Really, Mrs. John Hungerford, you look like the wife of a millionaire,"" he brusquely observed, a note of keen irony in his tones.  Helen flushed consciously.  She realized that she must appear extravagantly attired to one who did not understand the situation.  The next moment she smiled frankly up into her companion's face.  ""Perhaps you do not know, Mr. Young, that, for two years, I have been singing at social functions given by fashionable people, to help John meet the expenses of the family?"" she explained.  ""No, I didn't know it,"" he curtly returned, his shrewd eyes still studying her costume.  ""Of course,"" Helen went on, ""going before such audiences, I am obliged to dress well; but""--with an air of quiet dignity, for she felt that the man was rude to her--""as I earn all my own clothes, as well as Dorothy's, I am wronging no one.""  ""Humph!"" Nathan Young grunted, although his glance softened; for truly Helen was very pleasant to look upon as she stood before him in her trailing gown of soft blue silk, tastefully trimmed with real lace that had belonged to her mother; she also wore some fine jewels which had come to her from the same source, and the man, now that he comprehended, secretly liked her spirit and frankness in telling him just how matters stood.  She showed a turn for business that pleased him, and he chuckled within himself over her statement that she earned all her own and Dorothy's clothes.  Money getting had been his one aim from his youth up; he liked to see people work hard for money; he had no patience with drones.  He had always viewed John's idiotic dabbling in paints with undisguised contempt, and had never shown the least interest in his career as an artist.  Presently he broke forth, almost sharply:  ""Where is that husband of yours?""  ""John?  Hasn't he been at the office to-day?"" Helen inquired, in a startled tone.  ""I've seen nothing of him for nearly a week,"" the gentleman replied, with a frown of displeasure.  ""You have not seen John for nearly a week!"" repeated the astonished wife, aghast.  ""That is what I said,"" was the curt rejoinder.  ""And this isn't the first time he has neglected his business, by any means, though he has never stayed away so long before.  I'm tired of his shilly-shallying, and he has always worked with an air of protest, as if he felt the position beneath him.  I just dropped in to see if he were ill, or had any good reason to offer for his absence.""  ""No, John is perfectly well, and I am amazed at what you have told me, Mr. Young,"" Helen observed, with tremulous lips, her composure sadly shaken.  The man arose, an ominous gleam in his eyes.  ""Well, then, you can tell him from me that he need not show up at the office again,"" he coldly observed, at the same time laying an envelope on the table before Helen.  ""Here is his pay up to the end of the month.  He hasn't earned it, but it's what I agreed to give him, and I'm a man of my word.  I hoped,"" he continued, less sharply, after a momentary pause, during which his glance fell upon his companion's colorless face, ""when he came to me for a position he had given up his nonsense about art, and had made up his mind to settle down to something worth while, and I meant to do well by him--take him in with me, by and by, perhaps, if he showed any backbone or interest in the business; but it is evident that he cares more for his own ease and pleasure than for anything else, and--I'm through with him.""  Helen's heart sank within her.  She dare not think what might be the consequences if John lost his position just at this time.  It would leave him with no responsibility, and with nothing to do but to dance attendance upon Marie Duncan.  She felt it would mean utter ruin for their domestic happiness.  He might not mend his ways even if his uncle retained him in his service, since his infatuation for the actress had become so strong; but it would at least be something to hold him from spending all his time with her.  To be suddenly cut off like this seemed like the parting asunder of the cable that held their only anchor of hope, thus leaving them drifting helplessly upon a treacherous sea.  ""Oh, pray do not say that, Mr. Young!"" she pleaded, with whitening lips.  ""John needs to be encouraged, to be held by some responsibility. Will you not kindly give him another trial?""  ""No, I have borne all I shall from him,"" gruffly replied Nathan Young, but shifting uneasily under the look in her imploring eyes.  ""John has no sense of responsibility, no idea of duty in connection with himself or any one else.  His only thought is to drift comfortably with the current; when there is any rowing to be done he thrusts it upon some one else every time.  I've been studying him ever since he came to me, and I know.  He will never be 'held,' as you put it, except by his own will--at least, until he has had some lesson in life that will make a stronger impression upon him than any he has had yet.  There, I've had my say!  It has taken me longer to make up my mind to this, perhaps, than you have any idea, for he was my sister's boy, and I owed her something; but when I finally come to a decision about anything the matter is settled.  I am sorry for you, though, Mrs. Hungerford--upon my word, I am.  I don't believe it has been easy navigating for you, in spite of the brave front you show to the world,"" he concluded, with a touch of honest sympathy, while he wondered if she had any suspicion of how or where her husband was spending the most of his time.  He had been investigating the movements of his recreant nephew of late, and he had learned that his companions and pursuits were not at all to his credit.  Helen stood cold and haughty before him.  She was stung to the quick by the man's harsh arraignment and curt dismissal of her husband; yet she knew, in her heart, that he was justified in both.  At the same time, John was her husband, and the father of her child, and she was bound to defend him--to be loyal to him as long as defense and loyalty were possible.  She saw that it was useless to expect any concession from Mr. Young, that it would be a waste of time and energy to argue with him.  So she braced herself to meet the inevitable with what composure she could command, and observed, with an air of quiet dignity:  ""I will give Mr. Hungerford your message, Mr. Young.  I deeply regret that you have been so disappointed in your expectations regarding him. I feel confident, however, that there is good in him,"" she went on, with wifely fealty; ""that some time it will be developed, and that he will win for himself a place and a name in the world.  I trust Madam Young and the young ladies are well?"" she graciously concluded, as she saw that her visitor was becoming restive and anxious to terminate the interview.  ""Thank you; they are in their usual health,"" he replied, eagerly seizing the opportunity she had so gracefully made for him, and his hat at the same time.  Helen followed him to the door, where she bade him a courteous ""good afternoon;"" then, as he passed from her presence, she sank, strengthless, upon a chair, looking the picture of despair.  ""Truly my burden is becoming heavier than I can bear,"" she moaned, in bitterness of spirit.     CHAPTER VII.  SERIOUS DOMESTIC COMPLICATIONS.  When John Hungerford returned to his home and learned of his summary dismissal from his uncle's employ, instead of appearing disturbed by the unexpected information, he manifested undisguised relief and satisfaction.  ""Thank the propitious Fates!  So the old crank has given me the grand bounce, has he?"" he exclaimed, with sneering levity.  ""'_Propitious_ Fates!'"" repeated Helen, with grave disapproval.  ""I regard it as a great misfortune.  Pray, what do you intend to do for a living in the future, John?""  ""Oh, I'll look about and see what I can find--I reckon something will turn up,"" he returned, with an air of indifference that smote his wife keenly.  Whether he ""looked about,"" or made any effort to obtain a position, Helen had no means of knowing.  But weeks passed, and he was still idle, having done absolutely nothing during that time for the provision of his family.  He was sullen and disagreeable when at home, and resented all inquiries regarding his movements.  Thus the husband and wife could only drift farther and farther apart; for Helen was becoming both discouraged and indignant in view of John's increasing apathy and neglect, which seemed to imply that he felt no personal responsibility and experienced no moral discomfort in allowing her to supply all the needs of the household indefinitely.  Dorothy was now fourteen years of age, a very bright, attractive girl. She was keenly observant of what was going on around her, and, as she not infrequently was a sufferer from the inharmony pervading her home, she was beginning to realize that something was very wrong between her father and mother.  Helen, however, never encouraged either comments or questions from her, and always evaded any reference to the strained relations between her husband and herself.  But matters continued to grow worse, and were finally brought to a climax one day when Dorothy burst in upon her, on returning from school, in a state of great excitement, her face crimson from shame, her eyes flashing with anger.  ""Mamma, what _will_ you say?"" she passionately exclaimed.  ""I saw papa, just now, riding in an auto with Marie Duncan, that opera singer who has been singing at the Grand Theater all winter.  They were laughing, and joking, and having a great time together.  Grace Winthrop was with me, and I was so mortified I thought I'd die!""  Helen Hungerford lifted an ashen face to the speaker.  ""Dorothy, are you _sure_?"" she gasped, the startled throbbing of her heart making her voice almost inaudible.  ""Of course I am sure!"" was the positive reply.  ""There were so many teams in the street the auto had to slow down as it passed the car we were in, and papa saw us, and got awful red in the face.  He nodded to us, but I just looked him straight back in the eye--I wouldn't notice him.  Mamma, what makes him do such horrid things?  Why can't he be nice, like other gentlemen?  Oh, I am so ashamed!  What will Grace think?  What will everybody think?"" she concluded wildly.  ""Hush, Dorrie, dear; it can do no good to get so excited over it,"" said Helen, her own lips quivering painfully as she folded the trembling girl in her arms and kissed her tenderly.  Dorothy convulsively returned her embrace; then threw herself in a torrent of tears upon the couch beside which her mother had been sitting when she came in.  Helen allowed her to weep unrestrained, believing that the storm would soonest spend itself in that way.  She sat beside her, white-faced, heavy-hearted, and tried to confront the situation.  John, openly riding, in broad daylight, through the streets of the city, with the opera star, betrayed a wantonness that defied all conventionality or decorum.  It was an evidence of indifference to public opinion, to his own respectability, and to the notoriety that must reflect upon his family, which showed how thoroughly infatuated he had become.  And in an automobile!  Whose car was it?  Did it belong to the actress, or was John guilty of the extravagance of hiring it to take the woman about?  If so, where did he get the money to pay for it, when he was not supplying a dollar toward his own support or that of his family?  When John Hungerford entered his home that night, late as it was, he found a wan-faced, hollow-eyed woman sitting up for him; yet, despite the serpent sting in her heart, busy at work upon the week's mending.  ""Well,"" he observed, in a half-jocose, half-defiant tone, although a flush of shame swept his face as he met his wife's sad eyes, ""I suppose the kid told you?""  ""Yes, Dorothy has told me where, and with whom, she saw you this afternoon.  John, what does it mean?"" Helen gravely returned.  Her manner, as well as his own accusing conscience, angered him, and he swore--another evidence of his degeneration, for, as a rule, he had been a gentleman, rarely allowing himself to use either profane or vulgar language.  He had been deeply chagrined, that afternoon, on coming almost face to face with Dorothy and her friend, the daughter of one of San Francisco's highly respected citizens.  He had known, of course, that Dorothy would tell her mother, which nettled him still more, and now to be arraigned by Helen, to have her presume to dictate terms to him, as he felt she would do, caused him to lose all control of himself.  ""I don't know that I am accountable to you for where I go, or with whom I spend my time,"" he sullenly replied.  Helen sat erect, her own spirit now thoroughly aroused.  ""Yes, you _are_ accountable to me when you compromise the honor of your family--and in the presence of your own child,"" she said, her blazing eyes looking straight into his; then she added, with quiet but convincing firmness: ""And the way we have been living of late cannot go on any longer.""  He regarded her with mingled surprise and inquiry.  Had the worm turned at last?  Had his gentle, loyal, patient wife reached the limit of her endurance?  Would she--did she mean that she would leave him?  It had never occurred to him that she would take such a stand as this.  ""What do you mean, Helen?"" he demanded, with compressed lips.  ""I mean that you are making my life intolerable--my burdens are heavier than I can bear.""  ""You are jealous of Marie Duncan?"" he said, a slight smile curling his lips.  ""Jealous--of _her_?  _No!_"" cried Helen scornfully.  ""A woman who will accept the exclusive attentions of a married man, allowing him to lavish upon her money that is needed by and rightly belongs to his family, is worthy only of contempt.  But I _am_ concerned for my own good name and yours, for the future of my child, that no taint shall mar her prospects and sap the joy from her life.  So I say this state of things must _stop_.""  ""Very well; let it stop, then!"" John flung back angrily.  ""Do you want a divorce?""  ""A divorce!  _I?_"" cried Helen, scarce able to restrain a shriek of aversion at the suggestion.  Then, swallowing hard, she panted: ""I could not be divorced.""  ""You are mistaken; the law will free you if you desire.""  ""The _law_!  It is an unholy law, made to accommodate vacillating natures that lightly wed to-day and weary of their bonds to-morrow; it is a blot and a shame upon the constitution that permits it, upon the country that tolerates it.  No, no--it is not possible for me!""  She sat silent for a moment or two, her companion studying her uneasily meanwhile.  ""John,"" she presently resumed, bending nearer to him, and he could see the pulses beating in her white throat from the intensity of her emotion, ""when I married you it was no light thing I did.  I gave _myself_ to you--all that I was then, or ever hoped to be in this life--until death should part us--_death_, do you understand?--not until you should become weary of me, or until I found my burdens heavier than I had thought, but for better or for worse, as long as time should endure for us.  It was a vow that can never be annulled--a hundred divorces would avail nothing; I marvel that you could suggest the measure to me!  I am your wife, united to you not only by that solemn ceremony that made us one, but by an indissoluble bond that involves my honor, my love, and my loyalty--by that moral law that never releases one from his voluntary oath--and your wife I shall remain as long as I draw breath.""  John Hungerford's face had changed many times from crimson to white as he sat spellbound while his wife poured forth this passionate revelation of her inmost self to him.  ""Do you mean that you would not, _under any circumstances_, seek a divorce from me?"" he inquired, shifting uneasily in his chair, when she ceased.  ""Yes, that is what I mean.""  ""Suppose--that I should seek a divorce for myself?""  Helen's hand clenched spasmodically within the sock she had been mending.  ""I should still hold myself bound by my vows to you,"" she said, with white lips.  The man shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably.  ""Just what did you mean by saying that things cannot go on any longer as they are going with us now?"" he questioned.  ""I meant that it devolves upon you to assume your share of the burden of providing for your family; that I will not support you in idleness any longer.""  This was surely straightforward speaking, and John regarded his wife curiously for a moment.  Hitherto she had been so patient and yielding he had not believed her capable of taking such a stand.  ""Well, if you wish to be rid of me, I suppose I can relieve you of my presence.""  ""Where will you go?  How will you live?""  ""Oh, I suppose 'the wind will be tempered to the shorn lamb,'"" he quoted, with mocking irreverence.  Helen sprang to her feet, and faced him with flaming eyes.  She felt disgusted with and outraged by his utter indifference to her long-suffering patience under many trials, and by his deplorable lack of manliness.  ""John Hungerford, where is your manhood?"" she demanded, with cold scorn.  ""Where your respect for your wife, or your love for your child? Do you not even possess _self_-respect?""  ""I warn you not to push me too far,"" he retorted hotly, adding: ""Perhaps you really want me to get out--do you?"" and he leaned toward her, with a menacing look and air.  ""No, for your own sake, I do not wish you to do that; but I do want you to show yourself a man, and some recognition of your duty as a husband and father,"" Helen spiritedly replied.  Then she dauntlessly continued: ""But I tell you again we cannot live this way any longer.""  ""'Duty!'  'Duty!'  That is always a woman's fling at a man, even if he is down on his luck.  I'm not at all fond of this nagging, and I believe, on the whole, we'd be better off apart,"" he angrily shot back at her.  For a full minute Helen silently searched his face.  It was flushed, sullen, dogged.  Was he really weary of the ties that bound him?  Was he tired of her and of Dorothy?  Was he seeking an excuse to get out, hoping to rid himself thereby of his moral responsibility, and be free to indulge his admiration for the fascinating soubrette?  She was forced to believe that he was--everything seemed to point to that end, and it was evident that he had no intention of yielding to her terms; he would assume no responsibilities that were irksome to him; no burdens to cumber him; and suddenly all her outraged womanhood, wifehood, motherhood were aroused to arms, overleaping the last point of endurance.  She drew herself to her full height, and confronted him with a spirit he had never seen her manifest before.  ""_As--you--please!_"" she said, with freezing deliberation; and, pulling from her hand the silken sock she had been mending for him when he came in, she tossed it upon the floor at his feet.  She held his eye for another brief moment, and he cringed visibly beneath the contemptuous renunciation that he read in the look.  The next he was alone.  Helen had fled to her chamber, where she fell, half fainting, upon her bed, her heart broken, her spirit crushed.  A little later she heard the outer door close with a bang, and knew that her husband had left the house.  Would he ever return?  Would she really care if he never returned?  Her burdens and trials had been very heavy and perplexing during most of her married life.  She had tried to be brave, loyal, and self-sacrificing; she had laid her all upon the altar of her love for this man, only to have her unceasing immolation ignored, as of no special value, except in so far as it had relieved him of care, clothed, fed, and sheltered him.  Now the last straw had been laid upon her by his shameless devotion to a brazen actress, regardless of the taint upon his own reputation and the scandal it must entail upon his family.  It seemed, as she lay there, half conscious, as if this blow had crushed every atom of affection for him out of her heart, and she began to feel that, as far as she was concerned, it might be a blessed release to be free from him forever.  Yet for his own and Dorothy's sake, she would have continued to bear her cross indefinitely and without a murmur, to save him from sin and to shield her child from the disgrace that now threatened them all.  Days passed and lengthened into weeks, during which she did not once see or hear from her husband; but one afternoon, upon returning from an engagement out of town, she found that he had been in the house and removed all of his personal belongings, together with the choicest of his paintings and some rare curios which he had collected during their honeymoon abroad.  This act convinced her that he intended their separation to be final.  She had told Dorothy something of the recent stormy interview between her husband and herself, because she believed it best to prepare her for what she feared might be the outcome of it before very long.  During the earlier portion of her brief life Dorothy had been very fond of her father, and he had always manifested a strong affection for her; but during the last two years Helen had observed that the girl often avoided him, that she grieved over his growing indifference to his obligations and his home; while not infrequently she had openly resented his treatment of her mother.  When Helen told her she thought it probable that her father would leave them altogether, the girl sat in silent thought for several minutes. Then she lifted adoring eyes to her mother's face.  ""Mamma, if he _wants_ to go away from such a lovely wife as you have been, because he--he likes that coarse, loud-talking woman I saw him with that day, I--I'd just _let_ him go, and--and be glad to have him away,"" she said, her face growing crimson, her eyes flashing resentment in view of her father's wrongdoing.  ""But, Dorrie, dear, he is your father, and----""  ""My _father_!  He hasn't acted much like a father who cared anything for his daughter!"" Dorothy indignantly interposed.  ""And he's been horrid to _you_, lots of times.  He's been so _lazy_, too, lounging around the house and letting you work so hard, and taking your _money_. I've been so ashamed that he couldn't be like other gentlemen, and take care of _us_.  I used to think I was proud of him, and loved him, for he _is_ handsome and can be nice when he feels like it.  I--I don't like to go near him now, though, and I haven't wanted to kiss him for a long time.  But I love _you_, mamma, dear, with all my heart; and if he does go away I will try to be so good to you that--that perhaps you won't mind it quite so much,"" the child concluded, with a burst of tears, as she threw herself into her mother's arms, and clung to her convulsively.  Helen was deeply touched by this spontaneous outburst of love and loyalty, and, as she thought the matter over more and more, she began to feel that if John's infatuation could not be broken--if he was past redemption--it would be better for Dorothy, perhaps, to be away from his influence.  A month later Helen received notice from a lawyer, informing her of her husband's intention of applying for a divorce; he also stated that Mr. Hungerford desired a personal interview for the purpose of definitely arranging the matter with her.  Helen acceded to this request, and the scene recorded in our opening chapter followed a few days later, when John Hungerford learned, much to his surprise, that his wife would oppose no obstacle to his desire and efforts to secure a legal separation from her; when she had told him he might go free, as soon as the law would allow, provided he would relinquish all claim to Dorothy and did not attempt to compromise herself in any way.  The result we already know.  The divorce was granted.  John Hungerford went immediately abroad, ostensibly to resume his art studies, but really to follow the woman who had won his allegiance from his wife, and Helen was left to meet the situation alone as best she could.     CHAPTER VIII.  HELEN PLANS HER FUTURE.  ""I have decided to leave San Francisco.  I will not have Dorothy's life spoiled by this wretched scandal, which she will never be allowed to forget if we remain here.  I am going to put three thousand miles between our past history and ourselves.  I am going to New York City to live.""  Thus announced Helen Hungerford while discussing her future with her lifelong friend, Mrs. Horace Hamilton, who had been not only her chum throughout their college course, and her maid of honor at her marriage, but had faithfully stood by her in all her trials since her return from Europe.  It was she who had helped her to secure music scholars, who had been first and foremost in introducing her as a chamber-concert singer, and launching her upon the career that had proved such a signal success.  She had also been especially kind and loyal at the time of her husband's desertion, and shielded her in every possible way from the gossip and scandal attending the unfortunate separation.  ""Mercy, dear, won't it be flying in the face of Providence for you to race wildly off to the other side of the continent?"" exclaimed Mrs. Hamilton, in a startled tone, adding sympathetically: ""I am forced to admit that your position here is certainly very trying, Helen; but this seems to me like a perfectly mad scheme.  Do you know a single soul in New York?""  ""No, I do not; and that is just the reason why I am going there.""  ""But you are so well established, and have so many stanch friends here; the sympathies of every one who knows you and the trials you have had to encounter are with you,"" objected her companion.  ""I know that; everybody has been heavenly kind to me, and I fully appreciate it,"" said Helen, with starting tears.  ""But I don't want _sympathy_--I simply want to forget; and I will not have Dorothy weighed down with pity, and all the brightness and hope crushed out of her life,"" she concluded passionately, and flushing with hot resentment against her hard lot.  ""But I am afraid you will have an awfully hard struggle all alone in New York,"" said her friend, looking deeply troubled.  ""And yet--I don't know""--her face clearing suddenly--""Lena Jerome, Horace's sister, is prominent in society there.  She is a dear, and would do anything to help a friend of ours.  You certainly are a fine music teacher, Helen--you make all your pupils love you, and I believe that is one secret of your success; and you sing divinely at drawing-room functions.  Lena would be just the one to aid you in securing the right kind of scholars, and to secure for you the entre to society for entertaining, as you have done here.  After all, I do believe it will be the very best thing for you to do, if--if the expense of such a change will not be too much for you,"" Mrs. Hamilton concluded, with some embarrassment, for she believed that John Hungerford had left his wife absolutely penniless.  ""I have saved some money from my own earnings,"" Helen explained.  ""It has been uphill work since John gave up business, but I have never allowed myself to spend every dollar of my income; I have managed to put away something every month--'an emergency nest egg,' I have called it.  Then, the little my father left me I have sacredly hoarded to defray the expense of a college course for Dorothy; so I am sure I can manage very well, even in New York, until I can secure pupils and engagements.  I shall be very grateful to Mr. Hamilton's sister if she will take me under her friendly wing for a little while, until I become established.  Belle, what should I have done without you?  You have been my sheet anchor in this heartbreaking storm.""  She reached out, clasped her friend's hand, and laid it against her lips, as she ceased speaking.  Mrs. Hamilton slipped an affectionate arm about her waist, and drew her close, hot tears of rebellion welling to her eyes as she recalled the evening of Helen's brilliant wedding, when they had stood side by side beneath the great arch of white roses in the Appletons' lovely home, and contrasted the seemingly bright outlook of that occasion with her present blighted hopes and broken heart.  ""Well, you know it was always 'you and I together, love,' in the old days at college--one never had a pleasure or a trouble that the other did not share, and I am sure we love each other as well to-day, if not better, than we did then,"" she fondly replied; then added, with cheerful animation: ""Now, let me tell you that your plan appeals to me more and more.  I can see that you and Dorothy will escape a great deal of depressing and exasperating scandal by this change; thus, as you have said, the dear child's future will not be marred by continual reminders of the unhappy experiences of the last few years.  You have brought her up admirably thus far, Helen--she gives promise of becoming a beautiful and talented woman; and I believe when we have you well settled in New York you will both be happier than you have been for a long time.""  ""What a blessing it is to have a loyal friend!"" breathed Helen gratefully.  ""You have cheered me more than I can tell you, and, with your assurance of Mrs. Jerome's influence to help me in my future career, my courage is greatly strengthened.  I--I shall ask you to introduce us to her as--Mrs. and Miss Dorothy _Ford_,"" she concluded, with some hesitation, as she searched her friend's face to see how she would receive this suggestion.  ""That is another plan of which I heartily approve,"" returned Mrs. Hamilton, with unfeigned satisfaction.  ""Put away from you--_forget_--all that is possible pertaining to the sad past, and take a new lease of life and happiness.  But for Dorothy, I would have advised that you resume your maiden name.  'Ford' will do very nicely, though.  A new name may have the effect of strengthening your feeling of independence, and will not expose you to inquiries concerning John Hungerford.  Now, dear heart, I must go straight home--it is almost dinner time, and I am eager to tell Horace of your plan for the future. I feel sure that he also will think well of it.  I will send the car around for you and Dorrie to come and dine with us to-morrow night, and we will all talk it over together more at length.""  Mr. Hamilton, who was a wise counselor, did think well of Helen's contemplated change of residence, and as he advised her to get away as early as practicable from all unpleasant reminders, she began at once to prepare for her departure.  She disposed of all her household furniture, knowing it would be very expensive and troublesome to move it across the continent; and, as she still had some fine old pieces that had been in her family for many years, she realized from this sale a snug sum, that would go far toward furnishing her new home upon reaching her destination.  This involved much care and labor, and she found her fortitude and strength were well-nigh spent when all was over, and her once pretty apartment shorn of all that had once made it an attractive home.  The Hamiltons had insisted upon having Dorothy and herself spend a week with them and have a good rest before leaving for New York, and Helen had deferred until this time a few errands and small matters of business that remained to be attended to.  One of these was the withdrawal of Dorothy's money from the institutions where it had been deposited.  But when she opened her treasure box, where she had always kept important papers, her mother's jewelry, and other choice mementoes, the bank books were not to be found.  She could not believe the evidence of her own eyes, and searched the contents of the receptacle over and over, with, alas! the same result.  With a sinking heart, she flew to the bank officials, to make inquiries, only to be told, with evident surprise, in view of her ignorance of the fact, that Mr. Hungerford had, as Dorothy's legal guardian, closed the accounts some three months previous.  This terrible and unlooked-for blow was the overflowing drop in Helen's cup of woe, and for the first time in her life she was utterly prostrated, the shock resulting in a serious illness that kept her in bed for three miserable weeks.  Once again faithful Belle Hamilton and her good husband proved the unfailing loyalty of their friendship.  The pleasantest room in their beautiful home was assigned to the suffering woman; the family physician and a good nurse were drafted into her service, and nothing spared that would contribute to her comfort and restoration.  But Helen was not only physically exhausted; she was also heartsick and weary of the struggle to live, and, for a time, it seemed doubtful which way the tide would turn.  But her motherhood was her salvation, and the crisis was at length safely passed.  ""If it were not for Dorrie, I would gladly give up the battle,"" she said weakly to her friend one day, when she was beginning to convalesce, yet with her strength at a very low ebb.  ""If--if I _have_ to leave her, Belle, I know you will still be a good friend to her, as you have been to me.""  ""Next to Horace and you, Dorrie is my best beloved, and I have no children of my own.  I do not need to say more, Helen,"" returned Mrs. Hamilton, her composure sadly shaken.  ""But, dearie,"" she added cheerily, as she fondly stroked the brown head upon the pillow, ""you will not have to leave her.  Doctor Allen told Horace yesterday that you are coming out all right, and I beg you will not allow yourself to think anything else, for Dorrie needs her _mother_; no one else can do for her what you can do.  Now, Helen,"" she went on, with grave authority, ""you simply _must_ put out of your consciousness every desponding thought, for your own sake, as well as ours.  Don't worry about money, or how you are going to manage when you get to New York; everything will be taken care of for you until you can take care of yourself, and I know if you will only call back your courage, take a fresh grip on hope, and do your best to get well, you will ultimately conquer every adverse circumstance, and you and Dorothy will yet have a beautiful and happy life together.""  This sensible advice, together with the love and cheerful atmosphere surrounding her, was very helpful to the invalid, and she improved more rapidly from that time.  She _had_ ""worried about money"" and what would be the outcome of her overwhelming misfortune, for, with what little she had left, she knew it would be impossible to defray the expenses of the journey to and make a home upon her arrival in New York.  It had almost seemed as if she were fated to remain in San Francisco and meekly take up again the work she had just relinquished, even though Dorothy's whole future might be marred thereby.  But her friend's reassuring talk had put new heart into her, and she immediately began to plan her work for the coming winter.  By another week she was able to be up and dressed, and, with her physician's sanction, the day of her departure was set seven days later.  One evening, on coming home to dinner, Mr. Hamilton informed his wife, after they were all seated at the table, that important business called him to New York, and, with the time it would take going and returning, he would probably be absent from home nearly a month.  He concluded by inquiring, in a matter-of-fact tone:  ""How would you like to come with me, Belle, and make that long-promised visit to Lena?""  ""How delightful!  I should like it exceedingly,"" replied Mrs. Hamilton, lifting a searching look to her husband's face.  This was the first she had heard about ""business in New York,"" and she had a strong suspicion that some other motive had prompted this sudden trip.  A twinkle shot into the gentleman's eyes as they met her own, which quickly suffused with tears as she realized that this plan was simply a ruse to protect and support Helen throughout her long journey and see her comfortably settled in her new home upon the far side of the continent.  Mr. Hamilton hastened to her rescue, for he saw that she was very near losing her composure and spoiling everything.  ""We haven't had a real outing together, dear, for a long time,"" he smilingly observed; ""and when Mr. Ashley told me this morning he thought we'd better send some one to New York and Washington to look into some complications that have arisen in connection with our new patents, I told him I would be glad to go myself.  I thought it would be very pleasant for you and me to bear our departing friends company on their long journey--oh, Dorrie, what do you think of it?"" he concluded, turning to the girl, who always sat at his right hand at table--a privilege she greatly appreciated.  ""Oh, Uncle Horace, I think it will be just--_grand_!"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands for joy.  ""It won't seem _quite_ so much like going away from you and Aunt Belle altogether.""  He reached out a shapely hand and patted her softly on the shoulder, a suspicion of tears in his own eyes, for the child had greatly endeared herself to him during her stay in the house.  ""Well, then, Belle, dear, if you can get your grip packed by Monday morning, I will be ready to act as escort for the party to the great and terrible city of Gotham.""  ""Grip, indeed!"" exclaimed his wife, in mock indignation, but giving him a roguish look.  ""I am expecting to take a trunk, containing several empty trays, with me, if you please.  Pray, did you imagine that you were going to take me to New York--the Paris of America--and bring me home again, without being well stocked with the prettiest things I could find?""  Mr. Hamilton gravely put down his knife and fork, drew forth a very flat-looking wallet, and laid it upon the table before Dorothy, with a dejected air.  ""Open it, sweetheart, and tell me if you do not think your auntie is a very unreasonable woman and your uncle a much-abused man,"" he said, in an injured tone.  Dorothy unfolded the receptacle, carefully looked it through, and brought to light a single twenty-dollar bill.  Her brows contracted in perplexity.  She studied the crisp note for a moment, then navely returned:  ""Why, Uncle Horace, that isn't _all_ you will have to spend in New York, is it?  I--I thought you were--were very rich!""  A burst of laughter greeted her innocent remark, at which Dorothy flushed rosily, to find a joke had been played upon her; then, quietly returning the bill to its place, she passed the wallet to Mr. Hamilton, and observed demurely:  ""I guess auntie knows what she is about, and where to find more when she wants it,"" at which a second outburst brought a dimple into her own cheeks.  ""Dorothy, I did not think that of you!  Do you know what faithful Mrs. Micawber was in the habit of saying to Mr. Micawber?"" inquired Mr. Hamilton, with an assumption of severity.  ""Yes, sir; but I don't think _Mr._ Micawber was in the habit of playing _tricks_ upon _Mrs._ Micawber,"" retorted Dorothy, the mischievous dimples deepening, while Mrs. Hamilton applauded gleefully with both hands.  ""So you are going to desert me, if I play tricks upon you!  Well, I can't afford to lose my sweetheart, so we will try to be good friends--at least until we reach New York, and I promise you auntie shall not suffer for pretty things,"" said the gentleman, bestowing a fond look upon her and a smile upon his wife.  ""Oh, Uncle Horace, I wish _you_ were going to live in New York, too,"" the girl observed wistfully.  ""If I could only have you, and Aunt Belle, and Grace Winthrop, I would be perfectly happy.""  ""You will miss Grace, but you will find nice friends wherever you go,"" said Mrs. Hamilton kindly; then the conversation turned upon plans for the coming trip.  The next few days were busy ones, and Monday morning found the party of four en route for the East; and with her good friends to bear her cheerful company Helen bade a final farewell to her ""Valley of Achor,"" and turned her face toward the rising sun, with something of hope in her heart, to begin anew the battle of life for herself and her child, in a great, unknown city.  Upon their arrival in New York, the Hamiltons helped her to find and furnish a small apartment in a good location, these faithful friends manifesting a keen enjoyment and interest in their work that was most inspiring to Helen.  It certainly was a very attractive little nest when the last touches were put to it--""a haven of rest,"" she told them, after her battle with the rough storms and winds that had wrecked her bark and left her bruised and broken upon the barren shore of despair.  Before it was time for the Hamiltons to return to San Francisco, both mother and daughter began to feel quite at home in their quiet corner of the mighty city, and to manifest a serenity, even something of happiness, that was very gratifying to these good people, who felt deeply concerned for their future.  They had been introduced to the Jeromes, who had cordially opened their hearts and home to them, and who assured Mr. Hamilton that they would do everything in their power to launch Mrs. Ford upon her career during the coming season; while Mollie Jerome, their daughter, about the same age of Dorothy, was at once greatly attracted to her new little friend.  ""Mamma, I think she is _almost_ as nice as Grace, and isn't it beautiful to have found some one to love so quickly?"" Dorothy confided to her mother one night, on her return after having been entertained all day in the elegant home of the Jeromes.  By the first of October, through the influence of Mrs. Homer Jerome, Helen had secured a number of pupils and an engagement to sing at a fashionable reception, the date of which was set for the third of November.  With this small but promising beginning, her spirits began to rise, and she found all her former energy and love for her work returning.  She was gaining rapidly in flesh and strength; the lines of care and trouble were fast fading out of her face, even though there were times when she was broken-hearted and passionately rebellious, in view of her husband's dishonor and faithlessness, and her own miserable position as a deserted wife.  Her first work, after getting settled in her little home, was to put Dorothy into a good school, after which she gave herself up for several hours of every day to systematic practice to get in good voice for her first appearance in New York society as a drawing-room artiste.     CHAPTER IX.  AFTER TEN YEARS.    The thorns I have reaped are of the tree   I planted; they have torn me and I bled;   I should have known what fruit would spring from such         a seed.  BYRON.   It is a brilliant, star-lighted night in December.  In an even more brilliantly illuminated mansion on Fifth Avenue, New York City, a distinguished company is assembled.  Elderly and middle-aged gentlemen, dignified and imposing, with the suggestion of opulence pervading every look and movement; young men, alert and full of vigor, all clad in conventional dress suits and immaculate linen; stately and beautiful matrons, elegantly robed in velvet and costly laces; younger women resplendent in all the tints of the rainbow, and flashing with diamonds and other many-hued gems; pretty dbutantes, in diaphanous and saintly white, gleaming like spotless lilies in beds of variegated poppies; flowers and perfume everywhere; entrancing melody from an invisible orchestra, mingling with many musical voices, joyous laughter, and the rustle and swish of silk and satin--all contributed to produce a wonderful scene and an exhilarating atmosphere, which assumed life to be one long, gorgeous gala day, with never a cloud to dim its brightness or cast its shadow upon these gay votaries of fashion and pleasure.  Suddenly the music of the orchestra ceased, and presently a few dominant chords were struck upon a fine-toned concert-grand piano, as if to demand attention and silence.  The next moment a woman of beautiful and gracious presence stepped upon a low platform beside the instrument, whereupon the buzzing of many voices was hushed, and an air of eager expectation pervaded the company.  The dominant chords were followed by a rippling prelude, which soon dropped into the more precise rhythm of an accompaniment; then a glorious voice, full, rich, and thrillingly sympathetic, broke upon the stillness, rising, falling, and trilling easily and naturally as a bird, that, conscious only of the supreme impulse within his throbbing breast and vibrating in his wonderful little throat, pours forth his joy-laden soul in enraptured and exquisite song.  Every eye within range of her was fastened upon the singer, a queenly matron, charmingly gowned in some soft material of pale-pink lavender. Her abundant brown hair was becomingly arranged and surmounted by a glittering aigrette of jewels, her only visible ornament.  She was good to look upon as well as to listen to, and bore herself with the ease and poise of one long accustomed to entertain fashionable audiences like the present, yet without a suggestion of self-consciousness to mar her excellent work.  She rendered a group of three classical songs with artistic effect that won for her a round of hearty applause as she ceased.  She gracefully acknowledged the tribute paid her, then turned and smilingly nodded to some one who had evidently been sitting near her.  Immediately a lovely girl, robed in white, arose, and took her stand at the left of the artiste.  A flutter of excitement throughout the room indicated the anticipation of some unusual treat as harp, violin, and cello, accompanied by the piano, rendered an inspiring introduction, which was followed by a familiar duet from one of the standard operas, and executed with an exquisite interpretation and spirit that held every listener spellbound to the end, and evoked a storm of enthusiastic approval upon its conclusion.  ""Jove! can't they sing!  Who are they, Jerome?  Sisters, I should judge, by their strong resemblance to each other, and the younger is simply adorable!""  Mr. Homer Jerome, the host of the evening, smiled, his fine eyes twinkling with secret satisfaction at these flattering compliments bestowed upon the protges of his wife by the aristocratic and fastidious Clifford Alexander, the son of an old college chum, who had recently returned from several years' sojourn in Europe.  ""The elder lady is Madam Ford, who has become quite noted in New York during the last ten years as a drawing-room artiste.  She is in great demand among society people, and never fails to give satisfaction to an appreciative audience.  Her companion is Miss Dorothy Ford, madam's daughter,"" Mr. Jerome explained.  ""You don't mean to tell me that the lady in lavender is the mother of the other!  It doesn't seem possible!"" exclaimed the first speaker, astonished.  ""I am sure Madam Ford would appreciate the flattering, though indirect, compliment you have paid her, my boy,"" observed his host, with a genial laugh.  ""Madam is certainly a very youthful-looking woman, considering her age and checkered experiences, for, some years ago, she was left penniless to battle, single-handed, with the world, and she has seen much trouble.""  ""She is a widow, then?""  ""Um--er--I think it was about ten years ago that she lost her husband,"" was Mr. Jerome's somewhat noncommittal reply; then he hastened to add: ""But she faced the situation with indomitable courage and energy, and, possessing much native talent, a beautiful voice, and a charming personality, she has achieved a brilliant career for herself.""  ""Evidently she has found a very warm friend in Mr. Homer Jerome, to whom, perhaps, she may owe something of her success in life,"" observed Mr. Alexander, to whom his host's generous-spirited philanthropy was no secret.  ""I esteem it an honor to be numbered among Madam Ford's friends,"" heartily returned Mr. Jerome.  ""She was really a protge of my wife's, to begin with, and we have seen a good deal of her during the ten years of our acquaintance--first, to admire her for her heroism and perseverance under difficulties, and later to love her for herself. The daughter is no less lovely than her mother,"" the gentleman continued, his eyes lingering fondly upon the girl.  ""Madam has given her every possible advantage, and when she discovered that she also possessed a promising voice she placed her under one of our finest teachers, here in New York, with what result you have just had the pleasure of ascertaining.""  ""She is surely deserving of laurels for this evening's work,"" said the young man appreciatively.  ""Particularly as this is her first appearance in a professional rle. Her voice is powerful, rich, and sympathetic.  I would not be surprised if Miss Dorothy eventually outclasses her mother as an artist.""  And Mr. Jerome beamed satisfaction upon his favorite as he concluded.  ""Dorothy Ford,"" mused Clifford Alexander, his voice lingering upon the name while his fine eyes studied the face of the beautiful girl, who was now chatting socially with a group of people who were offering hearty congratulations to both mother and daughter.  ""It is a peculiarly euphonious name for a very attractive young woman. Introduce me, will you, Jerome?""  ""With the greatest pleasure,"" responded that gentleman, with a sly smile; and a few minutes later Mr. Alexander was making his best bow before Madam Ford, whom he found even more charming at close range than at a distance; and then the usually imperturbable young man found himself experiencing unaccustomed heart throbs upon being presented to the adorable Dorothy.  The girl did not offer him her hand, but, after gracefully acknowledging the introduction, lifted her limpid gray eyes to the gentleman's face with an earnest, straightforward look which told him that she was one who judged people somewhat from first impressions.  His glance held hers for a moment, during which he was particularly attracted by the sweet serenity of her gaze, while he was at the same time conscious that every feature of her lovely face was aglow with intelligence and vivacity.  Her skin was fine and clear, with a touch of rose on her cheeks; her lips a vivid scarlet.  A wealth of red-brown hair was arranged high on her head, thus adding to her stature and poise; her features, though by no means perfect, were fascinatingly expressive, especially when she spoke or smiled.  Her graceful, symmetrical figure was clad in virgin white, with no ornament save a string of rare pearls that once had belonged to her grandmother Appleton; and, to her new acquaintance, Dorothy Ford appeared the embodiment of loveliness and purity.  ""Allow me to thank you both for the great pleasure I have just enjoyed,"" Mr. Alexander remarked, when their greetings were over, the sincerity in his tones saving his observation from seeming triteness.  Madam Ford smiled with motherly pride as she gracefully thanked him, and, bending a fond glance upon Dorothy, added:  ""I really feel that my daughter is entitled to congratulations, since this is her first appearance, professionally, before a critical audience.  I must confess, however, to having experienced some inward quakings in view of that fact; but her first note reassured me----""  ""Why, mamma, I am surprised!"" laughingly interposed Dorothy, but flushing with pleasure, nevertheless, in view of her mother's commendation, Mr. Jerome's approving eyes, and the evident appreciation of her new acquaintance--""after all your careful coaching, not to mention Signor Rotoni's merciless training for this important event! Moreover, the burden of responsibility rested entirely upon you, and I wasn't conscious of a quake, though I confess I might not have felt quite so confident if I had been obliged to face all these people alone.""  ""So this is your dbut before society, Miss Ford?"" Mr. Alexander observed, and charmed by the maiden's refreshing ingenuousness.  ""Yes, as a vocalist; not socially, however, for Mrs. Jerome kindly introduced me, with Miss Jerome, some time ago,"" Dorothy replied, adding: ""I have, perhaps, enjoyed some advantages to give me confidence which dbutantes, as a rule, do not have.  Mamma having been so much before the public, I have also had my responsibilities in the profession, for""--with a laughing glance at her mother--""I have frequently acted as her chaperon when she has had engagements at a distance from home.""  ""'Chaperon!'  That is rather good, Helen,"" Mr. Jerome here dryly interposed, and bending a pair of twinkling eyes upon madam.  ""Well, you do look almost youthful enough to need a chaperon; Alexander was saying only a few moments ago he thought you and Dorothy must be sisters.""  ""There, mamma, now will you believe what I said to you before we left home?"" gleefully exclaimed Dorothy.  ""I told her,"" she went on, nodding brightly at Mr. Jerome, ""that she is growing younger every year, and no one would suspect that she is the mother of a twenty-five-year-old daughter----""  ""'Sh--'sh!  Oh, Dorrie, _how_ indiscreet to tell it!"" interposed her host, in pretended consternation at her frankness.  ""Perhaps it was,"" retorted the girl, with a roguish gleam in her eyes. ""I did not realize what my admission would imply, and I humbly beg mamma's pardon for trespassing upon so delicate a subject,"" and she curtsied with mock humility to her mother, without a vestige of self-consciousness for having given away her own age.  ""Now, I suppose it behooves me to offer thanks to Mr. Alexander for a very pretty compliment,"" demurely observed Madam Ford, when the laugh at Dorothy's clever repartee had subsided.  ""Oh, Helen,"" groaned Mr. Jerome, who dearly loved to hector, ""I am surprised to hear you giving thanks for a compliment at your charming daughter's expense!""  Then, turning to Dorothy, he added, with an air of commiseration: ""Dorrie, dear, you have my deepest sympathy in view of your aged appearance; if you had only not persisted in growing up, so early, to be so mature, tall, and stately, people would not have been so prone to mistake you for your mother's sister,"" he concluded, bestowing a reproachful look upon the young man standing beside her.  ""Really, Jerome,"" Clifford Alexander here laughingly interposed, but with heightening color beneath his friend's persistent banter, ""I seem inadvertently to have stumbled upon dangerous ground, and there appears to be no way to either advance or retreat with any glory to myself. Pray tell me how I am to propitiate so gallant a champion as you have constituted yourself; also this fair lady""--with a deprecating glance at Dorothy--""whose cause you so ardently espouse.""  ""This 'fair lady' and her 'champion,' as you are pleased to regard me, have been lovers ever since she was a small girl in short dresses, I would have you understand, and I warn you, young man, that I am very jealous for her--eh, Dorothy?"" Mr. Jerome asserted, with a delightful air of proprietorship.  ""However,"" he continued, ""I can assure you she is easily propitiated, for she is exceedingly amiable.""  ""That, I am sure, goes without saying,"" affably assented the young man.  ""Exactly; and, taking her all in all, she is '_simply adorable!_'"" retorted his host, in a significant tone, as he thus quoted the young man's own words of a few moments previous, and which again sent the quick color to his face.  Dorothy had thoroughly enjoyed the tilt at her expense, but now she began to feel the situation becoming a trifle embarrassing, both for herself and her new acquaintance; and, turning brightly to him, she merrily observed:  ""Pray, do not mind him, Mr. Alexander; he is the greatest tease in New York.  He has hectored me for years, and does not half realize that I have grown up to be almost mamma's double; for really we are more like two devoted chums or sisters than like mother and daughter.""  ""Miss Ford, I am everlastingly obliged to you for the olive branch of peace you so kindly extend to me,"" the gentleman smilingly returned. ""And now, as the room is very warm, won't you come and let me get you an ice, or a glass of punch?  I am sure Mr. Jerome will kindly care for Madam Ford.""  ""Thank you; I shall be glad to have an ice, if you will be so kind,"" Dorothy cordially assented.  She nodded a gay adieu to her mother and Mr. Jerome, as she turned to accompany her escort, who shot a look of mock triumph at his host as he walked off with his coveted prize.  ""That is a mighty fine fellow, Helen,"" remarked her companion, as the two young people disappeared among the throng.  ""He is certainly good to look upon; not exactly what would be regarded as a handsome man, but decidedly distinguished in appearance, and with evidences of a fine character written on his strong face,"" madam replied.  ""You are right; but he has never been a 'ladies' man,' much to the chagrin of many of our New York mothers.  I am surprised at his walking off so summarily with Dorothy--no,"" he corrected, ""I am not surprised, either, for Dorrie would melt a statue of ice.  Next to my Mollie, she is the most glorious girl I know.""  Madam Ford smiled as she bestowed a grateful look upon the speaker for his high praise.  ""You have idealized Dorothy, I am afraid,"" she returned, with evident emotion; ""but one is prone to endow those in whom one is deeply interested with the rich qualities of his own nature.  You are so thoroughly good yourself, my friend, you can see nothing but good in others.""  ""Somebody else, I perceive, is looking through rose-tinted glasses at this very moment, Helen,"" lightly responded her companion.  ""Well, you must not forget that you have put some rose tints into my life during the last ten years; you have also been almost like a father to my child, and I am not likely to forget it--nor the heavenly kindness of your wife, either.""  Helen's lips were tremulous as she concluded.  ""My wife is a gem of the first water,"" responded her companion, in a low, intense tone, a fond look in his fine eyes, as they rested upon a stately woman standing in the full light of a brilliant chandelier not far from them.  ""Indeed, she is,"" Helen heartily assented, as her glance followed his; for never in her life had she met a couple who lived in such perfect accord with each other as Homer and Lena Jerome.     CHAPTER X.  A BRIEF RETROSPECT.  Ten years have elapsed since Helen Hungerford was deserted by her husband, and left almost destitute to begin again the battle of life for herself and her child.  After having been introduced to New York society, she began immediately to prosper.  Mrs. Jerome, the sister-in-law of Helen's dearest friend, had at once interested herself in her career as a drawing-room artiste, with an enthusiasm there was no opposing; she started the ball rolling for her, and Helen's charming personality, with her cultured, delightful voice, her determination to please and to succeed, did the rest.  Each year her engagements and pupils multiplied; and, having followed the advice of the Jeromes to set her prices at a figure to give dignity and value to her services, she soon became the fashion, with an ample and constantly increasing income at her command.  This had, ere long, enabled her to locate in a more desirable part of the city, and to handsomely furnish a large apartment, with a studio for her musical work; and, with competent help to relieve her of all domestic drudgery, she found life easier and brighter than it had even been since the first year of her marriage.  Neither did she relax effort in her own behalf; she put herself under a noted finishing teacher, both to enhance her own attractions and to keep her repertoire up to date.  Dorothy, also, was given every advantage, and at the age of nineteen entered college, from which she graduated four years later.  Meanwhile, she also had developed a decided talent for music, possessing a rich contralto voice that promised great things for the future; and the ensuing two years were spent in making the most of her talent, until, as we have seen, she was beginning to create quite a stir in musical circles, and to share honors with her mother.  They had lived very harmoniously during most of this time, trying to forget the bitter past, and every year becoming nearer and dearer to each other, until, as Dorothy had told Clifford Alexander, they were ""more like two devoted chums or sisters than mother and daughter.""  But all this had not been achieved without severe struggles on the part of Helen.  During the first two years of her sojourn in New York, notwithstanding her almost phenomenal success, she had been bitterly unreconciled to the fate that had doomed her to live out her life as a deserted wife, to be both father and mother to her child, and had even necessitated the concealment of her identity in order to save Dorothy the mortification of being known as the daughter of a divorcee.  She had seasons of wretched brooding, almost amounting to despair, during which it would seem that she could not force herself to fulfill her engagements; when she simply wallowed in the mire of bitter humiliation, rebellion, and self-pity, in view of having been made the target of a malicious fate, the football of an irresponsible man's fickleness, indolence, and selfishness; of an unscrupulous woman's blandishments and coquetry, and her life wrecked in its prime.  For herself, aside from her child, the future seemed to hold no promise; she was not yet forty years of age; she might live forty years longer.  Would she have courage sufficient to sustain her so long--to carry this intolerable thorn that rankled in her heart continually? And what made this thorn in the flesh so intolerable? she sometimes asked herself.  If her husband had died, she might have grieved for a time over the memory of his unkind treatment of her; but eventually the sting of it would have ceased, and the wound would have healed, and she would have forgiven him.  And what was this thorn, anyway?  The question came to her, almost like an audible voice, one day, when she had been more than usually depressed; and, with a sudden inward shrinking from herself, it was forced upon her that it was of her own planting and nourishment, and its sting was her own bitterness, hate, and resentment against the living man, who had left her for another; and also hatred against the woman who had decoyed him from her.  She recoiled from the shocking revelation with a sense of loathing.  It was as if she had discovered a nest of poisonous vipers writhing in her own bosom, but which she had carefully and persistently nursed, calling them by other names--disgrace, injured innocence, martyrdom, righteous indignation, et cetera--hugging their stings and the corroding sores they produced.  Immediately upon awakening to this she resolved to purify her consciousness from what she now recognized as willful sin and selfishness.  She conscientiously tried to divest herself of the habit of dwelling upon the unhappy past; she strove to bury it so far out of sight by throwing herself more heartily into her work, and into Dorothy's interests and pleasures, that even its ghost could never arise to confront her again.  As time passed, she gradually grew to feel that she was really rising above it.  The clouds of depression began to lift, the sun of prosperity melted away the mists of anxiety and care for the future, while the appreciation and kindness of increasing friends broadened and cheered her life in many ways.  It was generally believed among her many patrons in New York that Madam Helen Ford was a widow.  None, barring the Jeromes, knew aught of her history, save--according to rumor--that she had belonged to a good family in the far West, and, having been left with a little one to rear and educate, had, upon the advice of her friends, come East to make the most of her beautiful voice.  Mrs. Jerome's exceeding kindness to her, upon her arrival in that great, strange city, had at once won Helen's heart, impelling her to confide everything to her new friend, and thus relieve herself from the consequences of deception toward those who were doing so much for her; and from that hour the noble woman and her husband had been like brother and sister, and of the greatest comfort to her; while the simple fact that the Jeromes had introduced and vouched for her to society was sufficient guarantee to give her the entre among some of the most cultured people in the metropolis.  They also became very fond of Dorothy, and, having a daughter of about the same age, made much of the girl, often inviting her to their home and to share many of Mollie Jerome's pleasures.  The two girls became very friendly, attended the same school, entered and graduated from college at the same time, and thus Dorothy, aided by her own personal attractions and sweetness of disposition, acquired a position among the younger generation in good society that was of great advantage to her.  When Mollie Jerome made her dbut, Mrs. Jerome included Dorothy in the receiving party, and in this way she also was practically introduced, although she did not care particularly for so-called fashionable society, neither would her circumstances allow her to keep up with its arbitrary demands.  Nevertheless, the kindness of these friends, together with the advantages her mother had given her, enabled her to enjoy many delightful opportunities which otherwise she would have missed, and fitted her for the position she was destined later to occupy.  Now, after ten years, having made her professional dbut, in the home of her good friends, she felt she was well launched upon a career that would insure her independence for the future, and also enable her to relieve her mother of some of the burdens she had borne alone for so many years.  On the evening of his introduction to her, Clifford Alexander had found her to be an exceedingly bright and cultured girl, full of energy and spirit, yet possessing an underlying purity and sweetness of character that were inexpressibly charming to him, who, having seen much of life abroad and in this country, had come to regard the majority of fashionable young ladies as frivolous and shallow, absorbed in worldly pleasures, and possessing little love for domestic life and its sacred duties.  Thus he had yet never met any one with whom he felt willing to intrust his future happiness, and so had come to be regarded a confirmed bachelor--or, as Mr. Jerome had put it, ""no ladies' man.""  After partaking of some refreshments together, Clifford Alexander, desiring to prolong the interview with his companion, suggested a visit to Mr. Jerome's wonderful library and picture gallery, which occupied the entire fourth floor of his dwelling, and contained many rare gems, both of art and literature, over which even connoisseurs were wont to become enthusiastic.  Here they spent a delightful half hour, during which they discovered much pertaining to their individual aims, pursuits, and tastes that was congenial with each other.  Then Dorothy was obliged to return to her mother, to assist further in the evening's entertainment.  But during this brief interview she had unconsciously woven a magic web about the heart of her new acquaintance, that was destined to prove far stronger than the supposedly confirmed habit of reserve with which he had heretofore fortified himself against all allurements of the fairer sex.  Clifford Alexander was now in his thirtieth year, and a man of no ordinary type.  One look at him was sufficient to reveal the fact that he possessed a masterful, purposeful individuality, a character of unswerving integrity, and lofty ideals.  An attractive, intellectual face; a pair of shrewd, yet genial, dark eyes; a pleasant, rich-toned voice, with a courtly, gracious manner, all bespoke the refined, high-minded gentleman.  Since leaving college, most of his time had been spent in Europe, where he had attended to the foreign branch of a lucrative business established by his father.  Now, Mr. Alexander, Senior, having recently retired, his son had been recalled to this country to fill his place, as the head of the house, while another member of the firm was deputed to look after the interests abroad.  Following the evening of his introduction to them, young Alexander was enabled to keep pretty well posted, through his friends, the Jeromes--particularly through Miss Mollie Jerome--regarding the engagements and movements of Madam Ford and Dorothy.  He did not fail to make the most of this information, and thus the way was opened to meet them frequently and cultivate their acquaintance; and it goes without saying that he made the most of every opportunity.  Helen had been greatly attracted to him from the first, and, as the formalities of their early interview began to melt into more friendly relations, she gained a deeper insight of his character, which only served to increase her admiration and respect for him.  Neither was she unmindful of the fact that Dorothy's eyes grew brighter, her smiles sweeter, the rose in her cheeks deeper whenever he sought her side. Hence when, one evening, at a social function, he gravely asked her if she would accord him the privilege of calling upon her and Miss Ford, she cordially granted his request, even though she could not fail to understand from his earnest manner the deeply rooted determination which had prompted his action.  He pursued the advantage thus attained most industriously and vigorously.  His wooing was ingenuous, straightforward, irresistible. He loved with all his heart, and he pressed his suit with no less earnestness of purpose.  He won the prize he coveted, and six months from the evening of their introduction the engagement of Miss Dorothy Ford to Mr. Clifford Alexander was formally announced to their many friends.  That it was a most desirable and suitable alliance was the general verdict of all who knew them.  The Alexanders, as a family, were especially happy in view of it, for they had lost an only daughter some years previous, and they lovingly welcomed the beautiful and talented girl as the prospective bride of their son.  Helen was filled with joy and exceeding gratitude, and a great burden was lifted from her heart.  Dorothy's future was most luxuriously provided for, both in the wealth of affection bestowed upon her and the opulence that would henceforth shield her from all care or hardship. The name of Ford, by which Helen had never been addressed without a secret sense of fraud, would now be swallowed up by one that no breath of taint had ever touched, and her child would be protected from all danger of association with the unhappy events of her youth to mar her life.  As the engagement was to be a short one, therefore, at Mr. Alexander's request, Dorothy withdrew from all professional work, and proceeded to give her time and attention wholly to the delightful occupation of preparing for her approaching marriage.     CHAPTER XI.  A SEALED BOOK REOPENED.  One day shortly after the announcement of her engagement, Dorothy sought her mother, upon the departure of her last pupil, her face unusually grave and a trifle careworn.  ""Mamma,"" she began, with some hesitation, ""I have been thinking, and do you not think, that we ought to tell Clifford about--about our past?""  Helen turned upon her with a look of dismay, and flushed a startled crimson.  This was the first time during many years that their unhappy history had been alluded to by either; for, soon after taking up their residence in New York, Helen had forbidden the topic.  She wished Dorothy to forget the harrowing past, even if she herself could not; hence it had been carefully avoided by both.  She had gradually grown to hope, if not actually to believe, that those wretched experiences had been blotted from her memory; or, at least, had become so vague and indistinct that they no longer disturbed her peace.  Their life, for the most part, had flowed on so smoothly and harmoniously, they were so devoted to and happy in each other, and also in their social relations; they had a delightful if not an elegant home, with every comfort and many luxuries, while each succeeding year seemed to hold more and more of promise for them, that this tragic chapter of the long ago had become, even to Helen herself, very like some dream belonging to a previous existence.  Hence Helen had not once thought of reviving the sad story in connection with Dorothy's prospective marriage, and when the girl gave utterance to her unexpected proposition she began to think, with a terror-stricken heart throb, that she had, perhaps, been very remiss in not having frankly confided to Mr. Alexander, when he had come to ask of her Dorothy's hand in marriage, the fact of her husband's disgraceful desertion of her, and that she was a divorced wife, practically living under an assumed name.  This unforeseen predicament came upon her like a crushing blow, and, for the moment, the old rebellion and resentment, which she thought she had long ago conquered, took possession of and mastered her with even more than the old-time bitterness and force.  How could she ever face it--this relentless test of her integrity!  It was an ordeal before which she shrank affrighted.  Did she need to face it?  Why not let everything go on without uncovering this grave of the dead past, the outcome of which might prove very disastrous to Dorothy's bright hopes, and so break her own heart?  The Alexanders were proud, high-toned people.  How would they receive such a revelation?  What if the story of John Hungerford's disgraceful career should ruin Dorothy's life at this supreme moment?  Suppose, in spite of their apparently increasing affection for her, this aristocratic family should absolutely refuse their consent to the alliance of their son with the daughter of a divorcee?  Oh, it was passing strange that she had not thought of all this before!  It had been forced upon her now, however, with a shock that deprived her of every atom of strength, for she knew the truth must be told.  ""How do you feel about it, dearie?"" she at length forced herself to inquire, after an interval of silence, and to gain more time to think before voicing a more definite reply.  ""Mamma, it seems dreadful!  I cannot bear to revive unpleasant memories for you,"" Dorothy began, turning a troubled face upon her.  ""Still, we----""  ""But, Dorrie, our own past cannot be questioned--our lives have been pure and above reproach.  Why, then, is it necessary to disclose that for which we are in no way responsible?"" Helen questioned, after another long pause.  ""We have not heard a word from--from him during all these years.  He may be dead--I think he must have died, or we should have heard something.  At any rate, he is dead to us!  Why, then, resurrect all that dreadful story?""  Her voice quivered with repressed agony, and there was a note of despairing appeal in her tones that smote her listener keenly.  ""But would it be quite honest not to tell Clifford?  My name is really Dorothy Hungerford, you know,"" she gravely responded.  ""The decree gave me the right to resume my maiden name, or to retain his--whichever I chose.  If I preferred to keep the latter portion of his, I cannot think there would be any dishonesty in your being married as Dorothy Ford,"" Helen argued, but not feeling quite comfortable or honest in the position she had assumed.  ""All the same, there would be a deceptive thought back of it--something to conceal from my husband, which might some time cloud our lives if it should be discovered later,"" Dorothy persisted, a troubled look in her eyes.  Helen groaned bitterly in spirit.  She knew that the girl's attitude was the only safe one to adopt, but she shrank from the ordeal with a sickening dread.  ""Have you no fear that this confession may cloud your life even before your hopes are realized?"" she questioned, almost sharply, in her despair.  ""Mamma, surely you do not fear _that_!"" Dorothy cried, aghast, her face blanching suddenly snow white.  ""The Alexanders are very proud,"" sighed her mother.  ""Oh, I never thought of anything so dreadful!"" said the girl unsteadily.  ""I have such faith in Clifford's love for me.  The only reason I have hesitated was because I could not bear to wound you by recalling our trouble, by having to tell any one what you have had to bear.  But now""--with a sudden dauntless uplifting of her head--""I must tell him immediately.  If there is the least danger that this disclosure will change his regard for, or his intentions toward, me, or will make trouble between him and his people, it is better to know and meet it now than when it would be too late to remedy the mistake.""  ""But could you bear it, Dorrie?"" almost sobbed Helen.  ""Think, dear, what the worst would mean to you.""  ""_Whatever_ comes, I _must bear it_!  I cannot, will not, live a lie!"" was the low-voiced, firm, but almost inaudible reply.  ""I know you are right, dear; but it seems so unjust that the innocent should have to suffer as we have suffered for the sins of another,"" said Helen rebelliously.  Throughout their conversation there had been running in her mind, like a mocking refrain, a portion of the old Mosaic law--""visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,"" et cetera--and she found herself vaguely wondering who could have formulated such a law.  She could not believe God had made it, for God was good--Love, and surely there was nothing good or lovely about this seeming curse.  Yet it had been handed down for ages--a menace to every generation.  It was certainly very cruel.  Here was Dorothy, a beautiful, cultivated girl, well fitted to grace the position her lover could give her, and now, to have her brilliant prospects blighted just on the verge of fulfillment seemed too dreadful to contemplate.  Again there had been a long silence between mother and daughter, during which each had battled with her troubled thoughts and conflicting emotions.  At length Dorothy arose, and, going to Helen, knelt down before her, leaned her elbows upon her lap, and dropped her pretty chin into her small, white hands.  ""Mamma, I am sure we will not have to suffer for being true,"" she said, lifting a clear, smiling look to her.  ""How faithless we are!  How disloyal of me to think anything so unworthy of the best man that ever lived!  I am not going to fear that telling the truth, in order that I may go to Clifford with a clear conscience, will spoil my life; he is too high-minded, too noble, to allow a wrong for which I am in no way responsible to part us.  But--even if I knew it would, I should tell him all the same; it is the only honorable course to pursue,"" she concluded, with a look in her beautiful eyes that bespoke a purpose as unflinching as the spirit of a martyr.  Helen bent and kissed her on the forehead.  ""You shame me, dear; but I know you are right,"" she said humbly, but adding, with a shiver of repugnance: ""Do you want _me_ to tell him, Dorrie?  If it will save you----""  ""No, indeed, mamma, dear!  I could not think of subjecting you to anything so dreadful,"" interposed the brave girl, a quiver of repulsion in her tones.  ""I wish _I_ could have saved _you_ this trial,"" she went on yearningly; ""but I knew it would not be right to keep the truth from Clifford, and now I want to tell him myself, because--I must look straight into his dear eyes as he listens; then I shall know----""  ""Oh, darling, forgive me if I have aroused a doubt in your thought--have implanted a fear in your heart, that he will not stand the test!"" cried Helen remorsefully, as Dorothy's voice suddenly faltered and failed her.  ""You have not,"" returned her companion, almost defiantly.  ""_I know he is true blue_.  I will not think anything else.""  So Dorothy told her lover her story, ""looking straight into his eyes,"" when he came to her that evening, keeping nothing back, nor trying to gloss anything over; and when she was done, like the true-hearted man he was, Clifford Alexander gathered her into his arms, murmuring fondly:  ""Sweetheart, put it all out of your mind; never give it another anxious thought, for it belongs among the shades of the dim past, and the present and the future are all that concern us now.  Just know that I love you for what you are, and that I honor your mother for the noble woman that she is.  She has shown wonderful fortitude during all these years, and deserves the highest esteem of every one.  As for your--that man--whether he be living or dead, he has passed forever out of your life; so be happy, dearest, and let none of these memories ever cloud your dear eyes again, or cause your dear heart a single tremor.""  ""Clifford!  Clifford!"" tremulously breathed Dorothy, while she clung to the strong arm enfolding her.  ""I knew you would not fail me.""  But she was quivering in every nerve with repressed excitement, from the reaction produced by the blessed assurance of his unimpeachable loyalty, the unfailing love that was the light of her life, and had safely weathered this crucial hour.  ""Fail you, Dorothy!"" he repeated, surprise and reproof blending in his tones.  ""Could I fail to cling to what is my very life?  I am glad you told me, however; it shows the confidence you repose in me, and proves your absolute integrity,"" he concluded, with a smile that made her thrice glad she had not been tempted to withhold the truth from him.  Helen's troubled heart was also set at rest, when, later, they sought her with radiant faces, and Clifford delicately yet feelingly referred to her early trials, and earnestly begged that she would allow him to be to her, through all her future, a son in truth as well as in name.  Thus, with all fear regarding Dorothy's future forever dispelled, as she fondly believed, she joyfully resumed her preparations for their approaching union.     CHAPTER XII.  THE SOUBRETTE.  Helen had seemed almost to renew her youth while making ready for Dorothy's marriage, and had thrown herself into the business before her with no less enthusiasm than that manifested by the fair bride-elect herself.  She simply reveled in choosing the dainty and pretty things that were to comprise the trousseau, while with her own skillful fingers she fashioned many lovely accessories, which, had she purchased them, would have been very expensive, if not entirely beyond her means.  Dorothy was to go into a beautiful and sumptuous home; she would mingle with fashionable and wealthy people, whom, in turn, she would also have to entertain; and, with rare judgment and faultless taste, Helen had planned an ample outfit for her, that was both elegant and suitable for all occasions, yet without being too costly for her income.  One morning, a few days after Dorothy had related the story of their early troubles to her lover, mother and daughter started forth upon one of their interesting shopping expeditions.  They were in their brightest mood, for, with the happy termination of the much-dreaded ordeal which their sense of honor had compelled them to face, with a free conscience, and increased love and respect for the man who was soon to assume closer relations with them, the world seemed all rose color and gold to these devoted chums as they pursued their way downtown with a long list of items upon their memorandum tablets.  They spent a busy morning together, after which they had a light lunch, when, at one o'clock, Dorothy had an appointment with her dressmaker, and Helen went back to the stores alone.  Among other things, there were handkerchiefs to be selected, and she slipped into Rolston's to see what she could find there.  As she paused before the counter, she found herself standing beside a woman who was evidently waiting for her change and her purchase to be returned. Something about her figure and the contour of her face--which, she observed, was heavily powdered and rouged--impelled Helen to take a second look; when, as if actuated by some occult influence, the stranger turned a bold, rude stare upon her, and chain lightning could hardly have been more swift or blinding than the blazing, spiteful look which leaped into her eyes as they swept Helen from head to foot.  A vindictive sneer began to curl her full, red lips; her heavy brows contracted in an ugly, frown, as, with a mocking shrug of her shapely shoulders, she shot forth a single venom-barbed word:  ""Well!""  Instantly, with a shock that seemed to cleave her heart in twain, Helen recognized her.  She was the soubrette, Marie Duncan, with whom John Hungerford had gone abroad ten years ago, and whom he had afterward married.  But she was no longer the gay, captivating coquette she had been when she had lured him from his allegiance to his family.  Her form had grown stout, less symmetrical than of yore; her features coarse and sensuous; her skin had become rough and porous, from too free use of cosmetics, and evidently the world was not at present using her very well, for she was cheaply clothed, though with a tawdry attempt at style which only accentuated the fact of her poverty.  The terror inspired by this startling encounter was simply paralyzing to Helen.  She deigned no reply to the actress' rude salutation; but, with a mighty effort to preserve her self-control, turned to a clerk, and, with a semblance of composure which she was far from feeling, inquired for what she wanted.  The woman stood watching her for a minute or two, the sneer still curling her lips, as, with jealous eyes, she noted every detail of her costly, tailor-made costume, her simple though stylish hat, her perfectly fitting gloves, and the elegant shopping bag which she carried.  Then, with a mocking, sibilant laugh that made her listener's flesh creep with painful revulsion, she swept insolently past her, and was lost in the crowd.  Helen selected a dozen handkerchiefs at random, gave her address to have them sent to her; then, half fainting, a blinding haze before her eyes, a deafening ringing in her ears, groped her way from the store, and boarded a car for home.  All the way uptown she sat like one dazed, vaguely wondering what had happened to her.  Her heart lay like a great stone in her bosom; all her strength and vigor seemed suddenly to have withered within her, and the whole world to have grown dark, and desolate, and threatening.  ""It cannot be,"" she moaned, as she entered her apartment and mechanically began to remove her hat and coat.  ""How can I bear it? Oh, to have struggled all these years to outlive that dreadful experience, only to be faced with it anew at such a time as this!""  She shivered as she recalled the brazen, defiant, mocking looks the woman had bestowed upon her; and that hissing, menacing laugh--what did she mean by it?  She wondered if John had come back to this country with her--where and how they were living.  Marie's clothing had told its own story of poverty and makeshift; perhaps now they would try to find her again; John might even seek to extort money from her as of old, and she would be subjected to a system of blackmail to protect herself and Dorothy from a harrowing scandal.  She had tried to make herself believe that she would never see either of them again; she had long ago felt a sense of freedom in the thought that John must be dead, or she certainly would have heard something of, or from, him; and she shuddered now as she remembered that she had never quite dared to hope he was.  It was a murderous thought, she knew; but, living, she felt she could never forgive him--dead, she could at least try to forget him.  She was almost in despair, in view of this unexpected reappearance of Marie, which threatened to make havoc of her life.  Must she tell Dorothy, to spoil her present happiness and cloud her approaching nuptials?  No, she would not, she resolutely affirmed.  It would be hard to bear her burden in silence, and wear a happy exterior, but she would, she must, rise to the occasion and help her carry out her plans as if nothing had happened--unless circumstances made it impossible to do so.  She sat for hours, brooding wretchedly upon the situation--until she heard Dorothy's step on the stairs, when she braced herself to greet her with her usual welcoming smile as she entered the room.  The following week Dorothy was invited to spend a few days with the Alexanders, at their delightful home on the Hudson.  Helen had also been included in the invitation, but excused herself because of appointments with pupils and an entertainment for which she had to prepare.  She thought it would, perhaps, be a relief to have Dorothy away for a while, at least, until she could recover more fully from the shock she had received, and she willingly let her go alone.  While engaged with her pupils Helen found no time for brooding; but when the lessons were over and she was released from all restraint, she could not control her thoughts, and the fear and unrest of the previous week assailed her again.  The second day of Dorothy's absence, which was the Sabbath, she felt that she could no longer bear the loneliness and silence, which were intensified and made hideous by haunting memories of her unhappy past; and she now deeply regretted that she had not heeded Mrs. Alexander's plea that she would at least join their house party for over Sunday. She was half tempted even now to take an early boat and go to them, just for the day; but, having once definitely refused the invitation, she did not like to retract; but do something, go somewhere, she must to distract her mind; she could not spend that long day alone with her wretched thoughts.  She mechanically dressed herself for the street, and, boarding an uptown car, finally alighted near one of the entrances to Central Park.  As she stepped upon the sidewalk her attention was attracted by a stream of well-dressed people that were pouring into a great church not a stone's throw beyond where she stood.  Almost unconsciously she mingled with the crowd, passing with it into the beautiful temple, and up into the great auditorium, where the mellow sunlight, streaming in through the richly tinted windows, seemed to fall upon the gathering hundreds like a sacred, soothing benediction; while the wonderful organ, responding to the touch of skillful hands, rolled forth its paean of joyous greeting.  A gentlemanly usher approached and offered to give her a seat, leading her almost to the center of the house, where, thanking him for his courtesy, she dropped into a luxuriously cushioned pew, wondering, with a sense akin to dismay, what occult influences could have combined to guide her wandering feet thither, instead of into the park, for which she had started.  Presently she began to look about the elegantly appointed edifice, noting its softly tinted walls and beautiful windows; its rich and massive woodwork, its costly carpeting and upholstery.  Then her glance swept over the congregation, and she found herself mentally exclaiming, with a pang of keen pain piercing her heart: ""What a multitude of happy, peaceful faces!  Where did they come from?  What is the secret of their joy?""  Presently the organ ceased, and the opening hymn was announced--an old, familiar tune, and lines that her mother had once loved to sing:    In heav'nly love abiding,   No change my heart shall fear.   Quick, tender tears welled to her eyes--it almost seemed as if her mother were there beside her as the organ softly played it through; then a sense of awe fell upon her at the sublime burst of harmony that followed.  She had never heard anything like it before.  Everybody was singing, and yet the magnificent volume of sound that surged upward into space from that many-throated congregation was like one grand, gloriously inspired voice pouring forth its harmonious notes of praise to the author of ""heavenly love.""  She never forgot it; it was like the momentary lifting of the opaque curtain 'twixt earth and heaven, beyond which she caught a fleeting glimpse of fields elysian, the entrance to which must be through the Gate of Love alone.  The Bible reading followed, but she did not give much heed to it, for the spell produced by the music was still upon her, though now and then she caught a phrase which impressed her that Love was the subject or text chosen for the day, until suddenly, like a solemn message from Sinai, thundered out to her alone, came the startling words: ""Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.""  She sat erect, every sense now alert, and listened to the closing passage: ""He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen?""  She did not hear another consecutive sentence.  She sat like one benumbed throughout the service, but with her heart in a turmoil such as she had never experienced before--the words ""love"" and ""hate"" ringing continual changes in her thought.  She thought she had always known their full import; she had read those passages from the Bible perhaps a hundred times; but never until now had she been arraigned before the bar of an inexorable judge, to be sifted as wheat in the thought, and purpose, and intents of her heart toward her brother man.  When the benediction was pronounced, a richly clad woman who had been sitting beside her turned, with cordially extended hand, to greet her. She was very beautiful to look upon, with peace written on every line of her face, love shining in her clear blue eyes, and a crown of snow-white hair rippling above her forehead; and yet she could not have been fifty years of age.  ""I think you are a stranger here?"" she observed, with a smile that almost made Helen weep, it was so sunny, yet so sympathetic.  ""I hope you have enjoyed our service.""  What was there about her that so summarily broke down Helen's habitual self-control?  She never could account for it afterward, but before she was really aware of what she was saying she burst forth:  ""What _is_ love?  What is--_hate_?""  ""My dear,"" returned the stranger, with exceeding gentleness, while she studied Helen's set features with compassionate eyes, ""that is a question which cannot be elucidated in a moment; but let me say, as I read your thought just now, love is not emotion, sentiment, mere personal attachment; it is the abiding desire to do good to our neighbor--to all men--for the _love of doing good_.  'Hate' is criticism, condemnation, resentment.  Are you in haste?"" she added, with a winning smile.  ""Could you stop for a little talk with me?""  ""I could not this morning,"" said Helen, with unsteady lips and voice, and just on the verge of a nervous burst of tears.  ""Then, will you come again some time?  I am always in this pew on Sunday morning, and will be glad to see you.  Good-by, dear.""  She slipped a card into Helen's hand, and turned to greet another, for she saw that her recent companion needed to be left to herself for the present.  Helen quickly made her way from the church, anxious to get away from the crowd, and, crossing the street, entered Central Park.  She was nearly spent with the inward conflict she had been undergoing during the last hour, and she was eager to get out into the open, under the blue sky and green trees, to be alone, to think, to analyze the new and startling phase of her own character that had been so strangely revealed to her.  She glanced at the card in her hand.  ""Mrs. Raymond B. Everleigh,"" she read, and somehow the euphonious name soothed and appealed to her even as the beautiful face and winning voice of the woman had done.  She strolled slowly about for a while, thinking deeply along the new lines suggested by what she had just heard within the church.  Love, she had learned, was not a mere emotion or sentiment, to be put on or off according to the attraction to or repulsion for the personality of those with whom one lives or mingles.  No, she had just been awakened to see it possessed a far deeper, higher significance than that.  Love--to be love--must be a motive power, an indwelling principle, an all-absorbing desire always impelling one to do good.  To do good to whom?  To all men, she had been told.  And hate?  ""Hate is criticism, condemnation, resentment,"" she repeated, a shiver sweeping swiftly through her frame.  ""Oh, I have never really _loved_!"" she breathed, with an inward sense of aversion for herself.  ""But--I have hated all my life!  I have simply been clinging to selfish, pleasurable emotions and sentiment, which have been aroused by the personal attractions and pleasing qualities of my friends, my child, and other dear ones, and which I have _called_ love; but I begin to see something which I have never dreamed of before.""  She dropped upon a near-by seat, to try to think out the problem more clearly; but the subject seemed infinite, and a sense of depression began to fall upon her as she became more and more involved in its intricacies.  A sudden burst of merry laughter at length aroused her from her reverie, and she gradually became interested in other visitors to the park, and particularly in some happy children, who were abandoning themselves to the charms and freedom of the place and to their games.  Carriages and other equipages were continually passing along the broad avenue, and presently her attention was attracted by a party of gay people who were approaching in an automobile.  They were laughing and talking boisterously, and, as they drew nearer and then passed, a woman leaned forward in the vehicle and leered at her.  It was Marie Duncan, the soubrette!  Helen was almost convulsed with inward terror as she met her eyes, but she made no visible sign that she had recognized her, and the car swept on.     CHAPTER XIII.  A TRYING INTERVIEW.  It could not have been more than five or ten minutes later, and before she had recovered any degree of composure, when rapidly approaching footsteps caused Helen to turn and glance over her shoulder, to find the actress almost beside her.  ""Mrs. Hungerford appears to be enjoying an outing this bright day, as well as others,"" the woman observed, in a flippant tone.  Helen shrank sensitively at the sound of the old name, but made no reply, and arose to pass on.  ""Sit down!"" curtly commanded her companion.  ""I have something to say to you; you need not pretend that you do not know me, for you do, and I have no intention of being ignored.""  ""You certainly can have nothing to say to me that I care to hear,"" Helen quietly returned.  ""Indeed!"" retorted Marie, with a short laugh.  ""Well, now, perhaps you may find yourself mistaken.  At any rate, it may be for your interest to listen to me.  To begin with, and not to mince matters, I want some money.""  ""Money!"" repeated Helen, amazed at the audacious demand.  ""Exactly.  You appear to be in very comfortable circumstances, Mrs. Hungerford,"" said the actress, sweeping a comprehensive glance over Helen's rich and tasteful costume.  ""Fate seems to have treated you very kindly during the last ten years, and it is only fair that you should share the good things the gods have bestowed upon you with one less fortunate.  Really, madam,"" she continued, with insolent sarcasm, ""you appear to have gotten on better without your husband than you did with him; you must have become possessed of some potent mascot which has enabled you to rise above adverse circumstances and provide so handsomely for yourself.  I heard, the last time I was in San Francisco, that you were in New York, making a lot of money as a crack music teacher; that you had given your daughter a fine education and many accomplishments; that you were living in luxury, and had made many influential friends.  All this must have cost you a pretty sum, and your accounts can't be very small with your milliner and tailor, either, both of whom certainly do you and themselves great credit. Pray tell me how you have accomplished it all?  I know you are a good manager; John told me that, and----""  ""Where is he?""  The question slipped out almost before Helen was aware of what she was saying.  She only knew she feared he might have been with the party in the auto and would also appear upon the scene before she could get away.  ""Blessed if I know, or care!"" was the indifferent response.  ""I gave him the grand bounce three years ago.""  ""Do you mean----"" Helen began, then checked herself.  Why should she lower herself talking with this coarse creature?  Why ask questions or seek information from her?  What did it matter to her what she had or had not done, or what her relations with John now were?  ""Do I mean that I divorced him?"" the actress surmised the import of her question, and caught her up.  ""That is exactly what I did, and glad enough I was to be free from the lazy hanger-on!  I was a fool ever to have anything to do with him.  He had quite a bunch of money when we first went abroad, but when that was gone he just played the gentleman, and let me take care of him.  I haven't seen him since--he may be dead, for all I know.""  The heartlessness of her tone as she concluded implied that she did not care if he were dead, and Helen remembered with a thrill of horror how a sense of freedom had come to her with the same thought, not long ago. Could it be possible that she had fallen to the level of this vulgar woman?  What was the motive that prompted them both to wish another human being out of the world?  What but hate, the deadliest of all impulses.  The words she had recently heard smote her again, with accusing force: ""He that hateth his brother is a murderer.""  The thought was so repulsive to her that involuntarily she threw out her hand in a gesture of repugnance and self-aversion.  ""I'm looking out for number one now, but I've had hard luck the past year,"" the actress resumed, her eyes dropping, with a look of greed, to the silver purse in Helen's hand.  ""I've _got_ to have some money, and I--I think, madam, you will find it to your interest to--to hand over a few dollars to me now and then.""  Helen's eyes began to blaze, in view of the underlying menace implied more by the woman's tone than by her words.  ""I!  Why should _I_ give you money?"" she indignantly demanded.  ""Well, I think you owe me something for taking care of that husband of yours for seven or eight years.""  ""He wasn't my husband!"" Helen sharply interposed.  The woman laughed derisively.  ""Well, then, for taking him off your hands; surely that was doing you a good turn, and you should not begrudge me a share in the luck you have had since you got rid of him.""  Helen was disgusted.  She felt degraded to be standing there and bandying words with her, and she turned resolutely away, determined to put an end to the revolting interview.  Her companion planted herself in her path.  ""Oh, don't be in such a hurry, Mrs. Hungerford; for really you will have to open that pretty purse for me before you go,"" she said peremptorily.  ""I shall give you no money,"" Helen firmly replied.  ""I--think you--will, or----""  ""What do you mean to imply?""  ""I don't believe you would like to have that old scandal rehearsed here in New York,"" said the actress, in a menacing tone.  ""You would not dare----"" began Helen excitedly, and heartsick at the thought.  ""One will dare most anything when one comes to the end of one's rope, and hasn't any friends to fall back on,"" was the dogged response.  ""Aren't you on the stage now?""  ""No.""  ""Why not?""  The erstwhile actress shrugged her shoulders and made a grimace.  ""Passe,"" she observed laconically, adding: ""Besides, it has got to be a grind, as John used to say when he had anything like work to do.""  Helen with difficulty repressed a cry as this old, familiar phrase fell upon her ears; but she drew herself haughtily erect.  ""I shall give you no money,"" she reiterated.  The actress laughed in her face.  ""I was told in San Francisco that your daughter has grown to be a beautiful young woman,"" she said.  ""How do you think she would enjoy having her father's history served up in the newspapers here?  It would be a sweet morsel for your fine acquaintances--wouldn't it?--with the pictures of all three of you, and mine to go with them, to head the chapter!  And I have them; I found them among John's things, and have kept them all these years.  Now, I will sell them to you for a fair consideration, or I will give them, with that savory story, to the first reporter who will make it worth my while.""  This terrible threat nearly caused Helen to collapse.  At the same time her brain was very active as she reviewed the situation.  Marie had several times addressed her as Mrs. Hungerford, which convinced her that, although she had managed to obtain considerable information regarding her in San Francisco--how, she could not comprehend--it was evident she had not learned that she had repudiated her name; consequently, even if she attempted to give her story to the newspapers, it was doubtful if any one would suspect that Madam Helen Ford, the popular drawing-room artiste, of New York, was once the wronged and deserted wife of John Hungerford, of California.  She had changed much in appearance, and Dorothy had entirely outgrown her girlish looks; hence those old photographs, even if reproduced in the newspapers, would not be associated with either herself or her daughter, for such cuts were seldom much better than caricatures, even at their best.  She believed she would really gain nothing if she yielded to the actress' demand that she buy them from her, for, having once obtained money in this way, she would doubtless follow up her advantage with other efforts of a similar nature, and thus subject her to an intolerable bondage.  As these thoughts flashed through her mind, Helen took courage and began to lose her temper at the same time.  ""I shall pay you nothing for those photographs, or bribe you to silence,"" she spiritedly returned, ""and if you are so lost to all sense of honor and humanity as to seek to bring disgrace upon two innocent and long-suffering people, who, for years, have patiently struggled to rise above the desperate conditions imposed upon them through no fault of their own, you will have to take whatever satisfaction you may reap in carrying out your malicious purpose----""  ""You will be sorry for this, madam----""  ""You have told me that John had plenty of money when he went abroad with you,"" Helen continued, without heeding the interruption, while she looked straight into the bold, insolent eyes of her companion.  ""Do you know where he got that money which he frittered away upon you and his selfish, ignoble, unlawful pleasures?  _He stole it from his own child_!  It was a small legacy left me by my father, and, when I began to realize how improvident John was, I put it sacredly away in Dorothy's name, to save it for her education.  When I was about to leave San Francisco, I went to the bank where this money had been deposited, to withdraw it, to help me make a new start in life.  I was told that Mr. Hungerford, as the legal guardian of his child, had closed the account some months previous.  This dastardly deed left us penniless.  The blow crushed me--bereft me of both courage and hope, for the time.  How much of this legacy John may have spent upon you I have no means of knowing!  Doubtless no small part of it, for he was lavish as long as he had a dollar in his pocket.  Now, in view of these circumstances, my refusal to comply with your present demand may not, perhaps, seem so unreasonable as at first you appeared to regard it.""  A great change had come over the actress while Helen was talking.  At first she had faced her with brazen assurance, her eyes flashing anger and defiance when Helen dared her to carry out her malicious purpose; but when she had told her that John had stolen the money from his child, immediately following his desertion of his family, a hot, swift flush mounted to her brow, her face fell, and her aggressive attitude was supplanted by evident discomfiture and humiliation.  She stood silent and thoughtful for a full minute after Helen ceased speaking, and when at length she slowly lifted her heavily fringed lids the previous expression of mockery and malice in her eyes had been replaced by a look of mingled dejection and shame.  ""Well--you've won!"" she began, in a low, repressed tone; then she suddenly turned her back upon Helen, and stood looking stoically off over the green slope beyond them, where the happy children were still playing, their fresh young voices and joyous laughter falling musically upon the summer air.  Helen watched her curiously, something in her attitude instinctively appealing to her, and preventing her from using her opportunity to slip away from the place, as she was half tempted to do.  Presently the woman turned back to her, with an evident effort to control the emotions that had well-nigh overcome her.  ""Yes, you've won,"" she repeated, her chin quivering in spite of her. ""You've given me a facer I didn't expect, and I have nothing more to say.  You needn't be afraid, either, that I will ever lift a finger to harm you or the girl, after this.  You're game, through and through, to have stood up under all that I know you have--to say nothing about that money--and weathered the breakers.  I'm far from being a saint, but I am not all bad, and I do love little children.  I used to think I would love to have a home, like other people, and a little daughter of my own, and I would live on crusts before I would ever rob a child of its birthright, and if I have helped to squander your girl's, why--I--it won't be very comfortable to remember for the rest of my days.""  Her voice suddenly broke, and she was obliged to pause.  ""Life is a strange muddle,"" she presently went on, with a queer catch in her breath, while she searched Helen's white face with a look of mingled respect and yearning, ""and woman, somehow, seems to get the worst of it in the struggle.  Some of us drift with the current when troubles come, and go steadily downstream to our ruin; others, like you, resolutely grip the helm, and work their way back to a safe harbor.  I will never cross your path again, Helen Hungerford--you are justly entitled to the victory you have gained over adverse circumstances without being made to fight your battles all over again. I've envied you, and I've hated you, for John was continually throwing your superior virtues in my face; but you have robbed me of my fangs today, and from now on I will never place a straw in your path.""  Without pausing for a reply, the woman turned abruptly, and walked swiftly away, leaving Helen dazed and speechless, in view of this unexpected termination of the exciting interview.  When she began to recover from her astonishment the actress was out of sight, and a sudden revulsion of feeling assailed her.  A great pity welled up in her heart for the unfortunate woman whose lot in life, she was sure, had not been an easy one; perchance it had been even harder than her own.  She had acknowledged that she was passe, that her profession had become a grind, and that she was in desperate need of money.  Her clothing was cheap--shabby genteel--perhaps she even knew what it was to be hungry--and Helen wished now she could call her back and give her some money.  ""Truly life is a strange problem,"" she said to herself, as she slowly wended her way from the park and boarded her car for home, her spirit chastened by the experiences of the day, her heart strangely softened toward Marie Duncan, for whom she had always entertained only condemnation and resentment--bitter hate--because she had robbed her of her husband, and entailed a lifelong blight upon her own future.  Now she was almost moved to tears for her.  Surely she was ""not all bad,"" as she had said, for, down deep in her heart, there was a germ of good, some redeeming qualities, which, under right conditions, might have expanded and ripened into a noble womanhood; for she ""loved little children;"" she had even yearned for ""a little daughter"" of her own. Who could say, had that sacred heart longing for motherhood been gratified, but that she might have become a power for great good in the world--the matron of a happy home, the mother of a promising family?  Three days later, on taking up the morning paper, Helen read of a shocking accident that had occurred the previous evening.  A party of actors and actresses had been precipitated down an embankment while returning from an out-of-town automobile trip.  The chauffeur had lost control of his car, which he was running at a reckless speed; two had been instantly killed and three badly injured.  Two of the latter were in a fair way to recover, but the once brilliant and beautiful Marie Duncan, of light-opera fame, was now lying in the Mercy Hospital, hovering between life and death, with no hope of recovery.  ""How strange, and how dreadful!"" murmured Helen, in a tone of awe. Marie had told her that she was no longer before the public, that she was ""passe,"" and without money; that she had, in fact, ""come to the end of her rope.""  It seemed now almost like a prophecy come true. Helen wondered if she had a friend in the world to be with her, or to do anything for her in this supreme hour of her life.  She sat thinking for a long time, evidently seriously considering some important move, for her face wore a grave and perplexed expression, while every now and then she restlessly changed her position, as if her thoughts annoyed her.  At length she aroused herself, and deliberately tore the paper she had been reading into atoms.  ""Dorrie must not see this,"" she muttered, an anxious look in her eyes. Then she started violently, sprang to her feet, scattering the fragments upon the floor, and went directly to her telephone.  ""Good morning, Mr. Alexander!  I hoped you would answer me,"" she said, when the connection she had asked for was made.  ""Everything is well with you all, I trust?  Dorrie not down yet!  Well, it is a little early, perhaps.  Have you seen the morning papers?  Have you read about the shocking accident of last evening?  ""Oh, thank you!  How very thoughtful!  I could not rest until I had asked you to destroy it,"" she said tremulously, as the answer to her query had come back, assuring her that the paper had already been burned, and Dorothy should be tenderly guarded from every possible chance of seeing the name that could not fail to recall the unhappy past.  They conversed for a moment or two longer; then Helen hung up the receiver, the cloud of anxiety gone from her brow and a great burden from her heart.  She gathered up the pieces of torn paper and threw them into the wastebasket; then, hurriedly dressing for the street, she went out.     CHAPTER XIV.  ""LOVE THY NEIGHBOR.""  Helen hastened to the Mercy Hospital with all possible speed.  At the office she gave her name as Mrs. Helen Hungerford, and was quick to observe that a peculiar look flitted over the face of the gentlemanly attendant as she did so.  She inquired for Marie Duncan, and was told that although the woman was comparatively free from pain, and her mind clear, her injuries were of such a nature that she could not live many hours.  ""Would it be possible for me to see her?"" Helen inquired.  She believed that the once popular favorite was utterly friendless, as well as penniless--in fact, she had practically admitted as much, and with the revulsion of feeling that had followed after Marie had shown the better side of her nature, there had come the desire to help the unfortunate woman in some way.  Hence, when she had read of the terrible accident and its probable fatal termination, she had hurried to the hospital to ascertain if she could be of some comfort to her in this bitter extremity, all her aversion and resentment submerged in pity for one who was nearing the dark river of death.  She was not a little surprised, however, when in response to her inquiry the attendant observed:  ""It really seems a singular coincidence, madam, but the woman has begged at intervals during the night that we should send for a Mrs. Helen Hungerford; however, as she was unable to give us the address, and it could not be found in the directory, it has, of course, been impossible to grant her request.  If you will be seated, I will send some one to ascertain if you can be admitted to the patient,"" he concluded, as he courteously placed a chair for her.  Helen marveled at what she had heard.  What could Marie Duncan want of her?  It certainly was a peculiar situation--unique, she believed, in the annals of history, that she, the discarded wife of John Hungerford, should be entreated to come to the bedside of the dying woman who had robbed her of her husband!  It was even more strange that she should have been impelled to come to her without a suspicion of Marie's desire for her presence.  Perhaps she wished to leave with her some message for John, in case he were still living, and ever sought her again.  Helen shrank with repulsion from the thought, and almost regretted that she had come.  She had no desire ever to see him again, much less to be the bearer of any last words from Marie to him.  She was beginning to be exceedingly nervous and uncomfortable, the more she thought of the approaching interview, when the messenger returned and said the nurse wished her to come immediately upstairs.  She was presently ushered into a small room on the second floor, at the back of the building, and experienced a great sense of relief upon finding that she was not to be subjected to the trying scenes of a ward, as she had feared.  Marie Duncan, white and wan, but looking far more womanly with the paint and powder of a few days previous removed from her face, threw out an eager hand to her as she drew near her cot.  ""Oh, I am sure God must have sent you!"" she said weakly.  ""I have wanted you so, but they""--glancing at the nurse, who, having placed a chair for the visitor, was moving toward an adjoining room--""could not find your name in the directory, and I thought I'd have to go without seeing you.""  Almost unconsciously Helen clasped the hand extended to her, and dropped into the rocker beside the bed.  ""I came just as soon as I read about the accident,"" she said.  ""_Why_ did you come?"" questioned Marie, her beautiful dark eyes hungrily searching Helen's face.  ""I--don't know--unless it was because you told me you had no friends.""  ""What could it matter to you whether I had or not?"" almost sharply demanded the patient.  ""You must hate me like the d----""  She checked herself suddenly, with a gasp and an appealing look at Helen for pardon, in view of her slip.  Helen bent nearer to her as she replied, with grave gentleness:  ""I am afraid I have thought very unkindly of you--at least, until last Sunday.  I am glad to say I do not feel the same to-day.""  ""And I tried to _blackmail_ you last Sunday!"" said Marie, with a bitter curl of her white lips.  ""I know; but you also showed me something of your better self, which made me regret that I had not been a little more kind to you.  I would have given you some money after that, if you had not left me so suddenly.  But,"" Helen continued, with a glance at the door through which the nurse had disappeared, ""I am afraid we are talking too much for your good----""  ""Talking won't harm me now,"" the woman interposed, her brows contracting painfully.  ""I know I have, at last, really got to the 'end of my rope.'  I'm glad, though, it is not an end of my own making. I've sometimes thought that might be the easiest way out of this muddle we call life; but somehow I was ashamed to sneak out of a hard place in such a way, even though I'd leave nobody behind to care.""  ""They told me downstairs that you were wishing to see me,"" Helen broke in to change the gruesome subject.  ""Why did you want them to send for me?  Is there anything I can do for your comfort, now that I am here?""  Marie lifted her great eyes and searched her companion's face curiously.  ""For my comfort!  _You!_"" she cried; then hastened to add: ""No, but _I_ wanted to do something for you and your girl.  I haven't had a very pleasant time since you told me about that money, and I want to give you those newspapers and photographs, so that they will not fall into the hands of any one else, to make mischief for you.  This is my bag, hanging here on the bed; will you open it for me?""  Helen took down the receptacle, and did as she had been requested.  ""There is a ring of keys in it.  This one""--as Helen handed them to her--""is the house key--number one hundred and one Fourth Street, where I've lived lately; this unlocks the door of my room, and this is the key to my trunk--I've got reduced to one, and there isn't very much that is worth anything in it, either,"" she interposed, with a bitter smile.  ""Those newspapers and pictures are at the bottom; take them, and do what you choose with them.  My marriage certificate is there, too, in a wallet.  I'd like you to destroy it.  It hasn't meant very much to me, for I have never felt as if I were really John's wife, or that I had any guarantee in it that he would remain true, and not divorce me, the same as he did you.  In my opinion, divorces are worse than Mormonism,"" she sarcastically interposed, ""for Mormons can't shirk their responsibilities after they have got tired of one wife and taken another.""  She paused to rest for a moment or two; then resumed:  ""I have never used his name very much, and I would prefer no one else to see the certificate; most people have always called me, and I am perfectly willing to have them remember me only as, Marie Duncan.""  Helen was surprised and deeply touched as she listened to her.  What she had said hinted at more depth of character than she had ever given her credit for; while her wish to have only herself see the certificate, and her evident desire to be remembered only by her stage name, betrayed a delicate consideration for her and Dorothy that caused her to feel even more kindly toward her.  ""I know it will not be a very pleasant task for you to do what I ask,"" Marie went on apologetically; ""but I thought you would like to have those papers----""  ""I would, indeed,"" said Helen earnestly, ""and it is very thoughtful in you to arrange for me to get them.  I will do anything else you wish that will be of any comfort to you.""  ""The daughter of the woman with whom I have lived has been very good to me, and you can give her everything in the room and trunk belonging to me,"" said Marie, after thinking a moment.  ""My jewelry is all gone; this one ring""--holding up her left hand, on which there was a plain band of gold--""is, like my trunk, all I have left, and it can stay just where it is.  But I have one nice stone in my purse""--glancing at the bag in Helen's lap.  Helen drew forth the purse and searched until she found a small wad of tissue paper tucked into an inside pocket.  Removing the wrapping, a diamond worth, perhaps, two hundred dollars fell into her hand; and there were also a few dollars in money in the purse.  ""I have kept that for--for such a time as--this,"" Marie faltered, ""though there have been times when I've thought I would have to let it go.  I'd like you to hand it, with what money there is, in at the office downstairs, to--to----""  ""I will; but pray do not try to talk any more now,"" interposed Helen, for she saw that, in spite of the brave front the woman was trying to keep up, she was stricken with terror whenever she thought of the fast-approaching end.  The nurse now entered the room with a cup of nourishment in her hand.  Helen arose to make room for her, saying inquiringly:  ""I think perhaps I ought to go now?""  ""No!  Oh, please do not!"" weakly pleaded Marie.  ""If you _can_ stay, it will be a comfort to her, and""--with a significant look which her patient could not see--""it will do her no harm.""  ""Very well, then, I will remain for a while longer,"" Helen returned, as she moved to a window and stood looking out upon the grounds below while the nurse fed her patient.  What a strange experience! she said to herself.  What mysterious influence could have guided her steps thither that morning, in direct answer, as it seemed, to Marie's desire to see her?  She could understand how Marie, awed and softened by the knowledge that she was soon to go out into the great beyond, might wish to make some restitution for the wrong in which she had been a partner, by trying to protect her own and Dorothy's future from the old scandal; but she could not account for the revulsion of feeling that had obliterated all ill will and resentment from her own consciousness, making her oblivious to everything but the fact that her rival was a suffering, dying woman, alone in a great extremity, and in sore need of being comforted and sustained as the shadows closed around her.  A great peace fell upon her, and she was glad that she had come. Perhaps, she thought, she was beginning to learn something of the love of which Mrs. Everleigh had told her the previous Sunday--the desire to do good for the sake of doing good.  When she looked around she found the nurse had gone, and Marie was in a light sleep.  She went noiselessly back to her chair by the bed, to wait for her to waken, and as she studied the colorless face upon the pillow she was impressed more than ever by the remarkable beauty with which she had been endowed.  The features were very symmetrical, and just now seemed more refined than she had ever seen them.  She had smooth, shapely brows, and an abundance of dark-brown hair, while the tips of her white, still perfect, teeth were just visible between her slightly parted lips.  She did not seem at all like the coarse, defiant, passe person, in tawdry attire, whom she had met only a few days before.  Suddenly Marie opened her eyes; there was a wild, terrified look in them; but they at once softened into an expression of content as they rested upon Helen.  ""Oh, you _are_ here!"" she breathed.  ""How good of you!  I dreamed it was growing dark, and I could not find you.""  ""I will stay as long as you wish me to,"" Helen assured her.  ""I am--_afraid_!"" said Marie, after a moment of silence, a gray pallor settling over her face.  ""I haven't been a very good woman.  What is there beyond?  Oblivion, or doom?""  ""Neither,"" said Helen, with gentle compassion; ""but, instead, an awakening to larger, better experiences and fresh opportunities.""  ""How do you know?""  And her listener's face and voice were full of eagerness.  ""I cannot say that I really '_know_' anything about what is beyond us when we go away from here,"" Helen gravely returned; ""but I have grown to think that we are like children going to school.  We have our various classes, or grades, and merge from one into another, according as we have done our work ill or well----""  ""I think that is beautiful!"" broke in Marie, a thrill of something like hope in her tone.  ""Then, if one has wasted one's time, and learned nothing good here, one can begin all over again--one will have another chance?""  ""I believe so,"" Helen replied.  ""I believe it, too!"" said Marie, after another interval of silence. ""It seems reasonable, and surely all nature teaches it.  A man may sow poor seed to-day and reap a poor harvest; but he will see his mistake, and have a chance to do better another season.  I am so glad you told me--I don't seem to mind what is coming quite so much.""  She lay quietly thinking for a while, and Helen hoped she would fall asleep, but presently she resumed:  ""I have done you a great wrong, Helen Hungerford, for I knew about you in Paris; but I liked a good time, and I led John on--away from you.  I am sorry now.  And your daughter!  I have never forgotten her face, that day in San Francisco, when my auto was detained beside the car she was in, and she saw her father with me--it was so ashamed, so distressed----""  ""I am sure you ought to rest--do not talk any more now,"" Helen again pleaded, for Marie was showing signs of weakness, while she herself shrank from these references to her unhappy past.  She leaned forward to straighten her covering, which had become slightly disarranged, when Marie lifted a corner of the lace scarf she was wearing, and humbly laid it against her lips.  Then she closed her eyes wearily, and was presently asleep.  The nurse, coming in soon after, felt her pulse, and, turning to Helen, observed:  ""If you would like to go, I think you may; I do not believe she will waken again.""  ""Perhaps I will, a little later,"" said Helen, who was not quite ready to forsake her post so soon after telling Marie that she would remain as long as she wished her to.  An hour slipped by almost in silence, when, without a movement to show that she had wakened, Marie's white lids were lifted, and the ghost of a smile curled her lips, as her dark eyes met Helen's.  ""I--shall have another--chance!  I shall--begin all over--again,"" she breathed weakly, but with no sign of fear.  Once more she seemed to sleep, and at the end of another hour Helen went home.     CHAPTER XV.  A STARTLING APPARITION.  The next four months slipped swiftly away.  They were filled full with joyous anticipations and pleasant occupations, while Helen, now that she no longer feared Dorothy's happiness or prospects would be disturbed, regained her accustomed serenity, and once more became absorbed in the numberless details involved in making ready for a wedding.  A great burden had been lifted from her heart, for all those menacing newspapers and photographs, with every other telltale evidence of the unhappy past, that had been treasured by the once popular opera favorite, had been destroyed, and nothing remained that could even remotely bear witness to it, save a small tablet, bearing the name of ""Marie Duncan,"" that had been placed in a quiet corner of a distant churchyard outside the city.  The months of August and September Dorothy and her mother spent in the Berkshires, on a pleasant farm adjoining ""Avondale,"" the fine estate and summer home of the Alexanders.  This arrangement was made for the benefit of the lovers, in order to enable them to see each other every day, and enjoy the pleasures of country life together, during the brief interval previous to their marriage.  The wedding had been set for the first of October, and, at the request of the bride-elect, who shrank from the confusion and excitement of a society function, was quietly solemnized at noon on that date, in the pretty near-by village church.  Here Helen gave her daughter away to the man whom she believed to be in every way worthy of her one treasure, and the simple ceremony was followed by a reception and an elaborate breakfast at Avondale for the limited number of friends who were bidden to grace the occasion.  Thus, with apparently nothing to cast a shadow over her future, Dorothy Ford became the wife of Clifford Alexander, and the happy couple went away for a month or two of travel, while a beautiful home, adjoining the Alexander estate on the Hudson, was being prepared for their occupancy upon their return.  Mr. and Mrs. Alexander, Senior, returned immediately to their home on the Hudson, and Madam Ford to New York to resume her work and prepare for her winter engagements.  In planning his new residence, Clifford Alexander had arranged for a delightful suite of rooms which he placed at Helen's disposal, with a pressing invitation that she would make her future home with Dorothy and himself.  Helen was deeply touched by this evidence of his sincere regard for her, but she gently declined, telling him she thought a newly wedded couple should begin their life and home making alone with each other; while, too, she would not be willing to give up her work for a long while yet; hence she must have her studio in the city, and it would be better for her to live there, as usual.  ""But you have labored continuously for many years--you have spent your life for this dear girl""--bending a fond look upon his fiance--""whom I have won away from your nest.  Now come and rest, and _play_ with us--at least, for a while,"" the young man had urged.  And Dorothy had also pleaded:  ""Do come, mamma, dear; it will be lovely to have you with us.""  ""I do not deny that my 'nest' will be lonely without her,"" Helen had replied, smiling bravely through a mist of sudden tears; ""but I could not be idle, and the nestling must learn to use her own wings.  All the same,"" she went on, more brightly, ""I am not going to allow you to forget in the days to come that you have added a mother-in-law to your list of responsibilities, and I warn you that I intend to drop in upon you often enough to keep you both upon your best behavior.""  ""Well, madam mother-to-be,"" said Mr. Alexander, smiling at her threat, ""the rooms are there--they were planned for _you_, and I hope some time to see you very comfy in them.  I would not impose any sense of obligation upon you; I wish you to be happy in your own way, but please bear in mind always that it would give us great pleasure to have you with us.""  Helen lifted a searching look to his face.  ""Pardon me; but are you sensitive regarding my occupation--my career?"" she inquired.  He laughed out softly as he read her meaning.  ""Pray do not fret yourself about that,"" he said.  ""I do not quite dare to tell you how exceedingly _proud_ I am of you and your career.  I sometimes wish, though, that you did not keep so busy with _pupils_--I assure you there is not the slightest need----""  ""Oh, but I love the dear things!"" Helen eagerly interposed.  ""They bring so much brightness and joy into my life.""  ""Of which, believe me, I would not rob you in the least degree,"" the gentleman earnestly replied, and, seeing she was very much in earnest, he pressed the matter no further.  So Helen resumed her work, as usual, upon her return to New York.  She was in perfect health, and still a very beautiful woman.  She was also happy in Dorothy's happiness; life seemed very bright, and she looked forward to the coming season with much of anticipation, even enthusiasm.  One morning, about a week after the wedding, she went up the river to the new home, which was fast nearing completion.  It was now in process of being decorated and furnished, under the supervision of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander, Senior, who insisted upon having her join them whenever she could spare the time, to give them the benefit of her taste and knowledge regarding Dorothy's preferences.  They spent a delightful day together, overseeing the placing of china and bric-a-brac, the hanging of draperies, pictures, et cetera, and attending to numerous other details.  At noon they enjoyed a dainty lunch, prepared and sent over by the cook at the other house, in Dorothy's bright, luxuriously appointed kitchen; then they resumed their pleasant occupations, working busily until it was time for Helen to go, when she was whirled down to the steamer landing in Mr. Alexander's fine limousine, just in time to catch the early evening boat back to the city.  It was a balmy, almost summerlike, evening in spite of the fact that it was on the verge of November, and Helen, securing a camp chair, made her way to a sightly spot on the stern deck, and seated herself to enjoy the delightful atmosphere and lovely scenery as the steamer glided smoothly down the river.  She was in a most harmonious frame of mind, for her heart was at rest and the future full of hope.  There was a joyous light in her eyes, and a happy smile on her lips, as, in imagination, she looked forward to Dorothy's home-coming, and the delight she would experience in taking possession of that luxurious nest awaiting her among yonder beautiful hills, away from the dust and turmoil of the busy metropolis.  As the boat drew near to its pier she rose and leisurely made her way inside to descend to the lower deck. She had just reached the head of the stairs, where she was forced to pause a moment because of the crowd ahead of her, when some one behind her gave utterance to a startled, but quickly repressed, exclamation.  Involuntarily she glanced back over her shoulder at the sound, when her features suddenly froze into a look of horror.  ""Helen!"" faltered a voice she could not fail to recognize, notwithstanding it was tremulous from emotion and hoarse from a heavy cold.  But the man!  Could that haggard, white-faced creature--that emaciated, poorly clad figure, with his shabby hat, neglected beard and hair, ever have been the cultured, debonair, elegant John Hungerford, who had wooed and won her girlish heart and hand more than twenty-five years ago?  Instinctively she shrank away from him, and he, observing this involuntary act of repugnance, flushed scarlet from mingled pain and shame.  Then the crowd surged in between them, and Helen, with a wildly throbbing heart and a sense of despair and hot rebellion almost suffocating her, forced her way on shore with all possible speed, sprang upon the first car she saw, and hoped she had effectually evaded that startling apparition.  But her peace of mind had been destroyed.  All the brightness and joy of that happy day were suddenly blotted out, swallowed in by the terror inspired by this unlooked-for calamity which now threatened anew both herself and Dorothy.  It was a terrible, a crushing, blow.  She could not sleep that night; she could not apply herself to work of any kind the following day; she dared not go out of the house, lest she meet that ghost of the past again, and every time her bell rang a shock of fear that he might be without, seeking entrance, went quivering through all her nerves.  ""Would he hunt her down?"" she was continually asking herself.  ""Would he dare intrude himself upon her life again, after all these years?"" She turned faint and heartsick at the thought.  But the day waned, the dinner hour passed, and, with the curtains drawn and lights all about her, she began to experience more of a feeling of security; to take courage, and try to assure herself that she had successfully eluded him, and he would not be able to ferret her out in that great city, even if he tried.  She had just settled herself for the evening with a new book--one of several that Dorothy had given her before going away, telling her, with a suspicion of tears in her voice: ""For your evenings, mamma, dear, so you will not miss me quite so much""--and was beginning to get really interested in the plot of the story when her bell rang a sharp, shrill peal.  Her maid, who had been with her for several years, had sailed for Scotland for a long-promised visit home, when Helen went into the country for the summer, and, not yet having secured another to take her place, she was obliged to answer the summons herself, which she did with a quaking heart.  ""A message for Mrs. Ford,"" came up through the tube.  Helen's fear was instantly turned into joy.  ""A message from Dorothy,"" she thought, for she had received either a letter or a telegram from the happy bride almost every day since her departure.  ""Come up,"" she eagerly responded, as she pressed the button governing the lower entrance.  Presently, hearing steps on the stairs, she swung open the door of her suite, when, with a gasp of dismay, she found herself face to face with John Hungerford.  She would have shut the door upon him, but he was too quick for her. He forced his way inside, and then closed it himself.  ""I must see you, Helen,"" he panted, as he sank, pale and breathless, upon a chair in the reception hall.  ""Oh, why have you come?"" she demanded, with white lips.  ""Because I could not bear it any longer; I was starving to see you and Dorothy.  Where is she?""  ""She is married.""  ""Married!  Dorothy married!  When?""  ""Two weeks ago yesterday.""  ""To whom?""  Helen straightened herself resolutely.  ""I shall not tell you that,"" she replied, with sharp decision.  ""She is happy, and I will not have her life clouded by anything to recall the troubles of the past.""  The man shivered at her words.  He was but a miserable shadow of the John Hungerford of ten years ago.  His form was shrunken, his clothing faded and worn, his face was pale, his cheeks hollow, and his eyes sunken and lusterless.  ""But, Helen, I want to see Dorothy--she is my child.  I must see her!"" he faltered, a note of agonized appeal in his tones that ended abruptly in a hoarse, hollow cough.  ""You must _not_ see her!"" Helen emphatically returned, and thinking only of shielding Dorothy from the pain and shame of such a meeting.  Her words and her apparent indifference to the uncontrollable yearning within him seemed to anger him.  ""She is as much my child as she is yours,"" he shot back, with a flash of his old-time doggedness.  Helen flushed an indignant scarlet.  ""As much your child as she is mine!"" she scathingly exclaimed.  ""You claim that!  You, who deserted us both; who robbed her of her little fortune, and left me in poverty to rear and educate her as best I could, while you wasted your stolen thousands upon that woman and your degrading and sinful pleasures!  Your child!  _What_ have you ever done for her that entitles you to make the shameless boast?""  The man cringed abjectly beneath her words, but made no attempt to reply, and Helen resumed, her indignation still at the boiling point:  ""I have spent my life for her; I have spared nothing to give her every advantage, to make her a noble, cultured woman, and to shield her from every sorrow.  During the last ten years of her life she has known nothing but happiness; she has married a good man, and a gentleman in every sense of the word.  He is prosperous, and belongs to a much-respected and well-known family here in New York.  So Dorothy's future is very promising, and I will never allow you to cast a shadow upon it, or mar her joy in any way.""  Her listener shifted uncomfortably in his chair.  ""You seemed rather happy yourself, when I saw you yesterday,"" he observed, with a covert sneer, after an interval of awkward silence; ""and""--glancing curiously about him--""you appear to be remarkably prosperous, also.""  ""I am prosperous; I am well established in my profession here.""  ""As 'Madam Ford,' I perceived, as I rang your bell.  So you dropped the old name?"" said John Hungerford, in a tone of exceeding bitterness.  ""Yes, the first half of it, as I also dropped that half of my life for all time; but for Dorothy, I would have retained no part of it,"" said Helen tersely.  Her companion's lips twitched, while his bony hands gripped the arms of his chair convulsively.  ""You are handsomer than ever, Helen; you don't begin to show your years,"" he presently observed, as he swept her face and figure with yearning but gloomy eyes.  She did not deign to reply, although she moved restlessly where she stood, as if his words annoyed her beyond endurance.  ""I suppose you haven't much love left for me?"" he falteringly resumed, after a minute, the silence between them becoming embarrassing again.  ""Love--for _you_!"" she retorted, with an emphasis that caused him to shrink as from a blow.  ""Well, I'm not claiming that I deserve anything of the kind from you,"" he remarked, in a weak voice, at the same time drawing in a quick, deep breath.  ""However, there is some solace in remembering that you were once fond of me.  Maybe, not having heard from me for so long, you have believed me dead?""  ""I have, of course, had no means of knowing whether you were living or dead,"" Helen coldly replied.  ""Perhaps it might have been a relief to you if I had died,"" said John, as, with hopeless eyes, he searched her frozen face for some sign of the old-time gentleness.  She made no answer.  She was not quite heartless enough, even in her despair over his reappearance, to confirm this gruesome suggestion; yet she was keenly conscious that his presence was almost intolerable to her.  A low, bitter laugh escaped him at her silence, and again a cruel cough racked him.  ""Have you a picture of Dorothy?"" he inquired, when he recovered his breath.  ""Yes, several.""  ""I want to see them,"" the man exclaimed, a mighty yearning in his voice; and, rising from his chair, he began to look eagerly around the room for some likeness of his child.  Helen neither moved nor spoke to hinder him.  She felt dazed, helpless in this terrible dilemma.  She was frightened, rebellious, desperate to be thus confronted with this appalling skeleton of her past, this menace to Dorothy's bright hopes.  John Hungerford passed from the reception hall into the parlor, a lovely room, most artistic and dainty in its coloring, decorations, and furnishings; and, shoving his hands into his coat pockets, as if to brace himself against a consciousness of intrusion and rudeness, he began his search for Dorothy's pictures.  Helen, who had followed him, sank, quaking, upon a chair, too weak and unnerved to remain standing a moment longer, and wondering miserably what would be the outcome of this harrowing interview.  Suddenly the man paused, an exclamation of delight escaping him.  He had espied a full-length photograph of Dorothy, taken in her wedding robes.  ""This is----"" he began tremulously, and turning a face quivering with uncontrollable emotion to Helen.  ""Yes,"" she briefly replied.  ""How beautiful she is!  She looks as you looked the evening we were----""  Helen shivered, and her white teeth came together with a snap that arrested the word on his lips.  ""Whom did she marry?"" he demanded, almost fiercely, after studying the picture for a minute or two.  ""I shall not tell you,"" Helen doggedly reiterated, and unutterably thankful that Mr. Alexander's likeness was not beside the other to tell its own story.  She had found it was, for some reason, beginning to curl, and she had taken it down and laid a heavy book on it only that morning.  ""But I will tell you this,"" she presently resumed: ""Her husband is a man to whom any father or mother might be proud to give a daughter, and Dorothy will never know a care or sorrow which an absorbing affection and most unselfish devotion can avert.""     CHAPTER XVI.  SACKCLOTH AND ASHES.  John Hungerford flushed suddenly crimson; then paled to a sickly hue at Helen's words.  Evidently her statement that Dorothy's life and happiness would be most tenderly shielded by a considerate and devoted husband aroused memories of the past that were far from pleasant.  He stood silently studying the photograph for several minutes, his face showing evidence of deep inward emotion.  Finally replacing it upon the mantel, he moved on, curiously observant of the handsome furniture, choice bric-a-brac, draperies, and pictures that were tastefully arranged about the room.  As he drew near a door leading into an adjoining apartment that was used as a library, he paused, and stood irresolute.  ""Helen--may I look through the suite?"" he eagerly questioned, but with evident embarrassment.  ""May I see Dorothy's room?  I--I would like to know how you two have been living; it will be something to--to remember.""  Helen's head sank wearily back against her chair.  She was white to her lips from her efforts at self-control.  ""I don't care--go where you like,"" she breathed, in a scarcely audible voice.  The man passed noiselessly into the library, where he was no less observant of what it contained than he had been in the parlor. Presently he moved out into the hall, and on to a chamber which he realized at a glance must be Helen's.  Leading from it was another and smaller one, and this, he was sure, as he entered it, had been Dorothy's.  It was the daintiest room imaginable.  Excepting the bed, which was of brass, the furniture was all of white enamel and willow ware in graceful designs.  Spotless draperies of muslin over white shades hung at the windows, and were slightly looped with broad blue ribbons.  A beautiful blue-and-white rug lay upon the light hardwood floor, and the fireplace was also tiled in the same colors.  Here John Hungerford lingered for a long time, moving silently, and treading softly, as if he felt himself intruding upon some sacred place.  He paused before each piece of furniture, noting every detail in outline and upholstery.  Not an article of the frosted-silver toilet set upon the pretty dresser escaped his notice; he even noted her class pin and two small baby pins which he remembered seeing Dorothy wear as a child, that were stuck into the blue-and-white satin pin-cushion under the looking-glass.  He examined all her books, the pictures on the walls, and studied the photographs of her friends and schoolmates, of which she had many.  Now and then he would softly touch and caress a vase or an ornament with reverent, trembling fingers.  A little workbasket, made of sweet grass, and sending its delicate perfume to his nostrils, stood upon a table, and some great tears splashed into it as he bent over it and noted a small silver thimble lying among its other implements.  When he came to the pretty brass bed, with its dainty lace spread and shams, he seemed almost overcome.  His head sank heavily upon his breast, and, reaching out a trembling hand, he gently patted one of the pillows, a great sob heaving his chest and shaking his entire frame as he did so. Then, with a gesture of despair that seemed also to imply the renunciation of some previous purpose, he turned abruptly away, and went back to a group of photographs fastened to the wall, where he had noticed a likeness of Dorothy.  It was a class picture that had been taken of her in her graduating dress, just before leaving Vassar.  The man studied it intently, his hungry, yearning eyes devouring its every detail.  At last, with a stealthy glance over his shoulder, he reached up, took it down, pressed it passionately to his lips; then, hastily concealing it inside his coat, he left the room.  He merely glanced into the pretty dining room beyond, without attempting to go farther, after which he slowly retraced his steps through the hall to the reception room, and paused in the doorway leading to the parlor, where Helen was still sitting.  ""I am going now, Helen,"" he observed, in a spiritless tone.  ""Thank you for letting me look around.""  She rose and went toward him.  He was standing where the light fell full upon his face, and she was shocked to see how ghastly and ill he looked.  ""Where are you going?"" she briefly inquired.  ""I don't quite--know; I----""  ""How did you find me?""  ""You didn't think I would lose sight of you, did you, after once getting a glimpse of you?  I had to know something about Dorothy; I couldn't stand it--the silence and the uncertainty--any longer.""  ""You will not come here again?""  There was a note of blended authority and appeal in Helen's tone.  ""No, I will never trouble you again.  I don't think I'll trouble anybody long,"" he said grimly.  ""But, Helen""--a scarlet streak shot vividly across his forehead--""could you let me have a little money?  I have only a few cents, and I haven't had anything to eat since----""  He broke off suddenly, and began to cough distressingly, his head bowed low in humiliation because of his destitution.  Helen's heart bounded into her throat.  John Hungerford hungry--begging for something to eat!  The epicure, the prodigal, who, in days gone by, had never denied himself any luxury that he had craved, now absolutely penniless and shabby, almost starving!  And that cough--how it racked him!  A thrill of horror ran through her; she clenched her hands in an effort to repress the cry of dismay that arose to her lips.  ""Where are you staying?"" she forced herself to inquire, with an appearance of composure.  ""I don't know where I shall stay to-night,"" he faltered.  ""To-morrow I am going back to San Francisco; Uncle Nathan has sent me a ticket.""  So he had not even a place to lay his head that night, and the few cents which he claimed to have surely would not provide him the humblest lodging, let alone something to appease his hunger.  ""Wait,"" said Helen, and, turning abruptly from him, a choking sensation in her throat, she swept into the library.  Going to her desk, she wrote a few words upon a blank card, after which she opened a drawer, drew forth a crisp new bank note, and hastily folded it, with the numerals out of sight.  She then returned to the hall, and slipped the card, with the money underneath, into the man's hand.  ""Here is the address of a good woman who sometimes works for me,"" she said.  ""She lives not far from here; take the first turn to the right, going downtown; the third street from there is Broad Street.  Turn to your left, find number ninety-five, and Mrs. Harding lives on the lower floor.  She will give you a comfortable room for the night and a good breakfast in the morning.""  As she concluded, Helen turned the catch and opened the door leading to the outer hall.  She was trembling violently, and her face was as colorless as marble.  John Hungerford stood for a moment, regarding her with a hopeless, heartbroken look; then, with bowed head and faltering steps, he passed out upon the landing.  ""Thank you; good-by--Helen,"" he breathed hoarsely.  ""Good-by, John,"" she mechanically returned, and the door was shut between them.  She stood listening until she heard him leave the house.  Then, after carefully fastening the burglar chain, she staggered to her chamber, where, falling face downward upon her bed, she collapsed in violent hysterics.  ""Oh, if it were only a horrible dream from which I could wake!"" she moaned.  ""It cannot--cannot be possible that I have seen him again, and in such a miserable plight!""  How would it all end? she wondered, as she lay there in abject misery. Would the shameful past, which she had believed forever annihilated, by the death of Marie Duncan and the destruction of those menacing newspapers and photographs, be resurrected, and the fair fabric of social prestige, almost of celebrity, which she had reared for herself and her child during the last ten years be ruthlessly overthrown, and crush them both to earth beneath the ruins?  She had firmly believed for many years that she would never again meet the faithless man who had once been her husband.  She had fondly imagined that she was absolutely free to live out the beautiful future she had grown to anticipate without once having her peace disturbed by any fear that he would ever cross her path again.  But, alas, for the frailty of human hopes!  To be sure, he had told her that he would never trouble her again, and there had been a hopeless finality in both his manner and words when he left her to-night, that seemed convincing. But would he keep his word?  Would he--oh, would he?  And to what depths he had fallen!  Could that homeless, penniless, pitiful tramp be the once light-hearted, care-free John Hungerford?  The man who had been her husband, and in whose companionship she had once believed herself to be supremely happy!  And now--she cringed with shame and repugnance at the mere remembrance of his presence.  How could he ever have sunk so low?  Ah, she knew but too well!  He had always depended upon some one else to make life easy for him, to help him over hard places, to care for his comfort, and cater to his entertainment; while he gathered only the honey along the way, shirking every manly duty, ignoring every sacred responsibility; and when his props, one by one, had fallen away from him, he had drifted aimlessly and helplessly with the current, sinking lower and lower, until, ill, hungry, and desperate, he had--as a last shameless resort--turned to her, his divorced wife, for help.  Helen spent a wretched night.  To sleep was impossible, with that gaunt figure, haggard face, and racking cough continually haunting her. Again and again she wished that she had given John twenty, instead of ten, dollars.  How was he ever to get to California with any degree of comfort upon so small a sum?  He certainly could not take a sleeper; he would have to ride all the way in a day coach, or go hungry--unless, perchance, his uncle had also sent him a ticket for a berth, which was doubtful.  And what would become of him upon reaching San Francisco? He did not look fit for work, and she knew well, from past experience, that Nathan Young was not likely to tolerate laggards in his employ.  What possible hope could the future hold for him--sick, spiritless, and with not a friend in the world to really care what became of him?  She shivered as a vision of the home for the poor arose before her.  Would he be driven to that?  Or, something even worse, perhaps--the coward's refuge--suicide?  These were some of the distracting thoughts that thronged her brain and drove sleep from her pillow during that long night.  At the same time she was greatly relieved to know that the continent would separate them.  He had promised that he would never trouble her again, and if he kept his word he would be gone to-morrow, and Dorothy need never know aught of this night's dreadful experience.  Somewhat calmed by these reflections, she finally, just as day began to dawn, dropped into a profound slumber, from which she did not awaken until nearly ten in the morning.  Fortunately it was Saturday; she had no pupils for that day, and her time was her own.  But she was far from happy as she tried to busy herself with some light duties about the house.  Her thoughts constantly reverted to her interview with John, and a sense of self-condemnation began to fasten itself upon her, in view of the attitude she had maintained toward him.  She knew that she had not been kind to him; she had flung scorn and taunts at him when he was already crushed beneath a heartrending load of misery and shame.  She had manifested antagonism, bitterness, and resentment toward him.  These, summed up, meant hate, and hate meant--what?  ""He that hateth his brother is a murderer,"" was the text that came to her again with a revolting shock, in reply.  John had implied that perhaps she had wished him dead.  She knew, now, that she had, and involuntarily she passed her hand across her forehead as she thought of that old-time brand upon the brow of Cain.  Had she fallen so low as that?  Had she been simply a whited sepulcher all these years, showing an attractive, gracious, irreproachable surface to the world, while in her heart she had been nursing this deadly viper, hate? John had deeply wronged her, but he had wronged himself far more, and now his sins had brought their own punishment--had stripped and left him wounded by the wayside; while she, instead of binding up his wounds, pouring in the oil of kindness and the wine of cheer and good will, had smitten him afresh.  Surely she would not have treated the veriest stranger like that!  True, she had given him money, but how had she given it--what had been the motive?  She knew it had been merely to get rid of him and to save herself the pain of thinking of him as a starving man.  All this was something similar to, though more effective than, the sifting she had experienced that never-to-be-forgotten Sunday in church, so long ago.  She realized now that she had not rooted out, but simply buried a little deeper, for the time being, the corroding bitterness within her heart.  Her interest in Marie Duncan, the kindness and sympathy she had shown her during her last hours, the change in her own and in the woman's mental attitude toward each other, together with Marie's surrender of the menacing newspapers and photographs, which had eliminated all fear of exposure, had brought to her a deceptive peace, which she had believed to be a purified conscience.  But the test that had come to her now proved to her that the serpent had only been sleeping, that she still had her battle to fight, her victory to win, or the evil would recoil upon herself, warp her nature, and poison her whole future.  It was a season of sackcloth and ashes for Helen, but the searching introspection to which she subjected herself had uncovered the appalling effects which long years of secret brooding, self-pity, and self-righteousness had produced upon her, and awakened a wholesome sense of self-condemnation and repentance, thus opening the way for a more healthful mental condition and growth.  She realized all this, in a way; but she did not know how to begin to tread down the conflicting forces that were rampant within her; how to silence the mental arguments that were continually affirming that she had been deeply wronged--that she might, perhaps, forgive, but could never forget; that John had made his own bed and must lie in it--he had no legal or moral right to expect either aid or sympathy from her--and so on to the end of the chapter--or, rather, the chapter seemed to have no end.  ""What shall I do?"" she finally exclaimed, with a feeling of exhaustion. ""The evil talks to me incessantly, and I do not know how to get the better of it.""  Suddenly she started from her chair, and, going to her desk, opened a drawer and found a card.  ""Mrs. Raymond B. Everleigh, number ---- Riverside Drive, New York,"" she read aloud, and then stood gravely thinking for a minute or two.  Then she opened her telephone book, found the name and address she wanted, and called the number opposite over the phone.  ""Is this Mrs. Raymond B. Everleigh?"" she inquired, when the connection had been made.  The answer came back: ""Yes, I am Mrs. Everleigh.""  ""Does Mrs. Everleigh remember the lady who sat with her in church the third Sunday in May, and to whom she gave her card, asking her to come again?"" Helen questioned.  ""Yes, indeed; and I have hoped to see her again--wondered why I have not.""  ""It is she who is talking with you now.  May I come to see you to-day? I know it is asking a great favor from a stranger, but----""  Helen's appealing voice ceased while she listened to something that came from the other end.  ""At two o'clock?  Oh, thank you!  I will be there,"" she gratefully returned, as she hung up her receiver and hastened to her room to dress for the street.     CHAPTER XVII.  AS WHEAT IS SIFTED.  At two o'clock Helen rang the bell of Mrs. Everleigh's palatial home on Riverside Drive.  A man in livery admitted her, swept herself and her card with a comprehensive glance as she laid the bit of pasteboard upon his tray, obsequiously bowed her into an elegantly appointed reception room, and disappeared.  Five minutes later Mrs. Everleigh came to her.  Helen had thought her a rarely beautiful woman when she had seen her in church, more than four months previous; but she seemed a hundredfold more lovely now, dressed all in simple white, her abundant snowy hair coiled becomingly about her head, her only ornament an exquisite chain of turquoise set in silver and almost the color of her peaceful eyes, and her lips wreathed in sunny, welcoming smiles.  ""Mrs. Ford, I am more than glad to see you,"" she said, as she cordially clasped Helen's hand.  ""And now, if you will allow me to waive the formalities of a first call, I am going to ask you to come up to my private sitting room, where we can be wholly by ourselves.""  Helen thanked her, and followed her up the grand stairway, noting the costly furnishings of the great hall, the rare paintings, statuary, bric-a-brac, et cetera, on every hand; and almost gave vent to an exclamation of childish delight as she was ushered into an exquisite boudoir on the second floor, and which was furnished throughout in blue and white; the great chandelier in the center of the ceiling, and other appliances for lighting, together with many beautiful vases, being all of crystal or expensive cut glass.  ""What an ideal setting for an ideal woman!"" she said to herself, as she entered the room.  ""Come and sit here, Mrs. Ford,"" said Mrs. Everleigh, as she preceded her to a great bow window, where there were two inviting rockers, with hassocks to match, a pretty onyx table on which rested a small easel supporting the photograph of a beautiful young girl, and, standing beside it, a costly cut-glass vase filled with fresh forget-me-nots.  ""What a lovely nook!"" was Helen's involuntary tribute, as she sank into the luxurious chair offered her.  ""And, oh, that view!"" she added, with a quick indrawn breath, as her glance fell upon the scene without, where, between splendid great trees, all glorious in their brilliant fall attire of red, yellow, and green, glimpses of the river, flashing in the sunlight, with the darker hills beyond, made a picture that one could never forget.  ""Yes, it is a scene of which I never tire,"" returned her hostess, as she took the other rocker, and thoughtfully pushed a hassock nearer her guest.  ""I hope, Mrs. Everleigh, I have not seemed intrusive in asking to come to you?"" Helen observed, after a moment or two, during which she sat silently drinking in the beauty before her.  ""But your kindness to me that day in church emboldened me to beg the favor.""  ""My dear, I am happy to have you come--I am glad to be helpful to any one, as opportunity offers,"" the elder lady graciously replied.  Helen lifted a glance of surprise to her.  She had not hinted that she was unhappy, or needed help of any kind.  Mrs. Everleigh met her look with her winning smile.  ""Your voice told me over the phone, dear, that you were in trouble,"" she said.  ""Now, open your heart to me.  What can I do for you?""  Her tone was so kind, her smile and manner so loving, Helen's forced composure melted like wax in the sun, and a sudden flood of tears rendered her utterly helpless to respond for the moment.  The strain and excitement of the last forty-eight hours had been very great, and the loss of two nights' sleep, together with the relentless mental vivisection to which she had since subjected herself, had robbed her of both strength and self-control.  ""Dear heart,"" gently entreated her companion, ""let the bitterness all out; then there will be room to pour in the balm and oil.""  She leaned back in her chair, and sat silent, with bowed head and averted eyes, until Helen's weeping ceased, and she began to regain something of her customary self-possession.  ""Dear Mrs. Everleigh,"" she at length said, as she lifted her tear-stained face to her, ""you have not attempted to question or comfort me, and yet it seems to me you have been pouring peace into my heart every moment since I came into this room; my trouble is the old puzzle regarding love and hate.""  ""How is it a puzzle?""  ""All my life,"" Helen explained, ""I have believed myself to be a good woman, a devoted wife and mother, faithful to my duties, charitable, conscientious, God-fearing, self-sacrificing to a fault, and absolutely loyal to my friends.  I believed all this to be love.  When trouble came, I bore it patiently, taking up my burdens with courage, and setting my face steadfastly toward the work of regaining for myself and my child that of which we had been cruelly robbed--home, position, and an honorable name.  I thought I had won, that the goal had been attained, that I had so firmly established myself no taint of the past could touch me; and I believed I was happy in what I had achieved, until I suddenly awoke to the fact that all the fair fabric I had constructed and believed unassailable was only an outward show, built upon pride and self-righteousness; until I began to realize that I had all the time been possessed of a subconscious hate, the hate that wishes people dead and powerless to cross your path again!  Does the picture appall you?""  Helen paused, almost breathless from inward emotion and rapid speaking.  ""My dear, you have uncovered all this in connection with yourself?"" gravely queried Mrs. Everleigh.  ""_Something_ has uncovered it,"" said Helen, with a bitter sigh.  ""And what is the result of such searching introspection?""  ""I feel like a whited sepulcher.  I am appalled, shocked beyond measure at myself,"" said Helen, with a gesture of repugnance.  ""Do you think it was your real self who was nursing all the evil you have portrayed?"" gently inquired her companion.  Helen lifted a look of surprise to her.  ""My real self?"" she repeated, in perplexity.  ""The real self is the purity--the innate consciousness that shrinks from evil, and would be clothed upon with the garment of righteousness, of right thinking and right living,"" said Mrs. Everleigh.  ""Then the evil-thinking is the unreal self, and every one possesses a dual nature?  I recognize that--it is the old story of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde--but when one wakes up to find that even the good he _thinks_ he has done is evil, because of the worm at the core, it becomes a mocking paradox,"" said Helen bitterly.  ""No, dear; not the good he thinks and has done,"" opposed her companion gently, ""for every good thought that has taken form in your consciousness, every good deed that has been the outgrowth of that thought, belongs to your true self, and nothing can rob you of it. Your efforts to conquer adverse circumstances, your determination to achieve success in your profession--I have recently heard Madam Ford sing, and have learned something of her career,"" the lady smilingly interposed--""and an honorable name and position for yourself and your child are all justifiable and praiseworthy.  We have a right to set our standards high and do our utmost, with right motives, to attain them. But the undercurrent of bitterness, the sense of resentment, self-pity, self-righteousness--the thinking that is continually arguing about the faults and sins of the wrongdoer--everything that tends to self-justification by the condemnation of another is all wrong, and must be put out, if we hope ever to attain to our ideals, and know real peace of mind.  It matters not how fair our outward living may seem, if the thinking is wrong.""  ""I began to realize something of this, that Sunday in church,"" said Helen.  ""It seemed as if a wonderful searchlight had been turned upon my inner self, revealing lurking demons I never dreamed I was harboring.""  ""Every one, sooner or later, must be sifted as wheat is sifted--must be refined as gold is refined; the dross and the chaff must be cast out,"" said her companion.  ""Oh, tell me how!"" Helen exclaimed.  ""One yearns to be pure in thought as well as in deed, but the wrong-thinking seems to go on and on of itself.  How can it be conquered?""  ""By putting self out of sight and giving loving service to others.""  ""To those who have done us desperate wrong?"" panted Helen, with an inward shock.  ""Even to those,"" said Mrs. Everleigh gently.  ""They need it most of all.""  ""Oh, you cannot mean that we should take them back into our hearts and lives, and nourish and serve them again as if no wrong had been done, when every law of God and man had been violated, every tendril of affection ruthlessly trampled upon!""  Helen's voice was almost inaudible as she concluded.  Mrs. Everleigh did not immediately reply; she sat gravely thinking for several minutes.  ""Dear Mrs. Ford,"" she at length began, ""we each have different problems in life to solve, and it is difficult and perhaps unwise for one to say to another what he or she would do under certain circumstances which had never come into one's own experience.  Loving service is that which best promotes the welfare of the one served.  What might be loving service and helpful for one might be just the reverse for another.  The wrongdoer must suffer for his wrongdoing, else he would never recognize or repent his sin; it would be doing irreparable injury to remove his punishment, restoring joys he had forfeited, privileges he had trampled upon.  That would be encouraging sin.  We are commanded to 'cast not our pearls before swine.'  We must not continue to shower blessings and favors indiscriminately upon those who have shown themselves unappreciative and unworthy of past benefits.  Having cut themselves adrift, it is theirs to work out their own salvation, and it is not our duty to again put ourselves in contact with the error that has deliberately wronged and wounded us.  And yet, there is loving service that we can still render even these; we can think and speak kindly of them, giving honor where honor is due, compassion instead of condemnation for the errors that hold them in bondage.  Such an attitude cannot fail to crowd out and conquer the bitterness, self-pity, self-righteousness, condemnation--everything that robs us of our peace.  When we attain to this we shall know that we have no partnership with hate.""  ""I begin to understand something of what love means,"" Helen said, in a tone of awe.  ""I feel as if I were just beginning to see how to live. You surely have helped me to empty myself of much of the evil that seemed to be surging within me when I came here this afternoon.  You have indeed 'poured in balm and oil,' and given me much food for thought.""  She arose to leave as she spoke, holding out her hand, a look of grateful appreciation in her eyes.  ""Oh, I am not going to let you go yet!  I have not said half I wish,"" cried her hostess, clasping her extended hand, but forcing her gently back into her chair; and Helen, eager to learn more from the wisdom that fell from her lips, sank restfully down among her cushions again, and they talked on for an hour longer.  ""How glad I am you came to me, Mrs. Ford!"" Mrs. Everleigh observed, when she finally said she must go.  ""I hope to see you often after this--I shall make it my way to do so, if you will allow me.  I heard you sing at the Wardsworths' shortly after we met in church, and I intended to be introduced to you at that time, but you had left when I asked to be presented.  You have a great gift, and I am going to beg you to use it for me some time.""  ""It will give me great pleasure to do so, Mrs. Everleigh.  I would love to show some appreciation of the good you have done me to-day,"" Helen heartily responded, adding, as her eyes sought those of her companion: ""It is a privilege just to look into your peaceful face--one would think that no blight or sorrow had ever touched you in----""  Mrs. Everleigh's hand closed over Helen's almost spasmodically, and her lips whitened suddenly, as her glance sought the beautiful photograph resting on the onyx table beside the vase of forget-me-nots.  ""No blight--no sorrow!"" she repeated, as she gently drew her visitor a step nearer the likeness.  ""Oh, no one escapes the tragedies of this mortal life, my dear--they pass none of us by.  This is a likeness of my daughter.  Is she not beautiful?  She was swept from my sight almost before I realized she was in danger.  It seemed as if a whirlwind caught her away, and--she was all I had--the apple of my eye, the one darling of my heart.  The blow left me with this crown of snow,"" she went on, touching with tremulous fingers the hair upon her forehead. ""It broke my heart, crushed me to earth for the time being, and the battle I had to fight was much the same that you are fighting now.  It is only step by step that we conquer in such experiences, but if we are sincere--'honest in mind and intention'--if we keep our armor on, and wield a merciless sword upon our secret foes, we must win in the end.""  Helen was very near weeping again as she listened to her.  Surely, she thought, the tragedies of earth pass no one by!  Those in palace and hovel meet on common ground in these great heart sorrows.  She lifted the hand she held, and softly laid her lips against it--she was powerless to speak one word.  But Mrs. Everleigh quickly quelled her momentary emotion, and her peaceful smile seemed like a benediction as she turned again to Helen.  ""But she made my life very bright while she was here.  I have beautiful things to remember of her; I have very much to be grateful for,"" she said bravely.  ""We must not forget to number our blessings, dear Mrs. Ford,"" she continued gravely, ""lest we drift back into the former bitterness and darkness.  You still have your lovely daughter, if you have had other trials--I saw her also at the Wardsworths'--be thankful, and, in the light of that and other blessings, forget the wrong and blight of the past.""  They went downstairs together, Mrs. Everleigh accompanying her visitor to the door and exacting a promise that she would come again in the near future, for there was more she wished to say to her when the world seemed brighter to her.  Helen went home with a sense of peace in her heart such as she had not known for many weeks.  She felt like a different person from what she had been during the last forty-eight hours.  She reviewed every step of her interview with Mrs. Everleigh, analyzing her arguments, making a personal application of them, and seeking to attain to a higher understanding of them.  ""Loving service for even those who have wronged us most!""  This had impressed her more deeply than anything else she had said, and as she conned it o'er and o'er she came to see that to purify her own consciousness of evil-thinking against John--he who had wronged her most, who had put the worst possible humiliation and suffering upon her--would not only release her from the intolerable bondage of mental discord which she had suffered for years whenever he had come into her thought, but would also be obeying the divine command: ""Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you.""  She might never see or hear from John again--she hoped she would not; he had said he would trouble her no more; but whether he did or not, she knew that the bitterness of hate was past, and in its place there was dawning a peace that comes to all those who realize and practice the greatest of all virtues--""Charity, the love that thinketh no evil.""     CHAPTER XVIII.  LOVING SERVICE.  When Helen entered the vestibule to the Grenoble, where she lived, on her return from her visit to Mrs. Everleigh, she found Mrs. Harding, to whom she had sent John the night before, in the vestibule, just about to ring her bell, and knew instantly, from the woman's face, that something had gone wrong.  ""What is it?"" she inquired, with quickened pulses.  ""You sent a man--Mr. Williams--to me last night?""  ""Yes.""  Helen was touched by the fact that John had taken pains to conceal his identity by giving his middle name to the woman.  He had been taken ill in the night, Mrs. Harding told her, and she had found him delirious in the morning.  She had sent for a physician--Doctor Wing--who seemed to think the case critical, and wanted him taken to some hospital, where he could have better air, and a constant attendant; but, Mrs. Harding explained, she felt she ought to come and talk with madam before consenting to the move.  ""That was right,"" observed Helen, who had been thinking rapidly while the woman was talking.  ""I knew Mr.--Williams years ago in San Francisco, and I am sure his friends would not wish him sent to a hospital.  He told me he intended to start for California to-day--he had his ticket--so his friends will be looking for him next week.""  ""Well, marm, it is my opinion that he'll never see San Francisco again,"" said the woman, with a grave shake of her head.  ""Oh!"" cried Helen sharply; ""is he as ill as that?""  Was John going to die, after all?  She was shocked through and through at the thought.  No, he must not--he should not!  She could never forgive herself for the dreadful things she had thought and said the night before, if he did.  Had her repentance come too late?  Was she to have no opportunity to prove the sincerity of her desire to put into practice the higher interpretation of love to which she was beginning to awake?  ""He's an awful sick man, marm,"" her companion replied.  ""When will Doctor Wing go to see him again?""  ""He said he'd drop in about six o'clock.""  ""Then I will be there at six, also; I wish to talk with Doctor Wing,"" Helen observed, and Mrs. Harding, anxious to get back to her charge, but evidently relieved to have her responsibility shared, went her way.  When Helen had leased her apartment at the Grenoble, she had hired another smaller suite of two rooms and bath, adjoining, and running at right angles with it.  These she had fitted up attractively as a studio, where she gave her lessons and prepared for her social engagements, thus leaving her apartment free for Dorrie to entertain her friends whenever she wished.  At her request, her landlord had cut a door between the suites, and this arrangement had enabled her to go back and forth without being obliged to pass through the public hall.  While talking with Mrs. Harding she had conceived a plan to meet Doctor Wing's desire for better air and good care for his patient.  She would put a bed and other comforts in the larger room of the studio.  Mrs. Harding was a good, sensible, reliable woman, capable in every way--and she would engage her and a trained nurse, if necessary, to take care of the invalid.  John should have every possible chance for his life that she could give him, and perhaps this would blot out that dreadful suspicion he had voiced that she had wished him out of the way.  She unfolded this plan to Doctor Wing when she went to Mrs. Harding's to meet him, at six o'clock, and, the physician cordially approving it, in less than three hours the sick man was transferred to Helen's cheerful, well-ventilated rooms, with good Mrs. Harding as nurse and attendant.  The woman said she would prefer to take care of him alone; she believed she could do it, and it would be much easier for her than to be subjected to the red tape and rigid rules of a trained nurse.  Helen seconded this proposition, saying she, too, would do whatever she was able, and would stand ready to provide a trained nurse at any moment, if the plan did not work to Doctor Wing's entire satisfaction.  The physician gave his consent somewhat reluctantly, but said they would try it for a day or two.  He was somewhat at a loss to understand Madam Ford's interest in the man, even though she had frankly explained that she had known both him and his family when, years ago, she also had lived in San Francisco.  However, it was no affair of his, only so far as it made better conditions for his patient; the rooms she offered were certainly more desirable than a cot in the public ward of a hospital would be, and madam, if she were doing this simply because of a friendly interest in him and his far-off family, was a rare woman, indeed.  For two weeks it seemed a doubtful battle for the sick man, who was delirious and entirely unconscious of his condition and surroundings; but at the end of that time he began slowly to mend, although he manifested very little interest in the fact, obediently submitting to whatever was done or prescribed for him, but with a feeble air of protest that was discouraging to those interested in him.  ""He doesn't want to get well,"" Mrs. Harding told the physician, when he came one morning and found his patient very weak and unresponsive to his cheerful greeting.  ""I know it, poor fellow!"" he gravely replied.  ""But we will do the best we can for him, although it looks as if that 'best' will not keep him here very long.""  ""Where am I?"" John asked his nurse a few days later.  ""Is this a hospital?""  ""No, it is a small suite,"" she told him.  ""Some one who was not going to occupy it for a while offered the use of it to Doctor Wing, so he brought you here and engaged me to take care of you.""  Helen had insisted that her agency in the matter was not to be known--at least, not at present, and when John came to himself she withdrew from the rooms altogether.  ""A man does not like to be under obligations to a woman,"" she had said, ""and doubtless we shall soon hear from his friends, who will then assume the care of him.""  But John, as he slowly improved, in spite of his indifference to life, appeared intuitively to realize that he was not wholly indebted to the good doctor for the comforts he was enjoying.  The rooms were handsomely furnished; there were dainty and womanly touches all around him that somehow suggested a familiar atmosphere; the bed linen and towels were fine and heavy; a rich, warm-hued dressing robe and nice underwear had been provided for him, and, with the artistic tray on which his food was served, the pretty hand-painted china, and bright flowers in unique vases, besides many luxuries to tempt his appetite, all betrayed a thoughtful interest that strangers, or a strange doctor, would hardly bestow upon one so destitute as himself.  He talked very little with either his physician or Mrs. Harding; asked no questions, yet was always appreciative of any service rendered him. By the end of four weeks he was able to sit up in a great easy-chair by a sunny window, where he would remain as long as was permitted, sometimes sitting with closed eyes, apparently thinking; at others manifesting a trifle more interest than heretofore by studying the surrounding buildings and his rooms.  He was now allowed to have a daily paper to look over, and Doctor Wing tried to draw him out on current events and other subjects, now and then telling a pleasant story or a piquant joke; but while John was always most courteous in his bearing and conversation he could hardly be said to be responsive to these efforts in his behalf.  One day there came a tap on the door leading into Helen's apartment. John caught the sound, although the door of the room he was in was partially closed.  Mrs. Harding answered the summons, there followed a few low-spoken words, and presently the woman returned, bearing in her hands a basket of luscious fruit, a few fragrant flowers carelessly scattered over it.  ""Where did you get it?"" the man inquired, his face lighting with pleasure at the attractive offering.  It was the first really spontaneous sign of interest he had manifested.  ""A lady who lives in the next suite sent it in to you,"" Mrs. Harding explained, as she laid a tempting peach, with a bunch of grapes, upon a plate and passed it to him.  John sat suddenly erect, exhibiting an energy which betrayed to Mrs. Harding that he possessed more strength than she had supposed.  He flushed a hot crimson, glanced alertly out of the window near him, then at the door leading into the hall, through which the doctor usually entered.  He next set his plate upon a small table beside him, arose, and went to another window, where he stood for several minutes, studying the surroundings outside.  Presently he returned to his chair and his fruit, a wan smile curling his lips, for between certain suspicions that had beset him of late and a rather accurate bump of location he had gotten his bearings at last, and thought he knew where he was.  ""Mrs. Harding, this house is the Grenoble, is it not?"" he quietly inquired, as he began to pare his peach, but with hands that trembled in spite of his efforts to conceal his excitement.  ""Um--yes,"" she replied, with some reluctance.  ""And Madam Ford lives in the adjoining suite, does she not?  It was she who sent me the fruit?""  ""You know, Mrs. Harding, it was Madam Ford who sent me to you the night I was taken ill,"" John resumed, in a matter-of-fact tone, without appearing to observe her confusion.  ""I would be glad to see her again; will you ask her if she will spare me a few moments?""  On receiving this message, Helen knew that she could no longer keep out of sight; she had realized from the first that the truth would have to be revealed sooner or later, and she went to him at once, greeting him courteously, as if he had been simply an old acquaintance.  ""Helen, you are responsible for my being here.  Why did you do this?"" he exclaimed huskily, as the nurse left the room, closing the door after her.  ""If this is what you wished to see me about I am not going to stay, for you are not to get excited,"" Helen returned reprovingly; then she added kindly: ""There was simply nothing else to do.""  ""Yes, there was; you could have let them take me to some hospital, where they would have put me to die, like any other beggar.  Why didn't you?"" he demanded bitterly.  ""Because, for one reason, Doctor Wing thought this the better plan for you----""  ""But the expense of it!"" he interposed, flushing hotly.  ""To say nothing about the imposition on you.""  ""Oh, don't let that trouble you,"" said Helen calmly.  ""Of course, I wrote to your uncle, telling him of your illness.  I thought he would be wondering, after sending you the ticket, why you did not put in an appearance at San Francisco.""  ""Well, what did he say?""  ""He wrote me to see that you were made comfortable, and sent me some money.""  ""How much?""  ""Fifty dollars,"" Helen confessed, rather reluctantly.  A cynical smile curled John Hungerford's lips.  ""Fifty dollars!  It has cost you many times that to provide for my needs, and the care I have had, to say nothing about the doctor's bill,"" he faltered.  ""Well""--with a reckless air--""I shall soon be where I will trouble no one, and--I am glad of it.""  ""Why should you be glad of it?"" Helen gravely asked.  ""Because I do not wish to be a burden to any one.  I've been a failure from beginning to end, and I am weary of the race.  Even if I were not, I know my fate is settled, and it would be useless to try to change it.""  ""How do you know your fate is settled, as you express it?""  He held up a trembling, transparent hand.  ""I have no blood; I have no strength, no courage, nothing to look forward to,"" he said, in a hopeless tone.  ""Don't you think it would be more brave if, instead of yielding to such gloomy thoughts, you made an effort to get well?"" Helen gently suggested.  ""What for?  _What_ have I to live for?"" he cried, lifting agonized eyes to her.  ""For the sake of trying to live--_right_ for a while,"" she gravely but very kindly replied.  A wave of scarlet shot over his wan face, and his head fell upon his breast.  ""By Heaven, I wish I could!"" he exclaimed, looking up, after a moment, a ring of sincerity in his voice that Helen had never heard before.  ""Then, John, why not make an honest effort for it?""  And Helen's tone was full of strength and encouragement.  ""It is too late--I am not going to get well.  I am sure the doctor thinks I cannot,"" he wearily returned.  ""Simply because you have no wish to, and will not try; your own attitude is what is sending you to your doom.  Don't let this inertia conquer you, John; buckle on your courage, take a fresh grip on hope, and rise above this weakness.  There is hardly any situation in life so adverse that it cannot be overcome if one will go to work the right way.  Then, think of your talent--it was a divine gift.  Can you bear the thought of making no return for it--of leaving absolutely nothing behind you to show that John Hungerford, who was born with the soul of a great artist--you know, Monsieur Jacques told you that--ever lived? Oh, rouse yourself; start out anew, and make your mark in the world!""  Helen had spoken very earnestly, and it was evident that her words had made a deep impression upon her listener, for it was with difficulty that he preserved his composure.  ""Do you think I can--now, after all the best of my life has been wasted?"" he breathed eagerly, but swallowing hard to keep back a sob that almost got the better of him.  ""I am sure you can,"" she cheerily responded.  ""Make up your mind, first of all, that you are going to get well; that will be half of the battle won; and, with health and strength regained, the rest will be comparatively easy.  I wish----""  She paused suddenly, as if in doubt of the wisdom of what she had been about to say.  ""What do you wish?"" he inquired, as he keenly searched her thoughtful face.  ""I wish you would allow me to bring a dear friend to see you--some one whom I feel sure would be a great help to you.""  ""Who is this friend?"" John demanded, almost sharply, and with suddenly averted face.  ""A Mrs. Everleigh--the purest, sweetest woman I have ever known.""  ""Oh!""  A great fear seemed to vanish as the man breathed the one word; but Helen, busy with her own thoughts, did not appear to heed him.  ""Does she know----"" he began again, after a moment, and then faltered, a hot flush mounting to his forehead.  ""She knows nothing, except that a Mr. Williams, whom I once knew in California, has been very ill here at the Grenoble, and I, as a neighbor, have been interested in him,"" Helen assured him.  During the four weeks of John's illness she had seen Mrs. Everleigh three times; once her new friend had come to see her, and twice she had been to her, and a strong affection had sprung up between them.  Helen had been so benefited and uplifted by the woman's higher thought and its practical application to daily living, it had occurred to her that if she could bring John under her influence he might be inspired to desire a new lease of life, and to try to redeem his past.  She had told her new friend of John, and of his sickness--had intimated, as she said, that she had known him years ago in her old home, San Francisco.  She gave her some idea of his great talent, and how he had wasted it; but she had not mentioned the fact that he had once been her husband, and the author of her own troubles, or that he was under any obligation to her for the care and comforts he had received during his illness.  ""Why do you wish me to meet this Mrs. Everleigh?"" John inquired, after silently considering the proposition for several moments.  ""I want you to know this grand woman.  She will do you good; she will inspire you to take a different view--to have a better understanding--of life and its obligations,"" was Helen's earnest response.  ""She will not preach to you,"" she hastened to add, as she saw an uneasy look flit over his face.  ""She is no officious missionary, going about trying to reform the world at large, and I shall simply introduce her to you as a friend whom I thought it would be pleasant for you to meet after being shut up here for so long, and----  Well, I am sure you will find her irresistible.""  A smile, half of amusement, half of skepticism, curled her listener's pale lips.  ""You have certainly aroused my curiosity, and you may bring your friend whenever you see fit,"" he observed, but more to please Helen than because he felt any special desire to meet her paragon of excellence.  ""Let me say you have a rare treat in store,"" she returned, adding, as he manifested signs of weariness: ""But you must not talk more now; try to rest and think cheerful thoughts, and you will be stronger to-morrow.""  She arose as she concluded, and, with a kindly good-by, quietly left the room.     CHAPTER XIX.  JOHN HUNGERFORD BEGINS LIFE ANEW.  John was not as well the following day, and the new impulse with which Helen's visit of the previous day had inspired him seemed to have lost its grip upon him, while all his former listlessness and indifference to life returned.  Previous to her call, Helen had interviewed Doctor Wing regarding the condition of his patient, and he had told her that, while the crisis appeared to have been well passed, and there were indications that he might rally for a time, he had grave doubts regarding his ultimate recovery; for, aside from certain threatening conditions, the man was laboring under great mental depression, and appeared to have no desire to live, which, of itself, was by no means an encouraging phase. Consequently she had not been wholly unprepared for John's own admission that he was glad he was not going to get well.  But since her acquaintance with Mrs. Everleigh, Helen's views regarding many things pertaining to life had radically changed.  She did not believe that John's case was hopeless, notwithstanding the unfavorable outlook, and she resolved that he should be saved--he should have another chance to prove himself a man, and a great artist, if there was any power that could save him; and she felt assured there was.  She went immediately to her friend, to whom she explained the situation, and Mrs. Everleigh promised to go to see ""Mr. Williams"" the following day.  She came late in the morning, when, refreshed by a good night's rest, he was feeling much brighter and stronger than on the previous day. And the moment he heard her speak, and looked into her eyes, he knew that all Helen had said of her was true.  She was a brilliant as well as a beautiful woman, for, aside from having been finely educated, she had always enjoyed rare social advantages.  There was also a merry vein in her nature, and she had not been many minutes in his presence before John found himself laughing out spontaneously over her vivid description of a ludicrous incident that had occurred on her way to the Grenoble to see him.  This set him immediately at his ease with her, and they dropped into a free and interesting discussion of various topics that lasted for nearly an hour.  When Mrs. Everleigh finally arose to go she observed, with charming cordiality:  ""I have enjoyed my call so much, Mr. Williams, I am coming again soon, if you will allow me.""  ""You are very kind, Mrs. Everleigh, and I assure you it will give me great pleasure to have you do so,"" he replied, with all the old-time courtesy of the once elegant John Hungerford.  ""And I will send my car around for you as soon as you feel strong enough for a drive,"" the lady continued brightly.  ""You need to get out into this crisp fall air, and before long you will feel like a new man; the world will seem like a different place to you.""  John's face fell suddenly.  Until this moment he had not once thought of himself since her coming.  ""I fear that will never be,"" he said, in a spiritless tone.  ""There are strong indications that before very long I may be in a different world from this.""  ""Who has dared to pass such sentence upon you, Mr. Williams?"" gravely questioned his companion.  ""Put that thought away from you at once; it is your rightful heritage to be a strong, well man, and--you still have work to do here.""  Then she smiled cheerily into his face as she held out her hand to take leave of him, adding: ""But we will talk more of that when I come again.""  And she went away, leaving John with a sense of something new having been born into his consciousness.  He walked to a window, and stood looking thoughtfully out over the roofs and chimney pots, while a voice within him, that seemed almost audible, repeated over and over: ""It is your rightful heritage to be a strong, well man; and you still have work to do _here_.""  That same evening, the duties of the day being over, Helen went in to see him again, and to inform him that she had received a second letter from his uncle, Mr. Young, who had sent her another check for fifty dollars, which she laid before him as she spoke.  He pushed it almost rudely from him.  ""Keep it,"" he said, flushing sensitively; ""I cannot take it.""  She appeared to heed neither his act nor his words, but casually inquired, while she observed that he looked better and brighter than when she last saw him:  ""Where is your painting outfit, John?""  ""Sold at auction, I imagine,"" he replied; then continued, with painful embarrassment: ""I may as well tell you exactly how matters stand with me.  Marie left me--that is, we had a final falling out--more than three years ago.  She immediately broke camp, sold off everything--even my kit--and cleared out; went West and got her bill from me, and I've drifted about ever since.  We didn't have a very happy time together, and I----""  ""You need not tell me any more,"" Helen here abruptly interposed. ""Forget it, if you can.""  ""Oh, Helen,"" he burst forth, with exceeding bitterness, ""I wish I _could_ forget it!  I wish I could wake up to find these last ten years only a miserable nightmare!""  ""I think you are waking up from a very bad dream, John,"" she returned, in a friendly tone.  ""You are looking decidedly better, and it rests a good deal with yourself whether you continue to improve.""  ""Marie is dead--was killed, or, rather, fatally injured, and died in the Mercy Hospital a few months ago,"" resumed John, not to be diverted from what he had been saying.  ""I did not learn of it until it was all over, or I would have gone to----""  ""Yes, I know; I read of the accident,"" Helen again broke in upon him, and somewhat startled to learn that he had been in New York at that time.  But she felt that she could not discuss that chapter of his life with him.  Her chief desire now was to start him upon the right road to redeem his past, if that were possible; then leave him to work his own way to a more prosperous future.  ""Now, let there be no more looking back,"" she hastened to add; ""do not waste time in vain regrets over what is behind you, but keep your face steadfastly toward the light of the new day that is dawning upon you. You are really better--you are going to get well; you will take up your art again, and you will do something worth while.""  ""Upon my soul, I wish I might!"" he said, in a low, eager tone, and secretly encouraged by her positive assertions.  ""Then if you really wish it, suppose you begin at once,"" Helen proposed, with inspiring energy.  ""Take some of this money your uncle has sent, get what materials you need, and go to work, doing a little--what you are able--every day.  Make out a list of what you require, and I will place the order for you; here are pencil and paper. I will come for the memorandum directly after breakfast to-morrow morning, take it to Bronson's, have the things sent up immediately, and you can make a beginning before the day is out.""  She pushed some writing materials across the cable to him, and then arose to go.  The man lifted a wondering glance to her.  ""Helen, you are a marvel to me!  You have put new life into me,"" he said, with deep emotion.  ""I am simply overwhelmed by your goodness--I wonder that your heart is not filled with bitter hatred for me.""  Helen flushed consciously at his words, and moved away to the mantel, where she stood musing for a few minutes as she gazed down upon the glowing logs in the fireplace below.  How she had struggled with the demon of hate no one save herself would ever know.  But she had finally conquered her foe.  She knew she had, from the simple fact that she experienced only the feeling of satisfaction in knowing that John would get well--that she wanted him to get well; while she firmly believed that he would be a better man in the future for the helping hand she had given him and the interest she had manifested in him.  No, she no longer bore him the slightest ill will; instead of cherishing antagonism and resentment, she had come to regard him as her ""neighbor,"" a brother man, for whom she would do only as she would be done by; and, having once attained this attitude, a great burden of self-condemnation had rolled from her heart and left her at peace with him and the world.  ""No, John, I have no hatred for you,"" she at length gravely observed, but without turning toward him.  ""Once I--I could not have said this, but I have learned, through bitter experience, that hate harms the hater rather than the object of his hatred; that it corrodes, corrupts, and destroys him mentally, morally, and spiritually; and to-day I can truly say that I only wish you well--wish that you may grow strong, not only physically, but in every other higher and better sense of the word, and make for yourself a name and place in the world, that will compel all men to respect you.  I know you can do it, if you will.""  As she ceased she turned abruptly, and, with a low-voiced good night, slipped from the room before he could detain her.  The man sat motionless and absorbed in thought for a long time after she had gone.  Every word she had spoken had sunk deep into his consciousness, and had shown him, directly and indirectly, not only what she had overcome and suffered in her struggles with adverse circumstances, but how she had won the greatest battle of all--the conquest over self.  At last he lifted his bowed head, and revealed a face all aglow with a new and inspiring purpose; at the same time there was a look of keenest pain in his eyes.  ""I will do it!"" he breathed hoarsely.  ""But, good God, what a royal heart I have trampled beneath my feet!""  * * * * * * *  Three weeks later John Hungerford left the Grenoble apartments, a comparatively well man.  Meantime, having, through Helen's energetic efforts, obtained the necessary materials, he had labored industriously, and with a constantly growing interest, at his easel, gaining flesh and strength each day, while something seemed to be burning within him that he had never been conscious of before.  What was it? he wondered, with almost a feeling of awe--this ever-increasing energy of purpose, this resistless zeal, that was pushing him forward and lifting him above anything he had ever aspired to in the years long gone by?  Was it the soul of the great artist, in embryo, that at last was really beginning to expand in its effort to burst its long-imprisoning shackles and plume its wings for a lofty flight?  Mrs. Everleigh came to see him every few days, and her talks with him opened up broader vistas of life and its obligations, and imbued him with higher ideals and desires.  She insisted upon his going out every day, and frequently sent her car to take him out of the city for an invigorating drive in the country.  All this--the cheerful thought, the better purpose and outlook, together with the kind attentions of those interested in him--could not fail to develop faith and hope, with better physical conditions, also, and his improvement was rapid.  During this time he had completed two very attractive paintings, which, through the influence of his physician, were placed in a leading art store, and sold at a fair valuation--enough to enable him to begin business for himself, in a couple of inexpensive rooms in another part of the city, which, however, he intended only to be a stepping-stone to something better.  On the morning of his departure for his modest studio he did not look like the same man who, bowed and broken, had come to Helen's door a few weeks previous.  His form was erect, and had taken on a good coat of flesh; his eyes were clear and bright; his face, tinged with the glow of health, was full of hope, and his bearing characterized by a quiet dignity, and also by an unaccustomed energy that bespoke a definite purpose for the future.  An expressman had already taken away his boxes, and he had just sealed and was addressing a letter, when Doctor Wing dropped in to give him a friendly handshake and wish him all success in his new undertaking.  ""May only prosperity attend you, my friend,"" he said, when, after chatting a few minutes, he arose to leave and begin his daily round of visits; ""and, by the way, I have been sorry I didn't take one of those pictures that were sold at Arlington's the other day.  Duplicate that autumnal scene for me, will you?  Or make me something after the same style.""  John's lips quivered slightly as he received this, his first, order, and at the same time recognized the underlying motive that had prompted it.  ""With the greatest pleasure,"" he returned, his voice a trifle husky; ""and, doctor, I can only regard this as another kindness added to the many favors I have already received from you and shall always gratefully remember.""  Mrs. Everleigh made her appearance just at this moment, and her breezy greetings relieved the physician of the embarrassment he was beginning to experience, in view of John's expressions of gratitude, and he was glad to be saved the necessity of replying.  She had told John the previous day that she claimed the privilege of taking him downtown and installing him in his studio; she would call for him at eleven, and it was to keep this appointment that she now presented herself.  The whole-souled doctor and the lady had become very good friends during John's convalescence, for not infrequently they had met in his rooms, and now and then enjoyed a pleasant tilt at each other's expense regarding certain differences of opinion.  Upon this occasion her coming appeared to arouse afresh his spirit of jocosity, and they exchanged several glittering lances that put them all in a very merry frame of mind, which was a good thing, for John, not having seen Helen that morning, was somewhat depressed at the thought of going away without a few last words with her.  At length Doctor Wing broke off in the midst of a hearty laugh over a bright repartee from Mrs. Everleigh, saying, as he caught up his hat and gloves:  ""Well, this will not do for me, much as I dislike to tear myself away from such pleasant company; but I am culpably neglecting my duties. Mrs. Everleigh""--extending a cordial hand to her--""it has been a great pleasure to know you, and I am hoping that our acquaintance will not end here, even though""--the old roguish look again dancing in his eyes--""you certainly stole a very clever march upon me here.""  ""How so?"" she questioned, with an assumed air of innocence, but with an answering gleam of amusement, for she could not fail to understand what he meant.  ""Why, as you well know, I lost my patient the day you first appeared in this apartment,"" he returned, with mock severity.  Then he added, more gravely, and much to his listeners' surprise: ""And it is not my first or second experience of the kind, either, with you people.""  ""Do you regret those experiences, Doctor Wing?"" the lady gently inquired.  He hesitated an instant; then met her eyes squarely.  ""No, I do not,"" he frankly replied.  ""Honesty compels me to admit it, to confess that I have been exceedingly grateful for them, especially upon learning that the patient had been very quickly healed after changing practitioners--that a precious life had thus been saved, and I had escaped the most painful duty demanded of a physician.  I do not believe,"" he continued thoughtfully, ""that any conscientious physician, who had done his utmost to save life, has ever written the name of the patient he has lost upon a death certificate, and appended his own signature thereto, without experiencing a very depressing sense of the inadequacy of materia medica.""  Mrs. Everleigh had regarded the gentleman with mingled admiration and wonder while he was speaking.  ""Doctor Wing, you are a brave man!"" she heartily exclaimed, as he paused.  ""And allow me to add that I appreciate the very noble attitude you have revealed more than I can express.  I know of one other who, like you, having exhausted his resources in certain complicated cases, has even advised the patient to change the method of treatment, and quick healing has resulted.  I presume there are many more physicians just as conscientious and broad-minded, and I say all honor to such men.""  ""No doubt I would be severely censured by the majority of my profession for giving expression to such convictions,"" Doctor Wing continued, with a slight shrug of his shoulders; ""but I believe human judgment is not the highest tribunal to which man is answerable for either his deeds or opinions, and one must be true to the voice within if he would preserve his integrity and peace of mind, and not become a mere puppet.  Please do not misunderstand me,"" he interpolated, in lighter vein; ""I am not attempting to depreciate my own school, and I intend to stick to it until I am convinced that there is a better.  At the same time, there are existing conditions against which I, together with some of my colleagues, have the courage of my convictions, and am ready, if occasion requires, to take a radical stand.""  ""Such as what, please?--if you have the time to spare to tell me,"" said Mrs. Everleigh, who had listened to him with deep interest.  ""Well, in my opinion there should be absolute medical freedom, as well as absolute religious freedom,"" he replied.  ""No one school has any moral right to persecute or seek to overthrow any other school, or usurp authority to compel the public to submit to its method of treatment, any more than any special religious denomination has the right to wipe out other denominations, compel mankind to adopt its tenets and submit to its mode of baptism.  All men have equal rights--the right to say whether they will or will not have this or that remedy for their diseases; this or that doctrine to save their souls.  Any other attitude of class or government savors of bigotry and tyranny; any law to enforce such conditions would be a criminal infringement of man's moral and civil freedom, and a rank violation of the boasted principles of our Constitution.  I see by your shining eyes, my dear lady, that you fully agree with me upon these points,"" he concluded, with a chuckle of satisfaction, as he viewed her beaming face.  ""I certainly do, Doctor Wing--you are an advocate for justice after my own heart,"" Mrs. Everleigh heartily asserted.  ""And let me echo your words of a few moments ago: 'I hope our acquaintance will not end here.'""  ""Thank you, madam; and, since the desire appears to be mutual, we will see to it that it does not,"" he smilingly replied, as he bowed himself out.     CHAPTER XX.  FIVE YEARS LATER.  That evening, when Helen came home from a visit to Dorothy, who had recently returned from her trip, and was pleasantly settled in her new home, she found her ""neighbor"" gone.  Knowing that John was to leave that day, she had purposely planned to be away in order to save them both the embarrassment of a formal leave-taking.  She had seen him the previous evening, when they had merely referred to the contemplated change, and had parted with a simple ""good night.""  But John was not willing to leave her in any such unsatisfactory way, and when she reached home, after her day up the Hudson, she found the following note awaiting her:   HELEN: I could not go without some expression of gratitude for what you have done for me, and which you persistently avoided last night. Through your divine charity, I am going out from this place, not only in perfect health, but a new man, mentally and morally.  When I look back----  But you have told me there must be no looking back, no vain repining; I can see that is wise counsel, for I know that only by blotting out the terrible past can I remain steadfast in the new aspirations and purposes that have taken root in me since I have been a pensioner upon your bounty.  Words are inadequate to portray what I feel, in view of what I owe to you, and volumes of promises, unfulfilled, have no weight; but I am going to try to make my future attest the sincerity of my present determination to retrieve the past. The father within me yearns mightily for his child, but I know I am not yet worthy to claim her as such.  Some time, perchance, you may be willing to have her know that, after long years of starving among the husks and swine, the prodigal has come to himself, and is striving to redeem himself.  JOHN.   Helen's eyes were full of tears as she finished reading this note; but they were tears of thankfulness, in view of the fact that she had not, like the priest and Levite of old, ""passed by on the other side,"" and left the wanderer to his fate.  The lost had been found; the man had indeed become mentally and morally renewed, and she felt an absolute assurance that John Hungerford's name would yet rank high among those of other eminent artists of the world.  She had told Dorothy nothing regarding these recent experiences in connection with her father's sudden reappearance.  She had given much serious thought to the subject, for she wished to do right, to be just to both Dorothy and to John; but in whatever light she considered it, it did not seem wise that they be reunited at this time.  It was true that John seemed to have really ""come to himself, like the prodigal of old,"" as he had said; but she reasoned that it belonged to him to prove it.  His regret for the past appeared to be absolutely sincere; he was full of enthusiasm to begin life anew upon a higher basis, and to put into practice the promptings of an awakened conscience, together with the better knowledge he had recently gained regarding man's individual responsibilities.  But, as he had written her, ""volumes of promises unfulfilled have no weight,"" and until he could show himself able to stand alone it were better for both, perhaps, that he did not come into Dorothy's life.  She believed, too, that she owed it to Mr. Alexander and his family also that nothing relating to their tragic past be revived to cast a shadow upon their present harmonious domestic conditions or their name.  Hence she decided that she would let everything rest as it was, trusting that the future, governed by a higher than human wisdom, would unfold that which was best for them all.  She was exceedingly thankful that Dorothy had been away during John's entire illness.  She had returned only a few days before he left the Grenoble, and had gone directly to her new home, where Helen and the senior Alexanders received the happy couple, and where they had since been busy getting settled.  Helen had also arranged to spend the day that he moved with them, to make sure that Dorrie did not drop in unexpectedly upon her, to make startling discoveries, and also to avoid disturbing leave-takings with John.  When the young bride at length came to her, the little studio was dismantled, and it was explained that the rooms had been given up, as her mother's living apartment was now ample for all her work.  * * * * * * *  Five years have passed.  Madam Helen Ford still occupies her handsome suite in the Grenoble apartments, and pursues her chosen profession, still holding a warm place in the hearts of her many friends and patrons, and winning---literally and figuratively--golden laurels for herself, both as an artiste and a noble woman.  Dorothy is supremely happy in her beautiful home, and in the devotion of her adoring husband.  She is more lovely than ever, for she has developed something of her mother's sweet, womanly dignity; and, with her amiable disposition, her charm of manner, and reserve force of character, is becoming a recognized power in the circle where she moves.  Mr. Alexander has ever been a very attentive and considerate son-in-law.  He had always admired Helen exceedingly, from the evening of their introduction, but after learning the history of her earlier years--her sorrows, struggles, and conquests--he had regarded her as a wonder.  Her unfailing courage, the depth, strength, and beauty of her character; her wisdom as a mother, and her steadfast devotion to her profession, all impressed him beyond measure, and he began to idealize her.  That a woman whose life had been so blighted, who had been deserted and left penniless, with a child to rear and educate, could have risen to meet and conquer every adverse circumstance, assuming the burdens and duties of both father and mother, yet preserving through all the charm and sweetness of true womanliness, making the most of her talents, and winning for herself and her daughter both affluence and an enviable social position, seemed a marvel that caused him to bow in homage before her shrine.  And Helen fully appreciated Dorothy's manly husband, and grew to love him as well as if he had been an own son.  He had repeatedly pleaded with Helen to come and make her home with her ""children,"" but she had invariably replied: ""My 'children' do not need me, and I cannot become an idler yet.""  And, indeed, her many patrons would have regarded their loss as almost irreparable, had she ceased to grace their functions; for her voice had lost none of its brilliancy or sweetness, nor was her personality one whit less charming than of yore.  She had, however, of late consented to give up some of her younger pupils, and this had given her more freedom--more time to spend and go about with her dear ones, for she was still young at heart, and loved to mingle with young people in their social pleasures.  During these years she had never seen John.  He had rigidly kept his word, thus far, that he would ""never trouble her again.""  Through Mrs. Everleigh she had learned, shortly after he had opened his studio downtown, that he was doing well, having plenty of work, and getting fair prices; and this success, she was inclined to think, was, in a measure, at least, owing to the influence of that good lady herself.  A few months after he left the Grenoble she had received a letter from him, but he wrote very briefly, to explain that the check he inclosed was intended to cover the expense of his illness while at the Grenoble, including a generous thank-offering to Mrs. Harding for her devotion to him at that time.  Doctor Wing had later been remunerated for his services, and had felt himself more than repaid upon receiving a beautiful autumnal scene, done in oils, for which the artist refused to accept anything but the physician's receipted bill, he claiming that even then he was the debtor.  Mrs. Everleigh also was the recipient of what she termed a ""little gem,"" and Helen, while studying it during one of her visits to her friend, felt that it far exceeded anything she had ever yet seen from his brush.  Then he suddenly disappeared from New York without telling any one of his intention or future plans.  Long afterward, Helen read some complimentary notices, copied from both London and Paris papers, referring to the work of a rapidly rising American artist by the name of Hungerford; and this gave her great encouragement for the time, but for the last two years she had seen nothing relating either to his work or his whereabouts; and now and then the fear that perhaps he had again lapsed into old habits that had resulted in total failure would haunt and oppress her.  One afternoon in December, having an engagement to dine out, Helen made an elaborate toilet, and had just put the finishing touches to it, when her bell rang, and a registered package was delivered at her door. Upon opening it, greatly to her astonishment, a bank book and a check book fell into her lap, together with a letter, the superscription of which she instantly saw was in John's handwriting.  With trembling hands and quickened pulses, she unfolded the missive, and read:   HELEN: The inclosed books will, to some extent, explain themselves, but I will add that I have deposited in the National Bank of Commerce of New York, subject to your order, the sum of twelve thousand dollars. If five thousand dollars were allowed to remain at interest for fifteen years at five per cent, the result would be somewhere in the neighborhood of the amount named above.  I am not going to rehearse the past; I simply wish to say that I have put this money aside for Dorothy, if you think it best to give it to her and explain how it has come to her.  If, on the other hand, you feel it will disturb the harmony of her life to recall a great wrong of the past, let it remain to your own account, and use it as your heart dictates--it was really your money, you know, although set apart for Dorothy.  I offer it in all humility, as a tardy act of reparation, which conscience demands of me.  I have prospered beyond my expectations.  For a year after leaving New York I studied and worked under my old master, Monsieur Jacques, who has been more than kind to me.  Since then I have had more orders than I could fill, and nay name and work have been winning honorable mention in various art centers.  I am now in New York, on an important commission, but expect to return to Paris within a few weeks.  May I come to see you, Helen, and ascertain if Dorothy, for whom my starved heart is yearning beyond expression, will accept my offering, and grant me an interview?  Address me at the Hotel Astor.  JOHN.   Helen was deeply agitated while reading this letter.  She fully appreciated the writer's position in wishing to make amends for the wrong he had done so long ago, and she wanted to deal justly by him in all things.  But she did not quite know what to do about telling Dorothy, for the passing over of this little fortune, that had so unexpectedly fallen to her, would involve the rehearsal of many painful details, that might, perhaps, mar her present happiness.  Dorothy had never known of her father's return, five years ago; for, having been away on her wedding trip during most of his stay at the Grenoble, Helen had no difficulty in concealing the fact of his presence in the house from her.  Mr. Alexander was in prosperous circumstances; some time he would fall heir to great wealth, and Dorothy would never need this legacy.  Still, it was a peace offering--an effort to atone, which she felt, in justice to John, should not be ignored or rejected.  Had she any right to deprive Dorothy of the privilege of accepting or rejecting it, as she might see fit, or longer keep from her the fact of her father's reappearance, his reformation, and the renown he had recently achieved for himself?  Did she, herself, wish to see him again?  Would it be just or kind to deny him audience, withhold congratulations upon his success, and a Godspeed upon his future career?  These were difficult questions, and for the time plunged her in deepest perplexity.  But she tried to reverse the situation, to put herself in his position and to judge dispassionately what was the right thing to do.  John had evidently made good his avowed determination to retrieve his past; the tone of his letter was both dignified and sincere; the spirit of humility and fervent desire to make restitution, pervading the letter throughout, deeply impressed her, and caused her to feel that he was at last worthy to claim his daughter, provided Dorothy wished to be reunited to her father.  ""Dorothy is a practical, sensible little woman,"" she sighed at last. ""She is capable of deciding this matter, and certainly has the right to speak for herself.  Yes, I must tell her.""  She glanced at the clock.  It was after four, and Dorothy would be there presently.  She was coming to spend an hour or two with her, then Mr. Alexander was to take them to the Waldorf to dinner, and afterward to hear Melba in ""Il Trovatore.""  She resolved to improve the present opportunity, discuss the matter fully with her, and so free herself from further responsibility, as far as her child was concerned.  She had barely arrived at this conclusion, when her bell rang again.  ""That must be Mrs. Alexander, Nora; I am expecting her,"" she observed to the maid who appeared to answer the summons.  So Nora, as had been her custom with Dorothy, touched the button controlling the lower door, and, leaving the upper one ajar, went back to her work.  Meanwhile Helen had stepped to the mirror over the mantel to refasten a brooch on her corsage, which had become unclasped; then, at the sound of approaching steps, she turned, with outstretched hands, to greet her dear one, a fond smile on her lips, a glad welcome in her eyes, only to find herself looking into the white, eager face of--John Hungerford!  All the light went suddenly out of her own face; her arms fell limply to her sides; the smile froze upon her lips, and she caught her breath sharply, shocked beyond measure by his sudden appearance.  ""John!"" she gasped, with white lips, a look almost of terror in her eyes.     CHAPTER XXI.  SOME INTERESTING REVELATIONS.  ""Yes; forgive me, but I simply could not wait to hear from you, Helen--I had to come; I could not endure the suspense, so followed close upon my letter, which,"" glancing at the package on the table--""I see you have received.  Besides--I--had something else to say to you,"" he added, drawing nearer to her.  ""Something--else,"" she breathed, as he paused, yet scarcely knowing what she said.  ""Yes; I have dared to hope--dared to come and plead that you will forgive me the awful past and allow me to take care of you in the future,"" he resumed, in tremulous tones.  ""Wait--oh, wait!"" he begged, as she put out a hand to check him, ""let me speak--let me empty myself. I cannot conceive how I ever could have been so heartless, so selfish, so--brutal toward the most faithful and self-sacrificing wife in the world!  Let me atone--let me try to blot it out during the coming years.  You shall never know a care nor sorrow from which I can shield you.  My financial future is assured, I know I am a better man, and I want to prove it to you.  This newborn love for work, for right living, and noble achieving has made me yearn to mount even higher upon the ladder of success, and you would be a continual inspiration in my career; while, having been lifted out of the depths myself, I long to save others as you saved me, and we could work together in this way, for our faith and aims are now the same.  Helen--oh, Helen! will you come back to me?  Can you--can you?""  He was as white as marble as he held out appealing, shaking hands to her, his burning eyes fastened in agonized yearning upon her lovely though colorless face.  But in spite of her exceeding pallor, Helen had never appeared more beautiful in her life.  She was the picture of health.  Her splendidly developed form was clad in a rich evening gown of silver-gray chiffon velvet, elaborately decorated with duchess lace and touches of rose pink here and there to give it life.  A costly comb of gold gleamed among the massive coils of her bright hair, which scarcely showed a thread of silver even yet; a curiously wrought chain, to which a diamond cross was attached, was clasped around her white throat, and handsome diamond-studded bands of gold--a recent gift from her devoted son-in-law--encircled her shapely arms.  With her beautiful, high-bred face, and these becoming and elegant accessories of costume, she was a most attractive woman.  While John was speaking, she had stood motionless regarding him with mingled astonishment and dismay.  He had never seemed so manly to her before.  He had become more erect; his form had expanded, and he bore himself with a masterful dignity and self-possession that bespoke a wonderful growth in character.  His face was earnest and purposeful; his clothing was fine and rich in texture and fitted him perfectly; his linen was immaculate.  What a contrast to the broken-down, shabby suppliant who had come to her door five years previous!  He now looked the cultured, distinguished gentleman, and she knew he was a ""better man""--clean within as well as without.  Why, then, did not her heart respond, her pulses quicken, to his impassioned appeal?  She could not tell; she was simply appalled, breathless, almost paralyzed by his words.  ""Oh,"" she faltered, when he ceased speaking, ""why did you come?""  A groan of agony escaped him at this involuntary betrayal of her attitude toward him.  His hands clenched convulsively, then dropped heavily to his sides; the veins swelled out full and hard upon his forehead.  ""Because I could not keep away.  Because, ever since that day when you bade me try to live, start out anew and make my mark in the world, I have had but one aim--one overmastering desire in life--to make myself worthy of your esteem; to win an irreproachable name and position in the world to offer you, and atone, if ever so little, for what I made you suffer during those dreadful years of our early life.  It was you who aroused the dormant spark of manhood within me; now let me share with you the fruits of that awakening.  Oh, Helen!  I honor, reverence--I love you as never before; let me prove it.""  The man's voice, which had grown hoarse and painfully intense during this appeal, suddenly broke and became almost inaudible as he ended his appeal.  Helen was also deeply moved.  A great trembling seized her; the room began to grow dark; she swayed dizzily where she stood, and then sank weakly upon a near-by chair, but involuntarily throwing out a repelling hand, as John sprang forward to her assistance.  He paused abruptly, at her gesture, as if he had received a mortal blow.  Was his presence so repulsive to her that she could not endure to have him come near her?  For the moment he was crushed, humiliated beyond the power of speech; then he slowly drew himself erect, his chest heaving with a long, shuddering breath as he strove to recover something of self-possession.  ""Helen!"" the name burst sharply from his hueless lips; ""that means that I have asked too much--that you cannot----""  ""No, John, I cannot,"" she gently interposed.  The kindness in her tone half reassured him.  He leaned eagerly forward to search her face, but knew instantly from the look in her sorrowful though unresponsive gray eyes that his hopes were vain.  ""Oh, I might have known you never could forgive----"" he began, when she interrupted him again.  ""I have forgiven.""  Her voice was tremulous but very sweet.  ""I hold no bitterness against you in my heart--the last vestige was blotted out five years ago, as I then assured you, and to-day I realize that you are as worthy of my esteem as any other man who has resolutely overcome the errors of his past and is steadfastly adhering to high ideals and noble purposes.  I can and do rejoice most heartily in the conquest you have won,"" she went on, speaking with more calmness--""in the fame and prosperity you have achieved, and which I am sure you will continue to win.  But--John, the ties which once united us were too hopelessly severed to make it possible for us ever to piece them together again. When I pledged myself to you thirty years ago it was a lifelong vow I took.  When the law annulled that union and--you formed other relations, it was the same to me as if death had claimed you--I gave you up, as absolutely and hopelessly as if you had literally been buried from my sight; it was an unconditional surrender--the bond that had united us was rent asunder, leaving a great gulf between us, and I knew that the void thus made could never be filled again.  Then I took up my life to live it alone, and--thus I shall live until the end.""  The man had stood before her while she spoke, with averted face and bowed head, which sank lower and lower as she proceeded, until it rested upon his breast, while his attitude was like one bereft of hope.  ""I cannot bear it, Helen--even though I know the sentence is just,"" he faltered, at length breaking the silence.  ""It was through your heavenly compassion five years ago I gained a new lease of life, and that life I solemnly vowed should be spent in the effort to master the weaknesses that had been my ruin, and bereft me of all that a true man holds most sacred--family, home, and reputation.  Clinging steadfastly to this resolve and your dauntless motto--'that there is hardly any situation in life so adverse that it cannot be overcome if one only goes to work in the right way'--I have conquered self in many ways.  I have won a competence and some measure of renown as an artist; and my one inspiration throughout has been the hope of a blessed reunion with my dear ones.  Failing in this, the future holds nothing but emptiness for me,"" he concluded dejectedly.  ""The future holds all good for you, John,"" Helen returned, and, as once before during his illness, her voice was full of strength and encouragement.  ""You have, as you say, learned how to overcome--how to govern your life by principle instead of by impulse, and so have found your true manhood.  And you will keep on in the same way, for, as we know, there is but one goal for us all--one ultimate attainment really worth living for--the full stature of the perfect man.""  ""But I wanted to atone to you--to take care of you--to bear burdens for you, as you once bore them for me; I want to make you happy, Helen----""  ""You have already done that,"" she said, smiling up at him through eyes that were full of tears.  ""To know what you have been doing--what you have been achieving during the last five years--to see you as you are to-night--redeemed--gives me greater joy than you can realize.""  He turned and walked away from her.  He was crushed--almost on the point of breaking down utterly before her, notwithstanding his manhood, in view of this bitter disappointment.  Yet he began to understand that the old ties, which he himself had so ruthlessly severed, could indeed never be pieced together again.  There was between them a great gulf, in whose fathomless depths there lay a royal heart rent in twain, and a priceless love slain by his own reckless folly.  How could he bear to live out his life bereft of all his fond hopes?  Presently, having in a measure regained his composure, he returned to her.  ""At least you will allow me to make some substantial provision for your future,"" he observed, with a pathetic air of humility.  ""That surely is my right after my culpable improvidence of those early years.  My income is ample, and constantly increasing.  I will settle an annuity upon you for----""  ""But I do not need it, John, although I thank you for the kind thought,"" Helen gently interposed, her heart aching for him, and feeling that she herself could not much longer endure the strain of the interview.  ""My own income is more than sufficient for my support, especially now that Dorothy is settled in life; and, besides, I could not be happy to give up my work.  Ah!"" breaking off suddenly, as her bell rang once more--""that must be Dorothy; I am expecting her.""  ""Dorothy!  And I am here!"" the man exclaimed, in dismay.  Then, a sharp ring of pain in his tones: ""Helen, am I never to see Dorothy?""  She hesitated an instant, thinking rapidly.  ""Yes, I think you should see her,"" she then said.  ""At least, I will tell her that you have returned, show her your letter, and she shall decide for herself.  But, wait! you cannot get out now without meeting her, and the shock would be too much for her to run upon you without any preparation; step into the library behind you for a few minutes.""  She waved him toward the room, and he slipped into it, partly closing the door, just as Dorothy blithely swept through the reception hall and clasped her mother in her arms.  ""Mamma, dear, how lovely you are!"" Dorothy exclaimed, in a sprightly tone, as she fondly kissed her.  ""Your gown is vastly becoming; but aren't you a trifle pale to-night? or is it that tone of gray?  Sit down, do, and when I get my things off I have something very important to tell you.""  She threw off her elegant evening cloak and stepped forth, radiant in a beautiful costume of pale-pink silk, chiffon, and lace, while the nodding plumes of the same color on her dainty hat lent a piquant charm to the happy, sparkling face beneath.  ""Now, I have great news for you,"" she resumed, sinking upon a low chair beside her mother, and beginning to pull off her long white gloves. ""Whom do you think Clifford met to-day at the Gotham Club?  Oh, I am sure you could never guess, and I--I don't quite know how to tell you without giving you a tremendous shock; but the--the stranger was--oh, mamma!""--with a little nervous catch in her breath--""my father!""  ""Dorothy!""  It seemed to Helen the most marvelous coincidence in the world that Dorothy should have thus been already prepared, in a measure, for what she was about to reveal to her!  ""Wait, dearie--just try to be calm until I tell you all about it,"" Dorothy continued tenderly, as she slipped a supporting arm around Helen's waist.  ""It was Mr. Carruthers who was entertaining, and it goes without saying that he never dreamed he was introducing the father-in-law to his son-in-law.  Clifford, evidently, was the only one of the company who comprehended the situation, for, of course, he recognized the name, and then I had shown him that photo, which I have always kept.  It seems that he--my father--has been abroad again for several years, devoting himself to his art, and has won great honors; has had pictures hung in Paris and London exhibitions that have been raved over, and it is said he has made a great deal of money.  Mr. Carruthers met him first in Paris, and says he stands high there with the best artists, and is a conscientious as well as a tireless worker----""  ""Dorrie--I----""  Helen was on the point of checking her, for Dorothy's voice was so earnest, so full of animation, she thought John could not fail to hear every word.  But Dorothy would not be checked.  ""Wait, mamma,"" she interposed; ""I know just how you feel, for all the strength went out of me, and I almost broke down when Clifford told me about it, and what a prepossessing gentleman he is to-day; he says that whatever he may have been in the past, he is sure he is fine now, through and through.  Dear,"" she went on tremulously, ""it nearly takes my breath away to know that he has come back--is actually here in New York; and if he has changed--has become all that they say he has, it shows that there was good in him--I wonder what kind angel found him and rekindled the vital spark.  It makes me sorry, too, that I was quite so bitter against him, and said such cruel things to him that last day--I could almost wish to see him again if--if it were not for--that woman----""  ""She is dead, Dorothy.""  ""Mamma! how do you know?""  ""I have known it for more than five years, dear,"" Helen gravely returned; and, thinking she might as well tell her story now, for she saw that Dorothy was inclined to be lenient toward her father, and there was no reason why they should not meet at once.  ""While you were away on your wedding trip,"" she resumed, ""he--your father--came here----""  ""Here!""  ""Yes; I have never mentioned it, for you have been so happy I could not bear to tell you anything unpleasant.  He saw me one evening on the boat, as I was coming home after putting your house in order, and followed me here.  He looked poorly--was really ill, and I sent him to Mrs. Harding for the night.  He was taken alarmingly worse before morning, when I had him brought here, and Mrs. Harding took care of him, in the studio, for several weeks----""  ""In the studio!"" repeated Dorothy, breathless from astonishment.  ""Did she know who he was?""  ""No, dear; he gave his name to her as Williams, and she has always believed he was some one whom I had once known in California, and wished to befriend in his trouble--at least, until his relatives could be notified.""  ""Then he was here after I returned?""  ""Yes, for a few days only; but, before that, as soon as he began to gain strength, he seemed to want to take up his work again.  He painted two lovely pictures here, then hired a couple of rooms downtown, where he worked until he made enough money to take him abroad again.""  ""Mamma! then _you_ were the good angel who rekindled the vital spark!"" cried Dorothy, who was now almost sobbing.  ""It has comforted me, dear, to think that I may have helped to inspire him to take up his art again,"" Helen returned, adding: ""But it was Mrs. Everleigh who was really his 'good angel.'""  ""Mrs. Everleigh!""  ""Yes, I brought her here to see your father, and you know what she is able to do for people who will listen to her; but I will tell you more about that later.""  ""Did she know _who_ he was?"" Dorothy inquired.  ""No, dear; no one has ever known anything except as I told you--that he was an old acquaintance whom I would not allow to be taken to a hospital.""  ""Have you never heard from him since he went away?""  ""Yes; several months after he opened his studio--I think it must have been just before he went abroad again--he wrote me a brief letter, and inclosed a liberal check to cover the expenses of his illness, he said,"" Helen explained.  ""Now and then,"" she continued, ""I have seen a newspaper notice commenting favorably upon certain pictures he had painted, and I have rejoiced in his success.  This afternoon I received a package from him----""  ""Oh!""  ""Here it is, with the letter accompanying it.  Read it, dear, and then it will rest with you to say what shall be done regarding the matter of business to which he refers.""  Helen laid the missive on Dorothy's lap as she concluded.  ""How wonderful!"" breathed the young wife, as she seized and unfolded it with eager hands.  Tears rained over her cheeks, as she read; but she dashed them impatiently away and devoured the pages to the end.  ""Oh, what a transformation!  And isn't it beautiful to read between the lines and realize all that it means?"" she cried, a note of exultation in her tremulous tones.  ""He loves me still! he wants to see me! And--we should accept this money,"" she went on thoughtfully; ""don't you think so?  It would be unfair, unkind, to refuse it, when conscience has prompted him to make this restitution; unless, mamma, dear, you shrink from receiving it and from meeting----""  ""Dorothy,"" Helen hurriedly interrupted, ""it shall be as you say; if your heart yearns for your father----""  ""It does--it really does; I feel that he is good and true and worthy.""  ""I am sure he is, dear,"" said Helen heartily; ""and if you can give him the welcome he craves, and so help to make his life brighter in the future, it will give me joy to have you reunited.""  ""That is simply angelic of you, mamma,"" Dorothy eagerly exclaimed. Then, leaning nearer, she looked deep into her mother's eyes.  ""And you, dearest?"" she questioned.  But her mother's lips were mute.  They held each other's gaze in silence for a minute; then Helen bent forward and softly kissed her daughter on the lips.  It was as if she had said: ""That book is sealed forever.""  Dorothy's beautiful face clouded with a look of keen pain.  ""Yes, I can understand,"" she murmured, scarcely above her breath, and with a regretful sigh.  ""But you will let him come, as he begs in his letter--you will see him just once, to--to congratulate and wish him well; will you not?""  ""Dearest, I have already seen him.""  ""Mamma! when?"" cried Dorothy, startled beyond measure.  ""Just before you came in--immediately after receiving the package.  He could not wait for a reply to his letter--I had barely finished reading it when he came.  He is here now--in the library--waiting to see you.""  Dorothy sprang to her feet as if electrified, as indeed she was.  ""Here!"" she exclaimed, her voice resonant with joy.  ""My father here!""     CHAPTER XXII.  A HAPPY REUNION.  What of the man sitting alone there in Helen's library during the interview between Dorothy and her mother as just related?  Obeying Helen's behest, he had slipped into the room just as Dorothy entered the reception hall, where he had dropped into a chair, and sat, with his elbows on his knees, his face buried in his hands, like one bereft of hope--dazed, almost benumbed by his crushing disappointment in view of Helen's obvious attitude toward him.  For five long years he had lived and labored for this hour; with one high aim and end--one coveted goal set before him.  His aim was to redeem his wasted life.  To do this meant, first of all, to make of himself a man worthy of the name--a man, the pattern of which he had caught an inspiring glimpse during Mrs. Everleigh's never-to-be-forgotten visits to him at the Grenoble five years ago. And second, to achieve fame and fortune by means of the great gift with which he had been endowed, but which he until now had never fully appreciated, or possessed the energy and stability to develop and perfect.  And the end, the goal upon which his heart had been fixed, was to win back the beautiful and wonderful woman who had once been his wife, and with her his lovely daughter.  Only he himself knew what battles he had been forced to wage, while trampling under his feet the John Hungerford of former years; with his indolence, ease-loving habits, with his aversion to everything like real work and the propensity to shirk every possible responsibility; or how, during his first year or two in Paris, he had struggled with poverty, living in one poor, ill-furnished room, denying himself the luxuries, sometimes almost the necessities, of life, in order that he might avail himself of the coveted instruction of his old teacher.  Upon his arrival in Paris he had at once sought Monsieur Jacques--who, however, received him somewhat coldly at first--frankly stated his position to him and begged that he would accept him as a student again--at least until he could get a start for himself.  When the kind-hearted Frenchman was convinced of his sincerity--when he saw how eager he was for real work, he was overjoyed, and all his former interest in, and enthusiasm for, his old favorite, who he felt assured possessed the soul of the great artist, was aroused, and from that hour he spared no pains to encourage and inspire him to the highest achievements.  John himself was indefatigable.  He gave the closest and most conscientious attention to his work; no criticism or suggestion from Monsieur Jacques was unheeded; the smallest details were most carefully observed, and his progress was almost phenomenal.  The soul of the great artist was at last thoroughly awakened and began to live and breathe and glow in every stroke of his brush.  At times his teacher was almost afraid that his zeal would exhaust itself, or his strength fail; and occasionally he would compel him to leave his easel and go with him to his country home for a day of rest and recreation.  John's evenings were mostly spent in reading and study--in strange contrast to the opera-loving, theater-going habitu of former years.  Many things that Helen had dropped, much that Mrs. Everleigh had said, during those weeks of his illness at the Grenoble had shown him that they were living in a higher and purer mental atmosphere than he had ever known, and he craved to learn more of the faith or motive power that made possible the invariable peace and serenity that illumined their faces and exhaled from their presence.  He knew that if he were ever to win Helen again he must first rise himself, mentally and morally, to her stature.  At the same time he was daily becoming aware that, even though this great boon were to be denied him--even though the broken threads of his life could never be pieced together again, he was yearning, and would ever continue to yearn, for this inspiring faith for its own sake.  He had never forgotten the sense of something new having been born into his consciousness with Mrs. Everleigh's first visit to him--something that had been steadily expanding and unfolding within him until he had come to recognize it as the insatiable desire for conquest and dominion; conquest over self--dominion over all things unworthy in his life.  When the merit of his work began to be recognized, when his pictures began to be sold as soon as they were hung, no one was more jubilant than Monsieur Jacques himself; indeed, he seemed proud as a father over a gifted son.  ""Ah, Monsieur Hungerford will be great--his work will live!"" he was wont to say when asked for an opinion by would-be purchasers; and such praise could not fail to add value to the artist's productions and bring him plenty of orders.  A strong and lasting affection grew up between the two men; they often visited each other's studio--for by the beginning of his third year John had been in a position to establish himself in a handsome suite of apartments, with the simple legend ""Hungerford"" hung in the great front window--where they spent many an hour in social converse, or in discussing the merits and possibilities of various schools of art.  When, during the last year before his return to America, the great teacher passed from his sight, it seemed to John that he had lost a dear father as well as a wise counselor.  Now, with name and fame established, with an enviable social position attained, together with an assured competence, he had come back to his own country, his heart beating high with the hope of a blessed reunion with his dear ones--a hope that had been suddenly dashed to earth during his recent interview with Helen; and despair filled his soul as he sat there alone in her library and awaited the next move on the checker board of his life.  Dorothy's clear, sweet voice, as it floated to him from the next room, thrilled him through and through; and, as he could not fail to overhear much, if not all, that was said, he gradually became more calm, and began to take himself to task for his own shortsightedness.  He reasoned that he had been very unwise in coming upon Helen so abruptly--walking in upon her without even announcing himself, like some unbidden and unwelcome specter of the past.  He had been greatly surprised at having been admitted so unceremoniously; no one had inquired at the tube who was seeking entrance, and no one had answered when he asked if Mrs. Ford were in. Instead, the lower door had been immediately unlatched for him, and he had found the upper one open when he reached the suite.  Even then he felt he should have rung her private bell and waited until some one came; but, in his excitement, he had mechanically pushed the door wider, when, seeing Helen standing at the mirror, looking more lovely than he had ever seen her, he forgot all else save that he was once more in her presence.  He began to realize how he had startled--shocked her beyond measure by this impatient, unwarrantable intrusion upon her.  He should have been more considerate--should have waited a day or two, until she had had an opportunity to thoroughly master the contents of his letter and become accustomed to the thought of his return; when she could calmly decide and write him whether she wished to see him or not.  Yes, he had made what seemed to him an irreparable blunder, and he was proportionately miserable.  Then, as he caught something of what Dorothy was saying, as he detected the ring of eagerness and even joy in her tones while she told of her husband's meeting him at Mr. Carruthers' lunch; when she had said that her heart really yearned to be reunited to him, for she now believed him to be good and true and worthy, and--bless her dear conscientious soul!--that she had been sorry, and condemned herself for the bitter things she had said to him, the last time he had seen her, when he deserved them all, and much more--he began to take courage again; and it seemed as if he could control himself no longer--as if he must go to her, take her in his arms, claim her as his own, and bless her for her heavenly charity.  But he must not blunder again; he must not ruin his only chance by again being too precipitate.  Perhaps, after all, Dorrie might be his salvation--the one link that would eventually unite him with the woman he adored.  He almost wept when Helen had said if Dorothy could receive him and help to make his life brighter in the future, it would give her joy to have them reunited; then held his breath to catch her answer to Dorrie's question: ""And you, dearest?""  When there came no reply, his heart sank again; especially when the young wife had said she could understand, but begged her mother to meet him just once to congratulate him on his success and wish him well.  But the minute following, when he caught those eager, joy-ringing words: ""Here! my father, here!"" he was thrilled to the depths of his soul--he could restrain himself no longer.  The next moment he was in her presence!  Dorothy stood breathless, motionless, for a brief interval, searching his face with earnest, yearning eyes; then involuntarily she drifted toward him with outstretched hands.  With a great sob of joy welling up from his heart, John Hungerford gathered them in his, and, drawing her close to him, laid them upon his breast, holding them there while he feasted his hungry gaze upon her loveliness.  ""Dorothy, my darling!  You do not repudiate me!"" he faltered.  ""No, indeed, papa!  I am glad--glad that you have come,"" she responded, with an emphasis that left no doubt of her sincerity.  How his heart leaped with joy as the old childish form of address fell upon his ear!  And there had been nothing forced about it, either; it had slipped out as spontaneously as in their happiest days long ago.  As a child, Dorothy had been very fond of her father and he of her; but as she grew old enough to perceive his moral weakness, her respect for him had begun to wane.  Then, later, his indifference to duty, his neglect of, and last his unfaithfulness to, his wife had hurt her cruelly, had mortified her girlish pride, and aroused hot resentment of her mother's wrongs.  Yet there had been times when she had longed with all her heart for his cheery presence and genial companionship, and when she had grieved sorely over those last bitter, disrespectful words she had flung so passionately at him.  ""You--are--glad!"" he repeated, with deep emotion.  ""Yes, to see you--to hear you speak; to know that you have found your true self and your own place in the world, and I am very proud, too, of that!""  She was beginning to recover her composure, although there were tears in her voice as well as in her eyes.  ""You do not look so very different,"" she continued, smiling up at him through them, and drawing a little away from him for a better view, ""and yet you do; you are stouter, you have grown a little gray--a little older, but your eyes are the same, yet they are clearer, more tranquil; your face is graver, but more peaceful, and you are more----""  ""I hope I am more of a _man_, dear,"" he broke in upon her passionately, then suddenly checked himself.  ""But I am not going to recall the past to mar this blessed reunion, and the future will prove whether I really am or not.  I am filled with joy to find you willing to recognize the tie of kinship between us; it tells me that you have forgiven me; it augurs some measure of happiness for me in the coming years.  You already know something of what I have been doing of late years,"" he continued, after a slight pause; ""your mother has told you--I could not help overhearing some of the conversation between you--but you shall learn more in detail later.  How strange that I should have met your husband to-day!  Of course, I did not once suspect his relationship; he had the advantage of me there, and no doubt was sifting me with those clear, searching eyes of his.  Your husband!  To think of you being married, Dorothy!  I cannot realize it!  I am sure Alexander is a fine fellow, though.""  ""Indeed he is!"" asserted the fair wife, flushing with pleasure at this tribute to her dear one.  ""I am more proud of him than I can tell you, and very, very happy.  Listen!  I think he has just come in.""  Her quick ears had caught the sound of a latchkey being inserted in the outer door.  The next moment she turned to see her husband standing upon the threshold, viewing, with evident astonishment, the interesting tableau before him.  ""Oh, Clifford, dear!"" said Dorothy, throwing out a pretty, jeweled hand to him, ""come and greet my father, although I know that you have already met him.  Isn't it wonderful that I should have found him so soon after what you told me this afternoon?""  Mr. Alexander came forward and smilingly possessed himself of his wife's hand, while at the same time he cordially greeted his new acquaintance.  He had been strongly attracted to the man during their previous meeting earlier in the day, and truly John Hungerford had lost nothing of the personal charm of his earlier years.  Indeed, he had gained much in a new and gentle dignity, and a certain purposeful poise that had come to him with his awakening to the higher demands of life, and the stern realities and experiences of the last five years.  Mr. Alexander had been somewhat fearful that his wife's peace might be disturbed by her father's unexpected return, and now, even though he sympathized with her in her evident happiness, he secretly wondered how this reunion could be perfected without arousing unpleasant comment and curiosity regarding the past history of the family.  He had searched Helen's face as he saluted her, but was unable to read her thoughts, although he observed that she was exceedingly pale.  Dorothy graciously invited the gentlemen to be seated, and for fifteen or twenty minutes they chatted pleasantly of the events of the day; John keeping Dorothy close beside him and clinging to her hands as if he felt her to be his only anchor of hope in this critical hour.  Now and then he ventured a look at Helen, who was sitting a little apart, apparently listening; but her face told him nothing.  Her exceeding loveliness, however, impressed him as never before, and not a detail of her exquisite costume escaped his critical, artistic eye.  At length, after glancing at his watch, he arose, observing that he had an appointment with a party who was about to place an important order with him, and he must not linger longer, even though he was sorely tempted to do so.  Mr. Alexander had been considering the propriety of inviting him to join his party at dinner and later for the opera.  While he thought Dorothy might be glad to have her father with them, he was not so sure about Helen--he knew that this meeting must have been a great strain upon her, and it was now quite a relief to him to have the matter settled by Mr. Hungerford's reference to his important appointment.  ""I have some pictures with me which I think will please you,"" John continued, including them all in his glance as he spoke.  ""I would be glad to have you come to my hotel to view them privately, at your leisure; and as soon as it will be convenient for you, for next week they are to be hung for the exhibition of the Excelsior Art Club.""  ""We shall be delighted, and I can hardly wait to see them,"" said Dorothy eagerly.  ""May we come to-morrow?""  ""Do, by all means; come and lunch with me.  Mr. Alexander, can you spare the time to join us?"" John inquired, turning to the gentleman.  ""Certainly; and it will give me great pleasure to do so,"" he cordially responded.  ""Then shall we say one o'clock for the lunch?--if that will be convenient for the ladies,"" and John Hungerford bent an anxious look upon Helen as he concluded.  Helen had remained quietly in the background during the foregoing interview, having merely nodded a smiling welcome to Mr. Alexander as he entered.  She had been glad of the little respite to recover from the excitement occasioned by John's unlooked-for coming, and also by his impassioned appeal to her just preceding Dorothy's entrance.  Her father's invitation to lunch with him brought Dorothy to herself with a sudden inward shock.  ""Mamma, have you any engagement for to-morrow?"" she inquired, turning with an appealing look to her.  ""Yes, dear; I go to Yonkers for Mrs. Forsyth's reception.""  ""Then let it be Wednesday, if that will suit you better,"" John quickly interposed.  ""Wednesday I am booked for a concert, and Thursday for a house party at Tuxedo.  But pray do not let my plans interfere with yours; and, John, I will see the pictures later,"" Helen concluded, in a friendly tone, as she arose, came forward, and joined the group.  But intuitively the man knew, with a sinking heart, that he would not see her again, except, perhaps, as they might meet casually at the art club or some social function.  There was a suggestion of finality in her calm, self-possessed bearing, and even in her friendly tone, as she pleaded her engagements and promised to view his pictures later, which told him that his most cherished mission in returning to America had failed.  An icy chill struck at his heart, blighting all his fond hopes, and marble could not be whiter than was his face as he mechanically made his adieus and passed from the room.  At the door he turned and stood a moment, looking back at her, an expression of mingled reverence and despair in his eyes.  Then, with a slight renunciatory wave of his shapely hand, he was gone.     CHAPTER XXIII.  A FINAL RENUNCIATION.  The following day Dorothy and her husband lunched with Mr. Hungerford, as had been arranged, and afterward viewed with delighted appreciation the paintings that were soon to be exhibited at the Excelsior Art Club. There were twelve in all, and they displayed remarkable artistic ability, both in coloring and workmanship, together with certain realistic suggestions that appealed at once to the admiration and sympathies of the beholder.  As one studied them carefully one could not fail to be impressed with the depths of thought and a certain something forcibly suggestive of high ideals portrayed in them; or to recognize both the dignity and purity of sentiment that had inspired the hand that had so skillfully wielded the brush.  It was as if the artist's chief aim had been to give all that was best in himself to kindle the noblest qualities of heart in those who might look upon his pictures as long as they should endure.  They were, in truth, beautiful poems in color, to feast the eye, elevate and refine the thought--""songs without words,"" to make glad and uplift all who were able to appreciate in any degree the divinity of art.  Dorothy realized much of this as she went, day after day, to study these treasures which her father had brought from his atelier in Paris, and her heart glowed with ever-increasing pride in these unquestionable evidences of his genius.  It also overflowed with devout gratitude as she read, beneath the surface, the story of a wonderful consecration; of the courage, fortitude, and perseverance which the man, in his lonely exile, must have exercised in order to have been able to rise out of the depths to which he had fallen to achieve such grand and noble results.  One day she went alone for a last look at these beautiful pictures before they were hung for the public to view.  Upon this occasion the father and daughter had a long heart-to-heart talk with each other, during which John confessed to Dorothy that he had allowed himself to cherish strong hopes of a reunion with her mother, if he could prove that he had become worthy of her.  He realized now, however, he said, that under no circumstances could he be worthy, for he had cut himself off from her, absolutely and finally, by that irreparable mistake of long ago, and he ought to have known that such hopes could never be realized.  Hence, as matters now stood, he thought it would be best that the world should never be enlightened regarding their relationship to each other as father and daughter.  ""It could not be done, dear,"" he said, with lips that trembled painfully, ""without involving explanations and a rehearsal of past history which would make your mother unpleasantly conspicuous in the circle where she has maintained an honored position for so many years; and I could not bear to have a breath of gossip touch her, to mar her peace in any way.""  ""That is very considerate of you, papa,"" replied Dorothy, who had been greatly exercised in view of the matter herself, after becoming convinced that the breach of fifteen years ago could never be bridged.  She had already talked it over with her husband, and they had both agreed that, for her mother's sake, it would be better that the relationship between herself and the talented artist remain a secret among themselves.  Still, it was not an easy task for her, as she sat beside him, looking into his yearning eyes and listening to his faltering tones, to assent to his self-sacrificing proposition to relinquish his claim upon her, also.  John's heart sank at her words.  He had not quite given up all hope until that moment; but Dorothy's noncommittal reply had seemed to confirm his worst fears, that there was absolutely no hope of a reunion with Helen.  ""Then, for her sake, we will agree to----"" he began, in a hopeless voice.  ""For your own sake, papa, as well as for hers,"" interposed Dorothy, laying a gentle hand upon his arm, and almost weeping as she read the misery in his face.  ""We must not ignore the fact that it would not leave you unscathed in the midst of your honors; and, I imagine, there might arise other complications for us all.""  He captured her hand and stroked it tenderly with both of his own.  ""The problem might so easily have been solved if--if I could have won her anew; then we could all have come together again naturally, and no one would have been any the wiser regarding the past,"" he said.  ""Oh, Dorrie! do you think I could, even now?  _Is_ there no hope?""  His voice was hoarse from an agony of yearning as he concluded.  She could not answer him for a moment.  At length she lifted her tear-laden eyes to him.  ""Papa,"" she breathed, almost inaudibly, ""I--know there is--a grave in mamma's heart.""  ""The grave of a royal love brutally slain!  The grave of a love for which there can be no resurrection!"" he groaned.  ""I know it, too--God help me!  Well,"" he went on, after a struggle to recover himself, ""she has given you back to me as a pledge of her divine forgiveness, and for this I am unutterably grateful.  So, dear, we will keep our secret from the world, and make the most of our love for each other.  I shall go back to Paris within a couple of weeks, take up my work again, and keep on striving to accomplish something that will make the name of John Hungerford worth remembering.  I shall, probably, never return to this country, Dorrie; but you will occasionally come to me, will you not? Say that you will grant me these oases in the desert of my future.""  He looked so crushed, yet seemed so patient under his bitter disappointment that Dorothy, with difficulty, refrained from sobbing outright; but, forcing herself to speak cheerfully, she replied:  ""I certainly shall.  Paris is only a week away, and Clifford and I will enjoy slipping over now and then to spend a little time with you; besides, he always goes to London on business twice a year and takes me with him, so we shall see each other oftener than 'occasionally,' and I will write you every week.""  Thus it was arranged; and John tried to make the most of his reunion with Dorothy--tried to be grateful that there would be some blossoms of comfort to cull along the way, during what must otherwise be a very desolate future.  Nevertheless, the crushing blow his hopes had received, the bitter cup of renunciation he was forced to drink, seemed, for the time, almost more than he could bear, and left their crucial impress upon him.  He was a frequent visitor in Dorothy's lovely home on the Hudson during the remainder of his stay in New York, and both she and her husband exerted themselves to make his sojourn as delightful as possible, and so give him something pleasant to remember when he should leave them to resume his work and his lonely life abroad.  All Dorothy's old affection for him was revived during this visit, while both her admiration and wonder increased more and more with every interview, in view of his mental and moral attainments, to say nothing of the rapid advancement he had made in his profession, and which seemed likely to place him, at no distant period, in the foremost rank of artists.  He certainly was a distinguished-looking man, and one could not converse with him half an hour without becoming aware that beneath the attractive exterior there were depth and strength of character that would lead him still higher as years passed over him.  His work won honors at the exhibition of the Excelsior Art Club.  His two finest pictures were marked sold on the opening day, and were sent to grace Dorothy's home at its close.  The others were all disposed of, and when the artist finally left for Paris he not only bore with him a rich harvest from his brush, but several orders for paintings to be executed at his convenience.  He had made his presence in the city known to Mrs. Everleigh as soon as he could conveniently arrange to do so; and upon meeting him she had also appeared deeply impressed by the great change in him.  It hardly seemed possible to her that he could be the same man who, five years previous, had expressed little hope of his life, and manifested no energy or wish to prolong it.  At her request John had called upon her at her home.  When he sent up his card bearing his own name instead of that of Williams, under which she had previously known him, she came to him wearing a look of perplexity; but she instantly recognized and greeted him cordially, although she studied his face earnestly as she shook hands with him.  ""My friend, there has certainly been a remarkable change in you,"" she said.  ""I am more than glad to see you, however, after all these years, and""--smiling into his eyes--""I am sure you have been forging straight ahead.""  ""You once told me, Mrs. Everleigh, that 'there was still work for me to do here,' and I have been _trying_ to do it,"" John returned, with an answering smile.  ""I feel confident you have; but""--referring to the card in her hand--""how is it that you have sent me this--that you now call yourself John Hungerford?""  John explained that at the time he first met her, when he was so low down in the world, he had dropped his last name, using his middle one instead, to avoid recognition.  ""You do not mean to tell me that you are John Hungerford, the artist, who has been exhibiting at the Excelsior Art Club?"" the lady inquired, with sudden alertness.  ""Yes--the same,"" he quietly replied.  ""Well, I congratulate you!"" she earnestly returned.  ""I have seen your pictures, but, of course, did not dream that I knew the artist.  You certainly have been working to some purpose.  But how was it that you ran away from us so unceremoniously five years ago?""  ""That must have seemed rather ungrateful of me, I am compelled to admit,"" said the gentleman, with a deprecatory smile.  ""But I had already been the recipient of too many favors; I felt I must begin to stand alone--I had to _prove myself_--so I suddenly cut my cables, and launched out into the deep.""  ""We all have to stand alone in the sifting process,"" returned his companion.  ""We all have to prove ourselves, and I believed that you would make good; but I would have been glad of some tidings from you now and then.""  ""Thank you; and it is very gratifying to know that you had that confidence in me,"" said John, with evident emotion.  ""I feel, however, that I owe much to you for the measure of success I have attained, for you taught me something of what life and its individual responsibilities mean.  But for your and H--Mrs. Ford's unparalleled kindness to me in my darkest hour, I shrink from the thought of what might have been the alternative.""  Mrs. Everleigh shot a quick glance at him as he made the slip on Helen's name; then she gently observed, with her old winning smile:  ""We must not forget the Power behind, my friend.""  ""No, dear lady, we must not; neither must we be unappreciative of His faithful messengers,"" John gravely returned.  Then he proceeded to briefly outline something of his life and work abroad, speaking in high praise of his teacher, Monsieur Jacques, and his kindly interest in him; and referred modestly to his own success, both in Paris and also during his present visit to America.  They spent a delightful hour together, and when he finally arose to go Mrs. Everleigh named an early date for him to come and dine _en famille_, ""for,"" she told him, ""I have not heard half enough even yet. I must see more of you while you are here.""  When he was gone she sat a long time in deep thought, evidently reviewing the very interesting story John had related to her.  At last she looked up with a slight start, a peculiar look sweeping over her face.  ""Hunger--_ford_!"" she said aloud, dwelling with emphasis on the last syllable of the name.  ""I wonder----""  What she wondered can only be surmised, but, knowing what she did of Helen's life--even though she had never been told the story in detail--it is safe to say that a suspicion of the relationship between John, Helen, and Dorothy had been aroused in her mind.  John did not see Helen again during the remainder of his stay in New York.  Helen felt that it would be better for them both to avoid another interview, and she persistently kept herself in the background. But she went to see his pictures, as she had promised, after they were hung at the art club, choosing her opportunity one day when Dorothy and her father were out of town, and thus securing for herself plenty of time in which to examine his work without fear of a personal encounter, which would have been both awkward and painful for her.  She afterward wrote him a frank, friendly letter, in which she expressed highest commendation of his beautiful pictures, and her assurance that the future would bring him even higher honors.  She closed by asking him to paint her a portrait of Dorothy the first time she went to Paris to visit him, which, she knew, would be in about three months.  This request was like balm and oil to the man's wounded spirit, for it assured him that she never would have made it if there had been aught but good will in her heart for him, and immediately upon his arrival in his adopted city--adopted, for he knew that it would henceforth be his permanent home--he at once proceeded to fulfill her wishes, doing what he could from memory and the aid of photographs, that he might not have so much to do when Dorothy should arrive to give him sittings for the finishing touches.  Six months from the time she had made her request, Helen received a beautiful, richly framed, three-quarter size portrait of her dear one, that was to make her heart glad during all her future years--glad not only because of the faithful likeness, graceful pose, and artistic costume, but because of the masterly work that proclaimed it a production of high art, and which, to her, seemed like a priceless seal set upon the complete redemption of the man who had once been her husband.     CHAPTER XXIV.  A MASTERPIECE.  Three years later, at the earnest solicitation of Dorothy and her husband, Helen temporarily gave up her work to make an extensive tour abroad with them.  It proved to be, on the whole, a most happy and restful experience; and yet there were times when a tear would start, or a regretful sigh escape her lips as they went over ground and visited many places which she had traversed with John during their ideal honeymoon, so many years ago, and which could not fail to revive old associations.  But her two devoted children were delightful traveling companions, well posted, observant, and thoroughly appreciative in their sight-seeing; always careful for her comfort, and allowing her to rest whenever she did not feel quite equal to their more vigorous desire to ""miss nothing that was worth while.""  During these years previous to their trip, Dorothy had visited her father, in Paris, several times, and when at home had corresponded regularly with him; thus Helen had been in the way of knowing something of the details of his life and work.  She had also read of various notable things he had done, from foreign papers and art journals.  But he had never directly communicated with her, nor she with him, except to thank him most gratefully for, and express her delighted appreciation of, Dorothy's portrait when it came to her carefully packed and ready to hang upon her wall.  She had realized that when they reached Paris, where they planned to remain longer than in most of the places they visited, she would be liable to see more or less of him, and she had taken this carefully into consideration before giving her consent to the trip.  She felt that if she went she must cast no shadow upon the pleasure of the others.  Dorothy had again become very fond and exceedingly proud of her father; Mr. Alexander also held him in highest esteem; hence, in justice to all, her own attitude must, in some measure, at least, conform to theirs.  She believed, too, that John understood her, and would not allow himself to do or say aught that would disturb her harmony, while she would be able to avoid awkward situations by always having one or both of the young people with her.  John received them, upon their arrival, with delightful hospitality, and they found that every possible arrangement had been made for their comfort in one of the best pensions of the city, as they preferred to be located thus, rather than in a less homelike hotel.  He had also a most attractive program planned for nearly every day of their stay, subject, of course, to their preferences.  But Helen found herself more weary than she had anticipated on reaching Paris, and decided it would be best for her to keep quiet for a few days before attempting to do very much sight-seeing.  As usual, she was allowed to follow the dictates of her own judgment, while the others fell in with John's plans, and went about with their accustomed vigor.  The third day after their arrival, one of Helen's former patrons, who was residing just out of the city, and had known of her coming, came to call upon her, and, seeing that she was not quite herself, begged the Alexanders to give her up into her hands for a week or two, promising to give her every care, and take her about to whatever points of interest she desired or felt able to visit.  Dorothy was wise enough to see that it was not altogether weariness, but something of a mental strain, under which her mother was laboring, and she unhesitatingly, even eagerly, consented to the arrangement.  So Helen was whisked away to Mrs. Hollis Hamilton's delightful villa, where, with an unacknowledged burden lifted from her heart, she began immediately to rally, and was quite herself again in a few days.  She saw John only twice after that, until the day before they were to leave Paris.  They had planned several times to visit his studio, but something unforeseen had interfered each day.  Now they could put it off no longer, and that afternoon found them all gathered in his rooms to view his treasures and have a little last visit together before their departure on the evening express for Italy.  It was the studio of an artist who had won both wealth and renown; richly furnished, artistically decorated, and hung with rare gems from his own brush, as well as from that of others; besides being graced with various costly curios, with some fine pieces of sculpture, upon which one could feast the eye for hours at a time, and never become weary of the privilege.  John had a few minutes' chat alone with Helen after they had made a leisurely circuit of the rooms together, and during which he explained, among other things--what interested her most--the underlying thought that had inspired the subject and been wrought into many of his pictures.  It was the last time he ever saw her, and the memory of her face as she listened to and talked with him never left him.  As long as he lived, it shed its luster on his pathway.  It was like a radiant star, newly risen, which would henceforth illumine the gloom of his darkened firmament and cheer his lonely hours.  She had been charming, had seemed to forget everything but her interest in what he had been doing since his visit to America.  She showed herself well versed in art, also--that she had kept up with the times, and was even well posted upon some of his own more important works that had received honorable mention in some of the art journals.  She was eloquent, winsome, and witty by turns.  Her manner was frank and gracious, without a vestige of self-consciousness to suggest that she even remembered the tragedy of their earlier years; something as her attitude might have been toward a brother or a friend in whom she was deeply interested.  And when at length they paused in a great bow window that overlooked a beautiful view beyond the sunlit Seine, she observed, with glowing eyes:  ""What a glorious thing it is to be a 'great artist!'  Yes,"" she added, as he made a gesture of dissent, ""Monsieur Jacques' prophecy is proving true; I can see it unfolding more and more.  It is a rare and noble gift to conceive exquisite mental pictures like these, and then be able to portray them for others to enjoy.  Who can estimate their refining influence upon the world, especially when one can _feel_ the uplifting thought and inspiring lessons underlying their surface beauty?  If you are putting as faithful work into your life problem, John, as you are expending upon your art, you surely are making rapid strides toward that 'goal' of which we talked three years ago.""  ""I believe I am honestly trying to do so, Helen,"" was his quietly earnest reply; ""but""--his lips whitening suddenly--""the way, at times, has seemed toilsome and--lonely.""  His voice almost broke on the last word.  Helen's clear eyes drooped; her face clouded for an instant, and, with an inward shock of misery, John knew that his words had recalled the lonely way she had once trodden, bearing both her own burdens and his. He could have scourged himself for his thoughtlessness.  He had charged himself that morning not to recall by look or word one sorrowful thought to mar her visit to him.  But the next moment she looked up, serene and smiling.  ""That is an experience we all have at times, I fancy,"" she said.  ""It is a suggestion of that little demon--self-pity--that is liable to make a great deal of mischief for us if we do not speedily conquer him.""  ""I have found that out for myself,"" he observed, with an answering smile; ""he is at hand to trip at every step, if one is not alert.""  ""And we know, John, there can be no company warfare, the battle is individual, one must toil and fight alone for self-conquest.  It does seem wearisome at times, but it is grand, too, for every individual victory won is just so much more achieved toward the redemption of all, because it lessens the evil in the world in exact proportion to our achievements, and also becomes an incentive to others to buckle on their armor and do likewise.""  ""That is a beautiful, helpful thought.  I shall not forget it,"" he gravely returned.  ""And I shall not forget my visit here,"" Helen went on brightly, ""nor this lovely view out over the Seine; these beautiful rooms, so artistically arranged--they make an ideal studio--and particularly your work.  It has made me very glad to know what you are doing and how you are doing it.""  ""Thank you for telling me that,"" was all that John could trust himself to say.  ""By the way,"" she continued, after a moment, during which her eyes had roved over the place with a lingering look, as if to impress it indelibly upon her mind, ""what have you behind those draperies?  I thought it a window as I passed them; now I see it is not.""  John glanced in the direction she indicated, then back at her, hesitated, and for a moment seemed at a loss to know how to answer her. At length he said:  ""That is a picture upon which I have been working, at intervals, for seven or eight years.  Many times I have thought it finished, but I am not yet through touching it up--not quite satisfied with it.""  ""It must be something intensely absorbing,"" said Helen.  ""What is the subject, if you will not deem it an impertinent question?""  ""I have called it 'My Inspiration,' because it and what it portrays have long been that to me.""  ""How interesting!  You make me very curious.  May I see it, John?""  Again he hesitated, flushing slightly, and Helen, thinking perhaps she had been presuming, was on the point of begging his pardon for her thoughtlessness, when he smiled faintly, and replied:  ""Yes; while I am showing Dorothy and Alexander a little gem in marble in the other room, go and look at it--no one as yet, save myself, has ever seen it.""  He turned to the younger couple, who were approaching, and, saying he had something to show them, led them into the adjoining room; while Helen, experiencing something very like a sense of guilt for having begged such a favor--a favor that as yet had never been granted another, not even Dorothy, it appeared--stole to the curtained alcove, loosened the knotted cords, parted the heavy draperies, and looked up. A low exclamation of astonishment escaped her.  The picture was a full-length portrait of herself, wearing an evening dress of silver-gray velvet, garnished with costly lace and touches of rose pink, and standing just as she had stood that night, three years ago, when John took leave of her in her apartment at the Grenoble.  The figure and costume were perfect in every detail.  John had a remarkable memory, and he had caught not only the unconscious grace of her pose, but also the sheen of the velvet, and almost the exact pattern of the lace she had worn.  And the face!  It almost made her weep as she studied it, for she could not fail to read the tender, worshipful stroke of his brush in its every line and feature.  She could not bear it; the story it told was too pathetic.  She let the draperies fall gently back into place, reknotted the cords as she had found them, and stole softly from the room into the reception hall, where she waited, trying to recover her color and self-control, until the others rejoined her.  Evidently they had been having a playful tilt over something, for Dorothy was bubbling over with merriment, and both gentlemen were smiling in sympathy with her mood.  Thus Helen escaped any sense of awkwardness in meeting John again, or in the leave-takings that followed; no reference was made to the picture; he did not even seem to be curious as to how it had affected her, and she parted from him with what appeared to be but a cordial handshake and a simple good-by.  But when they were gone, the man stood, white and motionless, for several moments where they left him, struggling mightily within himself.  The supreme test had come--the test of absolute and final renunciation.  At last, with a quick indrawn breath that was very like a sob, he went to the alcove where Helen had stood but a few minutes before, loosened and drew back the draperies, and studied his picture long and critically.  Then he brought his pallet and brushes, and worked with great care upon it for nearly an hour.  At last he stood back and searched the face again.  He had changed the eyes in some way that made it seem almost as if a living soul were looking through them, and the lips wore a softer, tenderer expression that was like a gentle benediction.  The new light in the eyes, and the sweeter lines about the mouth were the result of what he had caught from Helen herself an hour ago while they stood talking together in the great window overlooking the Seine.  ""It is finished; and it is my masterpiece!"" he breathed, as he reverently drew the curtains over the picture again, and then went thoughtfully back to his workroom.  * * * * * * *  During many years that followed, the work of John Hungerford continued to win fame and fortune for the faithful artist.  A ""Hungerford painting"" was regarded as a prize by its possessor, and its price as of secondary importance; while, as a man, his name became the recognized synonym of all that was benevolent, good, and philanthropic.  Struggling artists of merit were generously and tactfully helped over hard places, and sent on their way rejoicing; the idler was kindly reproved and inspired to more persistent effort; the prodigal and profligate were sought after, and, with convincing argument and wise counsel, won from their degrading and enervating pleasures to higher appreciation of the talent with which they had been endowed; the faint-hearted were encouraged, the sick befriended, the homeless sheltered.  In fine, the distinguished artist was not only recognized as an authority and a connoisseur in his profession, but also as a great-hearted _Man_, whose beautiful and hospitable home, as well as his studio, became a delightful and instructive resort for lovers of art, or a refuge in time of need, as the case might be, and open to all who, with worthy intent and honest endeavor, chose to avail themselves of his generosity and kindness.  Thus John Hungerford not only labored assiduously to charm the eye, elevate and refine the taste, and mold the character through the medium of his art, but he also--having himself been disciplined and purified by suffering, and redeemed by faithfully working out his own salvation; having learned also the higher meaning of Life, and its sacred individual responsibilities--became the beloved benefactor of many who, in later years, followed in his footsteps, to enrich, in turn, the lives of others.  Thus he abundantly fulfilled Helen's inspiring prophecy: ""The future holds all good for you, John,"" and so found peace, if not absolute happiness, at eventide.

INDUCTION

SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.

Enter Hostess and Sly

SLY.
I’ll pheeze you, in faith.

HOSTESS.
A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY.
Y’are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues; look in the chronicles: we
came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, _paucas pallabris_; let the
world slide. Sessa!

HOSTESS.
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?

SLY.
No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed and warm
thee.

HOSTESS.
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.

[_Exit_]

SLY.
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law. I’ll not
budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.

[_Lies down on the ground, and falls asleep._]


Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsmen and Servants.

LORD.
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss’d,
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth’d brach.
Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

FIRST HUNTSMAN.
Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss,
And twice today pick’d out the dullest scent;
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

LORD.
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well, and look unto them all;
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.

FIRST HUNTSMAN.
I will, my lord.

LORD.
[_Sees Sly_.] What’s here? One dead, or drunk?
See, doth he breathe?

SECOND HUNTSMAN.
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm’d with ale,
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.

LORD.
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you, if he were convey’d to bed,
Wrapp’d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forget himself?

FIRST HUNTSMAN.
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

SECOND HUNTSMAN.
It would seem strange unto him when he wak’d.

LORD.
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up, and manage well the jest.
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
And with a low submissive reverence
Say ‘What is it your honour will command?’
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew’d with flowers;
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say ‘Will’t please your lordship cool your hands?’
Someone be ready with a costly suit,
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease.
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And, when he says he is—say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

FIRST HUNTSMAN.
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
As he shall think by our true diligence,
He is no less than what we say he is.

LORD.
Take him up gently, and to bed with him,
And each one to his office when he wakes.

[Sly _is borne out. A trumpet sounds._]

Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.

[_Exit_ Servant.]

Belike some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.


Re-enter Servant.

How now! who is it?

SERVANT.
An it please your honour, players
That offer service to your lordship.

LORD.
Bid them come near.


Enter Players.

Now, fellows, you are welcome.

PLAYERS.
We thank your honour.

LORD.
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?

PLAYER.
So please your lordship to accept our duty.

LORD.
With all my heart. This fellow I remember
Since once he play’d a farmer’s eldest son;
’Twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well.
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform’d.

PLAYER.
I think ’twas Soto that your honour means.

LORD.
’Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in happy time,
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play tonight;
But I am doubtful of your modesties,
Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,—
For yet his honour never heard a play,—
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile, he grows impatient.

PLAYER.
Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antick in the world.

LORD.
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them friendly welcome everyone:
Let them want nothing that my house affords.

[_Exit one with the Players._]

Sirrah, go you to Barthol’mew my page,
And see him dress’d in all suits like a lady;
That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,
And call him ‘madam,’ do him obeisance.
Tell him from me—as he will win my love,—
He bear himself with honourable action,
Such as he hath observ’d in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished;
Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say ‘What is’t your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?’
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy’d
To see her noble lord restor’d to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
And if the boy have not a woman’s gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which, in a napkin being close convey’d,
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch’d with all the haste thou canst;
Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.

[_Exit Servant._]

I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman;
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband;
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I’ll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen,
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

[_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord’s house.

Sly is discovered in a rich nightgown, with Attendants: some with
apparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a
servant.

SLY.
For God’s sake! a pot of small ale.

FIRST SERVANT.
Will’t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

SECOND SERVANT.
Will’t please your honour taste of these conserves?

THIRD SERVANT.
What raiment will your honour wear today?

SLY.
I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I ne’er drank
sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef. Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets
than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet:
nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look
through the over-leather.

LORD.
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!

SLY.
What! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of
Burton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by
transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask
Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she
say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for
the lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here’s—

THIRD SERVANT.
O! this it is that makes your lady mourn.

SECOND SERVANT.
O! this is it that makes your servants droop.

LORD.
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck:
Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,

[_Music._]

And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep? We’ll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm’d up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp’d,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

FIRST SERVANT.
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.

SECOND SERVANT.
Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

LORD.
We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid
And how she was beguiled and surpris’d,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

THIRD SERVANT.
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

LORD.
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.

FIRST SERVANT.
And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o’er-run her lovely face,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none.

SLY.
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? Or have I dream’d till now?
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed;
And not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
And once again, a pot o’ the smallest ale.

SECOND SERVANT.
Will’t please your mightiness to wash your hands?

[_Servants present a ewer, basin and napkin._]

O, how we joy to see your wit restor’d!
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
These fifteen years you have been in a dream,
Or, when you wak’d, so wak’d as if you slept.

SLY.
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?

FIRST SERVANT.
O! yes, my lord, but very idle words;
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,
And rail upon the hostess of the house,
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal’d quarts.
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY.
Ay, the woman’s maid of the house.

THIRD SERVANT.
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Nor no such men as you have reckon’d up,
As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
And twenty more such names and men as these,
Which never were, nor no man ever saw.

SLY.
Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL.
Amen.


Enter the Page, as a lady, with Attendants.

SLY.
I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.

PAGE.
How fares my noble lord?

SLY.
Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.
Where is my wife?

PAGE.
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?

SLY.
Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?
My men should call me lord: I am your goodman.

PAGE.
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY.
I know it well. What must I call her?

LORD.
Madam.

SLY.
Alice madam, or Joan madam?

LORD.
Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.

SLY.
Madam wife, they say that I have dream’d
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

PAGE.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon’d from your bed.

SLY.
’Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.

PAGE.
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two;
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians have expressly charg’d,
In peril to incur your former malady,
That I should yet absent me from your bed:
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

SLY.
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath
to fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in despite of the
flesh and the blood.


Enter a Messenger.

MESSENGER.
Your honour’s players, hearing your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal’d your blood,
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play,
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY.
Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold
or a tumbling-trick?

PAGE.
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.

SLY.
What! household stuff?

PAGE.
It is a kind of history.

SLY.
Well, we’ll see’t. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world
slip: we shall ne’er be younger.




ACT I

SCENE I. Padua. A public place.


Flourish. Enter Lucentio and Tranio.

LUCENTIO.
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arriv’d for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy,
And by my father’s love and leave am arm’d
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant well approv’d in all,
Here let us breathe, and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.
Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,
It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv’d,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achiev’d.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO.
_Mi perdonato_, gentle master mine;
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur’d.
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you:
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en;
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

LUCENTIO.
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay awhile; what company is this?

TRANIO.
Master, some show to welcome us to town.

[_Lucentio and Tranio stand aside._]


Enter Baptista, Katherina, Bianca, Gremio and Hortensio.

BAPTISTA.
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolv’d you know;
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder.
If either of you both love Katherina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

GREMIO.
To cart her rather: she’s too rough for me.
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?

KATHERINA.
[_To Baptista_] I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO.
Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

KATHERINA.
I’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool,
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.

HORTENSIO.
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GREMIO.
And me, too, good Lord!

TRANIO.
Husht, master! Here’s some good pastime toward:
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO.
But in the other’s silence do I see
Maid’s mild behaviour and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO.
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA.
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said,—Bianca, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.

KATHERINA.
A pretty peat! it is best put finger in the eye, and she knew why.

BIANCA.
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to look, and practise by myself.

LUCENTIO.
Hark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO.
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca’s grief.

GREMIO.
Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPTISTA.
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv’d.
Go in, Bianca.

[_Exit Bianca._]

And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up;
And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.

[_Exit._]

KATHERINA.
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What! shall I be appointed
hours, as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave?
Ha!

[_Exit._]

GREMIO.
You may go to the devil’s dam: your gifts are so good here’s none will
hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our
nails together, and fast it fairly out; our cake’s dough on both sides.
Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any
means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her father.

HORTENSIO.
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our
quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us
both,—that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be
happy rivals in Bianca’s love,—to labour and effect one thing
specially.

GREMIO.
What’s that, I pray?

HORTENSIO.
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

GREMIO.
A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO.
I say, a husband.

GREMIO.
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very
rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO.
Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud
alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could
light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO.
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to
be whipp’d at the high cross every morning.

HORTENSIO.
Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come;
since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth
friendly maintained, till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a
husband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to’t
afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets
the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO.
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin
his wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and
rid the house of her. Come on.

[_Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio._]

TRANIO.
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO.
O Tranio! till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness;
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

TRANIO.
Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch’d you, nought remains but so:
_Redime te captum quam queas minimo._

LUCENTIO.
Gramercies, lad; go forward; this contents;
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.

TRANIO.
Master, you look’d so longly on the maid.
Perhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all.

LUCENTIO.
O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
When with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand.

TRANIO.
Saw you no more? mark’d you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO.
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
And with her breath she did perfume the air;
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO.
Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd,
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew’d her up,
Because she will not be annoy’d with suitors.

LUCENTIO.
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!
But art thou not advis’d he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?

TRANIO.
Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now ’tis plotted.

LUCENTIO.
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO.
Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO.
Tell me thine first.

TRANIO.
You will be schoolmaster,
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That’s your device.

LUCENTIO.
It is: may it be done?

TRANIO.
Not possible; for who shall bear your part
And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son;
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;
Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?

LUCENTIO.
_Basta_, content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we be distinguish’d by our faces
For man or master: then it follows thus:
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
I will some other be; some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
’Tis hatch’d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour’d hat and cloak.
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

[_They exchange habits_]

TRANIO.
So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
For so your father charg’d me at our parting,
‘Be serviceable to my son,’ quoth he,
Although I think ’twas in another sense:
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO.
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye.


Enter Biondello.

Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO.
Where have I been? Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stol’n your clothes?
Or you stol’n his? or both? Pray, what’s the news?

LUCENTIO.
Sirrah, come hither: ’tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my count’nance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill’d a man, and fear I was descried.
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life.
You understand me?

BIONDELLO.
I, sir! Ne’er a whit.

LUCENTIO.
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed to Lucentio.

BIONDELLO.
The better for him: would I were so too!

TRANIO.
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master’s, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master, Lucentio.

LUCENTIO.
Tranio, let’s go.
One thing more rests, that thyself execute,
To make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,
Sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.

[_Exeunt._]

[_The Presenters above speak._]

FIRST SERVANT.
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.

SLY.
Yes, by Saint Anne, I do. A good matter, surely: comes there any more
of it?

PAGE.
My lord, ’tis but begun.

SLY.
’Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: would ’twere done!

[_They sit and mark._]

SCENE II. Padua. Before Hortensio’s house.

Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.

PETRUCHIO.
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua; but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.

GRUMIO.
Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your
worship?

PETRUCHIO.
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO.
Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you
here, sir?

PETRUCHIO.
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate;
And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.

GRUMIO.
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO.
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, and you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it;
I’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

[_He wrings Grumio by the ears._]

GRUMIO.
Help, masters, help! my master is mad.

PETRUCHIO.
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!


Enter Hortensio.

HORTENSIO.
How now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend
Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO.
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
_Con tutto il cuore ben trovato_, may I say.

HORTENSIO.
_Alla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signor mio Petruchio._
Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.

GRUMIO.
Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a
lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me
knock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a
pip out? Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first, then had not
Grumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO.
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
And could not get him for my heart to do it.

GRUMIO.
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: ‘Sirrah
knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly’? And
come you now with ‘knocking at the gate’?

PETRUCHIO.
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO.
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio’s pledge;
Why, this’s a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO.
Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceas’d,
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

HORTENSIO.
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife?
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel;
And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,
And very rich: but th’art too much my friend,
And I’ll not wish thee to her.

PETRUCHIO.
Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates’ Xanthippe or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection’s edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO.
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him
gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot
with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as
two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO.
Petruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,
I will continue that I broach’d in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Her only fault,—and that is faults enough,—
Is, that she is intolerable curst,
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO.
Hortensio, peace! thou know’st not gold’s effect:
Tell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

HORTENSIO.
Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman;
Her name is Katherina Minola,
Renown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO.
I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you,
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO.
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O’ my word, and she
knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good
upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so; why,
that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll
tell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a
figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no
more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.

HORTENSIO.
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
And her withholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
Supposing it a thing impossible,
For those defects I have before rehears’d,
That ever Katherina will be woo’d:
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO.
Katherine the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO.
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguis’d in sober robes,
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may, by this device at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO.
Here’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks
lay their heads together!


Enter Gremio and Lucentio disguised, with books under his arm.

Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO.
Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.

GRUMIO.
A proper stripling, and an amorous!

GREMIO.
O! very well; I have perus’d the note.
Hark you, sir; I’ll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand,
And see you read no other lectures to her.
You understand me. Over and beside
Signior Baptista’s liberality,
I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,
And let me have them very well perfum’d;
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

LUCENTIO.
Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you,
As for my patron, stand you so assur’d,
As firmly as yourself were still in place;
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

GREMIO.
O! this learning, what a thing it is.

GRUMIO.
O! this woodcock, what an ass it is.

PETRUCHIO.
Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO.
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!

GREMIO.
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promis’d to enquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man; for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

HORTENSIO.
’Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promis’d me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress:
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so belov’d of me.

GREMIO.
Belov’d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO.
[_Aside._] And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO.
Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO.
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO.
I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

GREMIO.
No, say’st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCHIO.
Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son.
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see.

GREMIO.
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to’t a God’s name;
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO.
Will I live?

GRUMIO.
Will he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her.

PETRUCHIO.
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?
And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO.
[_Aside_] For he fears none.

GREMIO.
Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arriv’d,
My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.

HORTENSIO.
I promis’d we would be contributors,
And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe’er.

GREMIO.
And so we will, provided that he win her.

GRUMIO.
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.


Enter Tranio brave, and Biondello.

TRANIO.
Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO.
He that has the two fair daughters; is’t he you mean?

TRANIO.
Even he, Biondello!

GREMIO.
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to—

TRANIO.
Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?

PETRUCHIO.
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

TRANIO.
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let’s away.

LUCENTIO.
[_Aside_]  Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO.
Sir, a word ere you go.
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO.
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO.
No; if without more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO.
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?

GREMIO.
But so is not she.

TRANIO.
For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIO.
For this reason, if you’ll know,
That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO.
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO.
Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have, and me for one.
Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

GREMIO.
What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO.
Sir, give him head; I know he’ll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO.
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

HORTENSIO.
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?

TRANIO.
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO.
Sir, sir, the first’s for me; let her go by.

GREMIO.
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve.

PETRUCHIO.
Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed;
The younger then is free, and not before.

TRANIO.
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO.
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO.
Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health;
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO, BIONDELLO.
O excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone.

HORTENSIO.
The motion’s good indeed, and be it so:—
Petruchio, I shall be your _ben venuto_.

[_Exeunt._]




ACT II

SCENE I. Padua. A room in Baptista’s house.


Enter Katherina and Bianca.

BIANCA.
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I’ll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHERINA.
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
Whom thou lov’st best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA.
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

KATHERINA.
Minion, thou liest. Is’t not Hortensio?

BIANCA.
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I’ll plead for you myself but you shall have him.

KATHERINA.
O! then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

BIANCA.
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHERINA.
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.

[_Strikes her._]


Enter Baptista.

BAPTISTA.
Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

KATHERINA.
Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be reveng’d.

[_Flies after Bianca._]

BAPTISTA.
What! in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

[_Exit Bianca._]

KATHERINA.
What! will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

[_Exit._]

BAPTISTA.
 Was ever gentleman thus griev’d as I?
But who comes here?


Enter Gremio, with Lucentio in the habit of a mean man; Petruchio, with
Hortensio as a musician; and Tranio, with Biondello bearing a lute and
books.

GREMIO.
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA.
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. God save you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO.
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call’d Katherina, fair and virtuous?

BAPTISTA.
I have a daughter, sir, call’d Katherina.

GREMIO.
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO.
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man of mine,

[_Presenting Hortensio._]

Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

BAPTISTA.
Y’are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO.
I see you do not mean to part with her;
Or else you like not of my company.

BAPTISTA.
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO.
Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son;
A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA.
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

GREMIO.
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.
Backare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO.
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREMIO.
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing. Neighbour, this is
a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness,
myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely
give unto you this young scholar,

[_Presenting Lucentio._]

that has been long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and
other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is
Cambio; pray accept his service.

BAPTISTA.
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio. [_To Tranio._]
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to
know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO.
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo,
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA.
Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?

TRANIO.
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

BAPTISTA.
A mighty man of Pisa: by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir.
[_To Hortensio_.] Take you the lute,
[_To Lucentio_.] and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!


Enter a Servant.

Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters, and tell them both
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.

[_Exeunt Servant with Hortensio, Lucentio and Biondello._]

We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

PETRUCHIO.
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have bettered rather than decreas’d:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

BAPTISTA.
After my death, the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO.
And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA.
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain’d,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together,
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;
So I to her, and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA.
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm’d for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO.
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
That shake not though they blow perpetually.


Re-enter Hortensio, with his head broke.

BAPTISTA.
How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?

HORTENSIO.
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA.
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

HORTENSIO.
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier:
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA.
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO.
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow’d her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
‘Frets, call you these?’ quoth she ‘I’ll fume with them’;
And with that word she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fiddler,
And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO.
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench!
I love her ten times more than e’er I did:
O! how I long to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA.
[_To Hortensio_.] Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
She’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO.
I pray you do.

[_Exeunt Baptista, Gremio, Tranio and Hortensio._]

I will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why, then I’ll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash’d with dew:
Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
Then I’ll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.


Enter Katherina.

Good morrow, Kate; for that’s your name, I hear.

KATHERINA.
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Katherine that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO.
You lie, in faith, for you are call’d plain Kate,
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness prais’d in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,—
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,—
Myself am mov’d to woo thee for my wife.

KATHERINA.
Mov’d! in good time: let him that mov’d you hither
Remove you hence. I knew you at the first,
You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, what’s a moveable?

KATHERINA.
A joint-stool.

PETRUCHIO.
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHERINA.
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO.
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHERINA.
No such jade as bear you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO.
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light,—

KATHERINA.
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO.
Should be! should buz!

KATHERINA.
Well ta’en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO.
O, slow-wing’d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

KATHERINA.
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO.
Come, come, you wasp; i’ faith, you are too angry.

KATHERINA.
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO.
My remedy is then to pluck it out.

KATHERINA.
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

PETRUCHIO.
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
In his tail.

KATHERINA.
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO.
Whose tongue?

KATHERINA.
Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.

PETRUCHIO.
What! with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHERINA.
That I’ll try.

[_Striking him._]

PETRUCHIO.
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.

KATHERINA.
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO.
A herald, Kate? O! put me in thy books.

KATHERINA.
What is your crest? a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO.
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KATHERINA.
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO.
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

KATHERINA.
It is my fashion when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.

KATHERINA.
There is, there is.

PETRUCHIO.
Then show it me.

KATHERINA.
Had I a glass I would.

PETRUCHIO.
What, you mean my face?

KATHERINA.
Well aim’d of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO.
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

KATHERINA.
Yet you are wither’d.

PETRUCHIO.
’Tis with cares.

KATHERINA.
I care not.

PETRUCHIO.
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth, you ’scape not so.

KATHERINA.
I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.

PETRUCHIO.
No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
’Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers.
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers;
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
O! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

KATHERINA.
Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.

PETRUCHIO.
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O! be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,
And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!

KATHERINA.
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO.
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

KATHERINA.
A witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCHIO.
Am I not wise?

KATHERINA.
Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO.
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed;
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife your dowry ’greed on;
And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,—
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,—
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.


Re-enter Baptista, Gremio and Tranio.


Here comes your father. Never make denial;
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.

BAPTISTA.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO.
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA.
Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?

KATHERINA.
Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
You have show’d a tender fatherly regard
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO.
Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world
That talk’d of her have talk’d amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity;
And to conclude, we have ’greed so well together
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHERINA.
I’ll see thee hang’d on Sunday first.

GREMIO.
Hark, Petruchio; she says she’ll see thee hang’d first.

TRANIO.
Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!

PETRUCHIO.
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
If she and I be pleas’d, what’s that to you?
’Tis bargain’d ’twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O! you are novices: ’tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.

BAPTISTA.
I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
God send you joy, Petruchio! ’Tis a match.

GREMIO, TRANIO.
Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO.
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
We will have rings and things, and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate; we will be married o’ Sunday.

[_Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina, severally._]

GREMIO.
Was ever match clapp’d up so suddenly?

BAPTISTA.
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO.
’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTA.
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMIO.
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for;
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.

TRANIO.
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.

GREMIO.
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

TRANIO.
Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.

GREMIO.
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back; ’tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO.
But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA.
Content you, gentlemen; I’ll compound this strife:
’Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca’s love.
Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?

GREMIO.
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold:
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff’d my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss’d with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework;
Pewter and brass, and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die tomorrow this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO.
That ‘only’ came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father’s heir and only son;
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I’ll leave her houses three or four as good
Within rich Pisa’s walls as anyone
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch’d you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO.
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall have, besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles’ road.
What, have I chok’d you with an argosy?

TRANIO.
Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,
And twice as much, whate’er thou offer’st next.

GREMIO.
Nay, I have offer’d all; I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have;
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

TRANIO.
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA.
I must confess your offer is the best;
And let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me;
If you should die before him, where’s her dower?

TRANIO.
That’s but a cavil; he is old, I young.

GREMIO.
And may not young men die as well as old?

BAPTISTA.
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolv’d. On Sunday next, you know,
My daughter Katherine is to be married;
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
If not, to Signior Gremio.
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO.
Adieu, good neighbour.

[_Exit Baptista._]

Now, I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table. Tut! a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

[_Exit._]

TRANIO.
A vengeance on your crafty wither’d hide!
Yet I have fac’d it with a card of ten.
’Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but suppos’d Lucentio
Must get a father, call’d suppos’d Vincentio;
And that’s a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

[_Exit._]




ACT III

SCENE I. Padua. A room in Baptista’s house.


Enter Lucentio, Hortensio and Bianca.

LUCENTIO.
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katherine welcome’d you withal?

HORTENSIO.
But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO.
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain’d!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO.
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA.
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
I’ll not be tied to hours nor ’pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down;
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tun’d.

HORTENSIO.
You’ll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

[_Retires._]

LUCENTIO.
That will be never: tune your instrument.

BIANCA.
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO.
Here, madam:—
_Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis._

BIANCA.
Construe them.

LUCENTIO.
_Hic ibat_, as I told you before, _Simois_, I am Lucentio, _hic est_,
son unto Vincentio of Pisa, _Sigeia tellus_, disguised thus to get your
love, _Hic steterat_, and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing, _Priami_,
is my man Tranio, _regia_, bearing my port, _celsa senis_, that we
might beguile the old pantaloon.

HORTENSIO. [_Returning._]
Madam, my instrument’s in tune.

BIANCA.
Let’s hear.—

[Hortensio _plays._]

O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO.
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA.
Now let me see if I can construe it: _Hic ibat Simois_, I know you not;
_hic est Sigeia tellus_, I trust you not; _Hic steterat Priami_, take
heed he hear us not; _regia_, presume not; _celsa senis_, despair not.

HORTENSIO.
Madam, ’tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO.
All but the base.

HORTENSIO.
The base is right; ’tis the base knave that jars.
[_Aside_] How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I’ll watch you better yet.

BIANCA.
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO.
Mistrust it not; for sure, Æacides
Was Ajax, call’d so from his grandfather.

BIANCA.
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt;
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

HORTENSIO.
[_To Lucentio_] You may go walk and give me leave a while;
My lessons make no music in three parts.

LUCENTIO.
Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
[_Aside_] And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv’d,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO.
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA.
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO.
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

BIANCA.
   _Gamut_ I am, the ground of all accord,
     _A re_, to plead Hortensio’s passion;
   _B mi_, Bianca, take him for thy lord,
     _C fa ut_, that loves with all affection:
   _D sol re_, one clef, two notes have I
   _E la mi_, show pity or I die.
Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not:
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
To change true rules for odd inventions.


Enter a Servant.

SERVANT.
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books,
And help to dress your sister’s chamber up:
You know tomorrow is the wedding-day.

BIANCA.
Farewell, sweet masters, both: I must be gone.

[_Exeunt Bianca and Servant._]

LUCENTIO.
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

[_Exit._]

HORTENSIO.
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wand’ring eyes on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

[_Exit._]

SCENE II. The same. Before Baptista’s house.

Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, Katherina, Bianca, Lucentio and
Attendants.

BAPTISTA.  [_To Tranio_.]
Signior Lucentio, this is the ’pointed day
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said? What mockery will it be
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?

KATHERINA.
No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc’d
To give my hand, oppos’d against my heart,
Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen;
Who woo’d in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
And to be noted for a merry man,
He’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage,
Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo’d.
Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
And say ‘Lo! there is mad Petruchio’s wife,
If it would please him come and marry her.’

TRANIO.
Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.

KATHERINA.
Would Katherine had never seen him though!

[_Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others._]

BAPTISTA.
Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
For such an injury would vex a very saint;
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.


Enter Biondello.

Master, master! News! old news, and such news as you never heard of!

BAPTISTA.
Is it new and old too? How may that be?

BIONDELLO.
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?

BAPTISTA.
Is he come?

BIONDELLO.
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA.
What then?

BIONDELLO.
He is coming.

BAPTISTA.
When will he be here?

BIONDELLO.
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO.
But say, what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO.
Why, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old
breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases,
one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta’en out of the town
armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points: his
horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine;
troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of
windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the
fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed
in the back and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a
half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep’s leather, which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now
repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman’s crupper
of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in
studs, and here and there pieced with pack-thread.

BAPTISTA.
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO.
O, sir! his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with
a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered
with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humour of forty fancies
prick’d in’t for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and
not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.

TRANIO.
’Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell’d.

BAPTISTA.
I am glad he’s come, howsoe’er he comes.

BIONDELLO.
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA.
Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO.
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA.
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO.
No, sir; I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA.
Why, that’s all one.

BIONDELLO.
     Nay, by Saint Jamy,
     I hold you a penny,
     A horse and a man
     Is more than one,
     And yet not many.


Enter Petruchio and Grumio.

PETRUCHIO.
Come, where be these gallants? Who is at home?

BAPTISTA.
You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO.
And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA.
And yet you halt not.

TRANIO.
Not so well apparell’d as I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO.
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA.
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie! doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival.

TRANIO.
And tell us what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain’d you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO.
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which at more leisure I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;
The morning wears, ’tis time we were at church.

TRANIO.
See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO.
Not I, believe me: thus I’ll visit her.

BAPTISTA.
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO.
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha’ done with words;
To me she’s married, not unto my clothes.
Could I repair what she will wear in me
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

[_Exeunt Petruchio, Grumio and Biondello._]

TRANIO.
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTISTA.
I’ll after him and see the event of this.

[_Exeunt Baptista, Gremio and Attendants._]

TRANIO.
But, sir, to love concerneth us to add
Her father’s liking; which to bring to pass,
As I before imparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,—whate’er he be
It skills not much; we’ll fit him to our turn,—
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
And make assurance here in Padua,
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

LUCENTIO.
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly,
’Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform’d, let all the world say no,
I’ll keep mine own despite of all the world.

TRANIO.
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business.
We’ll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.


Re-enter Gremio.

Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

GREMIO.
As willingly as e’er I came from school.

TRANIO.
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO.
A bridegroom, say you? ’Tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.

TRANIO.
Curster than she? Why, ’tis impossible.

GREMIO.
Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO.
Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.

GREMIO.
Tut! she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him.
I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
’Ay, by gogs-wouns’ quoth he, and swore so loud
That, all amaz’d, the priest let fall the book;
And as he stoop’d again to take it up,
The mad-brain’d bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book, and book and priest:
‘Now take them up,’ quoth he ‘if any list.’

TRANIO.
What said the wench, when he rose again?

GREMIO.
Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp’d and swore
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: ‘A health!’ quoth he, as if
He had been abroad, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff’d off the muscadel,
And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face,
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem’d to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck,
And kiss’d her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo.
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before.
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

[_Music plays._]


Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Bianca, Baptista, Hortensio, Grumio and
Train.

PETRUCHIO.
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me today,
And have prepar’d great store of wedding cheer
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

BAPTISTA.
Is’t possible you will away tonight?

PETRUCHIO.
I must away today before night come.
Make it no wonder: if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO.
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO.
It may not be.

GREMIO.
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO.
It cannot be.

KATHERINA.
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO.
I am content.

KATHERINA.
Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO.
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHERINA.
Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO.
Grumio, my horse!

GRUMIO.
Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHERINA.
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go today;
No, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself.
’Tis like you’ll prove a jolly surly groom
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO.
O Kate! content thee: prithee be not angry.

KATHERINA.
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO.
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KATHERINA.
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO.
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own.
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I’ll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
I’ll buckler thee against a million.

[_Exeunt Petruchio, Katherina and Grumio._]

BAPTISTA.
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO.
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

TRANIO.
Of all mad matches, never was the like.

LUCENTIO.
Mistress, what’s your opinion of your sister?

BIANCA.
That, being mad herself, she’s madly mated.

GREMIO.
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA.
Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom’s place;
And let Bianca take her sister’s room.

TRANIO.
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

BAPTISTA.
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let’s go.

[_Exeunt._]




ACT IV

SCENE I. A hall in Petruchio’s country house.


Enter Grumio.

GRUMIO.
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was
ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray’d? Was ever man so weary? I am
sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them.
Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to
my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere
I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall
warm myself; for, considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis!


Enter Curtis.

CURTIS.
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO.
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to
my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good
Curtis.

CURTIS.
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO.
O, ay! Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no water.

CURTIS.
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?

GRUMIO.
She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou knowest winter tames
man, woman, and beast; for it hath tamed my old master, and my new
mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS.
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO.
Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot; and so long am I at the
least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our
mistress, whose hand,—she being now at hand,— thou shalt soon feel, to
thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS.
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO.
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and therefore fire. Do
thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost
frozen to death.

CURTIS.
There’s fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO.
Why, ‘Jack boy! ho, boy!’ and as much news as wilt thou.

CURTIS.
Come, you are so full of cony-catching.

GRUMIO.
Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s the cook?
Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the
servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every
officer his wedding-garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills
fair without, and carpets laid, and everything in order?

CURTIS.
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO.
First, know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fallen out.

CURTIS.
How?

GRUMIO.
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.

CURTIS.
Let’s ha’t, good Grumio.

GRUMIO.
Lend thine ear.

CURTIS.
Here.

GRUMIO.
[_Striking him._] There.

CURTIS.
This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO.
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale; and this cuff was but to
knock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin: _Imprimis_, we
came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,—

CURTIS.
Both of one horse?

GRUMIO.
What’s that to thee?

CURTIS.
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO.
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have
heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have
heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled; how he left her with
the horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse stumbled; how she
waded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she
prayed, that never prayed before; how I cried; how the horses ran away;
how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of
worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS.
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO.
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes
home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas,
Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest; let their heads be sleekly
combed, their blue coats brush’d and their garters of an indifferent
knit; let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a
hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all
ready?

CURTIS.
They are.

GRUMIO.
Call them forth.

CURTIS.
Do you hear? ho! You must meet my master to countenance my mistress.

GRUMIO.
Why, she hath a face of her own.

CURTIS.
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO.
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.

CURTIS.
I call them forth to credit her.

GRUMIO.
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.


Enter four or five Servants.

NATHANIEL.
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP.
How now, Grumio!

JOSEPH.
What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS.
Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL.
How now, old lad!

GRUMIO.
Welcome, you; how now, you; what, you; fellow, you; and thus much for
greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATHANIEL.
All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRUMIO.
E’en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not,—
Cock’s passion, silence! I hear my master.


Enter Petruchio and Katherina.

PETRUCHIO.
Where be these knaves? What! no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?—

ALL SERVANTS.
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO.
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish’d grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

GRUMIO.
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.

PETRUCHIO.
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?

GRUMIO.
Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpink’d i’ the heel;
There was no link to colour Peter’s hat,
And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing;
There was none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

PETRUCHIO.
Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.

[_Exeunt some of the Servants._]

Where is the life that late I led?
   Where are those—?  Sit down, Kate, and welcome.
Food, food, food, food!


Re-enter Servants with supper.

Why, when, I say?—Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.—
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains! when?
   It was the friar of orders grey,
   As he forth walked on his way:
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:

[_Strikes him._]

Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where’s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:

[_Exit Servant._]

One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.—

[_Servant lets the ewer fall. Petruchio strikes him._]

You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KATHERINA.
Patience, I pray you; ’twas a fault unwilling.

PETRUCHIO.
A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear’d knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?—
What’s this? Mutton?

FIRST SERVANT.
Ay.

PETRUCHIO.
Who brought it?

PETER.
I.

PETRUCHIO.
’Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me that love it not?

[_Throws the meat, etc., at them._]

There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all.
You heedless joltheads and unmanner’d slaves!
What! do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight.

KATHERINA.
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
The meat was well, if you were so contented.

PETRUCHIO.
I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away,
And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better ’twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; tomorrow ’t shall be mended.
And for this night we’ll fast for company:
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

[_Exeunt Petruchio, Katherina and Curtis._]

NATHANIEL.
Peter, didst ever see the like?

PETER.
He kills her in her own humour.


Re-enter Curtis.

GRUMIO.
Where is he?

CURTIS.
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

[_Exeunt._]


Re-enter Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO.
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And ’tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg’d,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come, and know her keeper’s call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat today, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I’ll find about the making of the bed;
And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl,
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.

[_Exit._]

SCENE II. Padua. Before Baptista’s house.

Enter Tranio and Hortensio.

TRANIO.
Is ’t possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO.
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

[_They stand aside._]


Enter Bianca and Lucentio.

LUCENTIO.
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

BIANCA.
What, master, read you? First resolve me that.

LUCENTIO.
I read that I profess, _The Art to Love_.

BIANCA.
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO.
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.

[_They retire._]

HORTENSIO.
Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear that your Mistress Bianca
Lov’d none in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO.
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO.
Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
Nor a musician as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise
For such a one as leaves a gentleman
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call’d Hortensio.

TRANIO.
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO.
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter’d her withal.

TRANIO.
And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!

HORTENSIO.
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy widow
Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov’d me
As I have lov’d this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

[_Exit Hortensio. Lucentio and Bianca advance._]

TRANIO.
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As ’longeth to a lover’s blessed case!
Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

BIANCA.
Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?

TRANIO.
Mistress, we have.

LUCENTIO.
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO.
I’ faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be woo’d and wedded in a day.

BIANCA.
God give him joy!

TRANIO.
Ay, and he’ll tame her.

BIANCA.
He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO.
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA.
The taming-school! What, is there such a place?

TRANIO.
Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.


Enter Biondello, running.

BIONDELLO.
O master, master! I have watch’d so long
That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO.
What is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO.
Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
I know not what; but formal in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO.
And what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO.
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio.
Take in your love, and then let me alone.

[_Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca._]


Enter a Pedant.

PEDANT.
God save you, sir!

TRANIO.
And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

PEDANT.
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO.
What countryman, I pray?

PEDANT.
Of Mantua.

TRANIO.
Of Mantua, sir?  Marry, God forbid,
And come to Padua, careless of your life!

PEDANT.
My life, sir! How, I pray? for that goes hard.

TRANIO.
’Tis death for anyone in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay’d at Venice; and the Duke,—
For private quarrel ’twixt your Duke and him,—
Hath publish’d and proclaim’d it openly.
’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come
You might have heard it else proclaim’d about.

PEDANT.
Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence, and must here deliver them.

TRANIO.
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

PEDANT.
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

TRANIO.
Among them know you one Vincentio?

PEDANT.
I know him not, but I have heard of him,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO.
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO.
[_Aside._]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.

TRANIO.
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodg’d;
Look that you take upon you as you should!
You understand me, sir; so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city.
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

PEDANT.
O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO.
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand:
My father is here look’d for every day
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
’Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here:
In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you.
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

[_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. A room in Petruchio’s house.

Enter Katherina and Grumio.

GRUMIO.
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

KATHERINA.
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars that come unto my father’s door
Upon entreaty have a present alms;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starv’d for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed.
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat
’Twere deadly sickness, or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

GRUMIO.
What say you to a neat’s foot?

KATHERINA.
’Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.

GRUMIO.
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil’d?

KATHERINA.
I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO.
I cannot tell; I fear ’tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHERINA.
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO.
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

KATHERINA.
Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO.
Nay, then I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHERINA.
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.

GRUMIO.
Why then the mustard without the beef.

KATHERINA.
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,

[_Beats him._]

That feed’st me with the very name of meat.
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.


Enter Petruchio with a dish of meat; and Hortensio.

PETRUCHIO.
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO.
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHERINA.
Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO.
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here, love; thou seest how diligent I am,
To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee:

[_Sets the dish on a table._]

I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What! not a word? Nay, then thou lov’st it not,
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.

KATHERINA.
I pray you, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO.
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

KATHERINA.
I thank you, sir.

HORTENSIO.
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, Mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.

PETRUCHIO.
[_Aside._]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
Will we return unto thy father’s house
And revel it as bravely as the best,
With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things;
With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knavery.
What! hast thou din’d? The tailor stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.


Enter Tailor.

Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
Lay forth the gown.—


Enter Haberdasher.

What news with you, sir?

HABERDASHER.
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! ’tis lewd and filthy:
Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.

KATHERINA.
I’ll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

PETRUCHIO.
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.

HORTENSIO.
[_Aside_] That will not be in haste.

KATHERINA.
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
Your betters have endur’d me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, thou say’st true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.

KATHERINA.
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.

[_Exit Haberdasher._]

PETRUCHIO.
Thy gown? Why, ay: come, tailor, let us see’t.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What’s this? A sleeve? ’Tis like a demi-cannon.
What, up and down, carv’d like an apple tart?
Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber’s shop.
Why, what i’ devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?

HORTENSIO.
[_Aside_] I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown.

TAILOR.
You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCHIO.
Marry, and did; but if you be remember’d,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
I’ll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

KATHERINA.
I never saw a better fashion’d gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

TAILOR.
She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO.
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
Thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Brav’d in mine own house with a skein of thread!
Away! thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr’d her gown.

TAILOR.
Your worship is deceiv’d: the gown is made
Just as my master had direction.
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

GRUMIO.
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.

TAILOR.
But how did you desire it should be made?

GRUMIO.
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

TAILOR.
But did you not request to have it cut?

GRUMIO.
Thou hast faced many things.

TAILOR.
I have.

GRUMIO.
Face not me. Thou hast braved many men; brave not me: I will neither be
fac’d nor brav’d. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown;
but I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.

TAILOR.
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.

PETRUCHIO.
Read it.

GRUMIO.
The note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.

TAILOR.
’Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown.’

GRUMIO.
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it
and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread; I said, a gown.

PETRUCHIO.
Proceed.

TAILOR.
‘With a small compassed cape.’

GRUMIO.
I confess the cape.

TAILOR.
‘With a trunk sleeve.’

GRUMIO.
I confess two sleeves.

TAILOR.
‘The sleeves curiously cut.’

PETRUCHIO.
Ay, there’s the villainy.

GRUMIO.
Error i’ the bill, sir; error i’ the bill. I commanded the sleeves
should be cut out, and sew’d up again; and that I’ll prove upon thee,
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.

TAILOR.
This is true that I say; and I had thee in place where thou shouldst
know it.

GRUMIO.
I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and
spare not me.

HORTENSIO.
God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO.
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO.
You are i’ the right, sir; ’tis for my mistress.

PETRUCHIO.
Go, take it up unto thy master’s use.

GRUMIO.
Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress’ gown for thy master’s
use!

PETRUCHIO.
Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?

GRUMIO.
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
Take up my mistress’ gown to his master’s use!
O fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO.
[_Aside_]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
[_To Tailor._] Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.

HORTENSIO.
[_Aside to Tailor._] Tailor, I’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow;
Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
Away, I say! commend me to thy master.

[_Exit Tailor._]

PETRUCHIO.
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father’s
Even in these honest mean habiliments.
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor
For ’tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What, is the jay more precious than the lark
Because his feathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.
If thou account’st it shame, lay it on me;
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father’s house.
Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
Let’s see; I think ’tis now some seven o’clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.

KATHERINA.
I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two,
And ’twill be supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO.
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let ’t alone:
I will not go today; and ere I do,
It shall be what o’clock I say it is.

HORTENSIO.
Why, so this gallant will command the sun.

[_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. Padua. Before Baptista’s house.

Enter Tranio and the Pedant dressed like Vincentio

TRANIO.
Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?

PEDANT.
Ay, what else? and, but I be deceived,
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO.
’Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as ’longeth to a father.

PEDANT.
I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
’Twere good he were school’d.


Enter Biondello.

TRANIO.
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO.
Tut! fear not me.

TRANIO.
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

BIONDELLO.
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look’d for him this day in Padua.

TRANIO.
Th’art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.


Enter Baptista and Lucentio.

Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
[_To the Pedant_] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;
I pray you stand good father to me now;
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

PEDANT.
Soft, son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:
And,—for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him,—to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father’s care,
To have him match’d; and, if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow’d;
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

BAPTISTA.
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANIO.
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied, and such assurance ta’en
As shall with either part’s agreement stand?

BAPTISTA.
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO.
Then at my lodging, and it like you:
There doth my father lie; and there this night
We’ll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA.
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened:
Lucentio’s father is arriv’d in Padua,
And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.

LUCENTIO.
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!

TRANIO.
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

BAPTISTA.
I follow you.

[_Exeunt Tranio, Pedant and Baptista._]

BIONDELLO.
Cambio!

LUCENTIO.
What say’st thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO.
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

LUCENTIO.
Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO.
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or
moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO.
I pray thee moralize them.

BIONDELLO.
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a
deceitful son.

LUCENTIO.
And what of him?

BIONDELLO.
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

LUCENTIO.
And then?

BIONDELLO.
The old priest at Saint Luke’s church is at your command at all hours.

LUCENTIO.
And what of all this?

BIONDELLO.
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance.
Take your assurance of her, _cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum_; to
the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest
witnesses. If this be not that you look for, I have more to say, But
bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.

[_Going._]

LUCENTIO.
Hear’st thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO.
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to
the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir; and so
adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid
the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.

[_Exit._]

LUCENTIO.
I may, and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleas’d; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her;
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her:

[_Exit._]

SCENE V. A public road.

Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Hortensio and Servants.

PETRUCHIO.
Come on, i’ God’s name; once more toward our father’s.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHERINA.
The moon! The sun; it is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO.
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHERINA.
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO.
Now by my mother’s son, and that’s myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father’s house.
Go on and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross’d and cross’d; nothing but cross’d!

HORTENSIO.
Say as he says, or we shall never go.

KATHERINA.
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

PETRUCHIO.
I say it is the moon.

KATHERINA.
I know it is the moon.

PETRUCHIO.
Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.

KATHERINA.
Then, God be bless’d, it is the blessed sun;
But sun it is not when you say it is not,
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it nam’d, even that it is,
And so it shall be so for Katherine.

HORTENSIO.
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO.
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! Company is coming here.


Enter Vincentio, in a travelling dress.

[_To Vincentio_] Good morrow, gentle mistress; where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty’s sake.

HORTENSIO.
A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

KATHERINA.
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither’d,
And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.

KATHERINA.
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

PETRUCHIO.
Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.

VINCENTIO.
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amaz’d me,
My name is called Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO.
What is his name?

VINCENTIO.
Lucentio, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO.
Happily met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be not griev’d: she is of good esteem,
Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO.
But is this true? or is it else your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?

HORTENSIO.
I do assure thee, father, so it is.

PETRUCHIO.
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

[_Exeunt all but Hortensio._]

HORTENSIO.
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

[_Exit._]




ACT V

SCENE I. Padua. Before Lucentio’s house.


Enter on one side Biondello, Lucentio and Bianca; Gremio walking on
other side.

BIONDELLO.
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO.
I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at home, therefore
leave us.

BIONDELLO.
Nay, faith, I’ll see the church o’ your back; and then come back to my
master’s as soon as I can.

[_Exeunt Lucentio, Bianca and Biondello._]

GREMIO.
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.


Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Vincentio and Attendants.

PETRUCHIO.
Sir, here’s the door; this is Lucentio’s house:
My father’s bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO.
You shall not choose but drink before you go.
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.

[_Knocks._]

GREMIO.
They’re busy within; you were best knock louder.


Enter Pedant above, at a window.

PEDANT.
What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

VINCENTIO.
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

PEDANT.
He’s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

VINCENTIO.
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal?

PEDANT.
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall need none so long as I
live.

PETRUCHIO.
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do you hear, sir?
To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that
his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with
him.

PEDANT.
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the
window.

VINCENTIO.
Art thou his father?

PEDANT.
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO.
[_To Vincentio_]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this is flat knavery to
take upon you another man’s name.

PEDANT.
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a means to cozen somebody in this
city under my countenance.


Re-enter Biondello.

BIONDELLO.
I have seen them in the church together: God send ’em good shipping!
But who is here? Mine old master, Vincentio! Now we are undone and
brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO.
[_Seeing Biondello._] Come hither, crack-hemp.

BIONDELLO.
I hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO.
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO.
Forgot you! No, sir: I could not forget you, for I never saw you before
in all my life.

VINCENTIO.
What, you notorious villain! didst thou never see thy master’s father,
Vincentio?

BIONDELLO.
What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see where he looks
out of the window.

VINCENTIO.
Is’t so, indeed?

[_He beats Biondello._]

BIONDELLO.
Help, help, help! here’s a madman will murder me.

[_Exit._]

PEDANT.
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!

[_Exit from the window._]

PETRUCHIO.
Prithee, Kate, let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.

[_They retire._]


Re-enter Pedant, below; Baptista, Tranio and Servants.

TRANIO.
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

VINCENTIO.
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods! O fine
villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a
copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.

TRANIO.
How now! what’s the matter?

BAPTISTA.
What, is the man lunatic?

TRANIO.
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words
show you a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear pearl and
gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.

VINCENTIO.
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTISTA.
You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you think is his
name?

VINCENTIO.
His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since
he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.

PEDANT.
Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine only son, and
heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO.
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold on him, I charge
you, in the Duke’s name. O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain,
where is my son, Lucentio?

TRANIO.
Call forth an officer.


Enter one with an Officer.

Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge you see
that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO.
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO.
Stay, officer; he shall not go to prison.

BAPTISTA.
Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO.
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business;
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.

PEDANT.
Swear if thou darest.

GREMIO.
Nay, I dare not swear it.

TRANIO.
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

GREMIO.
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA.
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

VINCENTIO.
Thus strangers may be haled and abus’d: O monstrous villain!


Re-enter Biondello, with Lucentio and Bianca.

BIONDELLO.
O! we are spoiled; and yonder he is: deny him, forswear him, or else we
are all undone.

LUCENTIO.
[_Kneeling._] Pardon, sweet father.

VINCENTIO.
Lives my sweetest son?

[_Biondello, Tranio and Pedant run out._]

BIANCA.
[_Kneeling._] Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA.
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

LUCENTIO.
Here’s Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes blear’d thine eyne.

GREMIO.
Here ’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO.
Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
That fac’d and brav’d me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA.
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA.
Cambio is chang’d into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO.
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca’s love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arriv’d at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforc’d him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO.
I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA.
[_To Lucentio._] But do you hear, sir? Have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?

VINCENTIO.
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but I will in, to be
revenged for this villainy.

[_Exit._]

BAPTISTA.
And I to sound the depth of this knavery.

[_Exit._]

LUCENTIO.
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

[_Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca._]

GREMIO.
My cake is dough, but I’ll in among the rest;
Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.

[_Exit._]


Petruchio and Katherina advance.

KATHERINA.
Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.

PETRUCHIO.
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHERINA.
What! in the midst of the street?

PETRUCHIO.
What! art thou ashamed of me?

KATHERINA.
No, sir; God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, then, let’s home again. Come, sirrah, let’s away.

KATHERINA.
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO.
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

[_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. A room in Lucentio’s house.

Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio, Bianca,
Petruchio, Katherina, Hortensio and Widow. Tranio, Biondello and Grumio
and Others, attending.

LUCENTIO.
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
And time it is when raging war is done,
To smile at ’scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

[_They sit at table._]

PETRUCHIO.
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA.
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO.
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

HORTENSIO.
For both our sakes I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO.
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

WIDOW.
Then never trust me if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO.
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.

WIDOW.
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO.
Roundly replied.

KATHERINA.
Mistress, how mean you that?

WIDOW.
Thus I conceive by him.

PETRUCHIO.
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO.
My widow says thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO.
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHERINA.
’He that is giddy thinks the world turns round’:
I pray you tell me what you meant by that.

WIDOW.
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe;
And now you know my meaning.

KATHERINA.
A very mean meaning.

WIDOW.
Right, I mean you.

KATHERINA.
And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.

PETRUCHIO.
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO.
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO.
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO.
That’s my office.

PETRUCHIO.
Spoke like an officer: ha’ to thee, lad.

[_Drinks to Hortensio._]

BAPTISTA.
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

GREMIO.
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

BIANCA.
Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO.
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken’d you?

BIANCA.
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I’ll sleep again.

PETRUCHIO.
Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two.

BIANCA.
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.

[_Exeunt Bianca, Katherina and Widow._]

PETRUCHIO.
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio;
This bird you aim’d at, though you hit her not:
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss’d.

TRANIO.
O, sir! Lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself, and catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO.
A good swift simile, but something currish.

TRANIO.
’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA.
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO.
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO.
Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?

PETRUCHIO.
A has a little gall’d me, I confess;
And as the jest did glance away from me,
’Tis ten to one it maim’d you two outright.

BAPTISTA.
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO.
Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,
Let’s each one send unto his wife,
And he whose wife is most obedient,
To come at first when he doth send for her,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO.
Content. What’s the wager?

LUCENTIO.
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO.
Twenty crowns!
I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO.
A hundred then.

HORTENSIO.
Content.

PETRUCHIO.
A match! ’tis done.

HORTENSIO.
Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO.
That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

BIONDELLO.
I go.

[_Exit._]

BAPTISTA.
Son, I’ll be your half, Bianca comes.

LUCENTIO.
I’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.


Re-enter Biondello.

How now! what news?

BIONDELLO.
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO.
How! She’s busy, and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO.
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO.
I hope better.

HORTENSIO.
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

[_Exit Biondello._]

PETRUCHIO.
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO.
I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.


Re-enter Biondello.

Now, where’s my wife?

BIONDELLO.
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come; she bids you come to her.

PETRUCHIO.
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endur’d!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,
Say I command her come to me.

[_Exit Grumio._]

HORTENSIO.
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO.
What?

HORTENSIO.
She will not.

PETRUCHIO.
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.


Re-enter Katherina.

BAPTISTA.
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!

KATHERINA.
What is your will sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO.
Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?

KATHERINA.
They sit conferring by the parlour fire.

PETRUCHIO.
Go fetch them hither; if they deny to come,
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

[_Exit Katherina._]

LUCENTIO.
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

HORTENSIO.
And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.

PETRUCHIO.
Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
An awful rule, and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy.

BAPTISTA.
Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is chang’d, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO.
Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.


Re-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow.

Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.

[_Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down._]

WIDOW.
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

BIANCA.
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO.
I would your duty were as foolish too;
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!

BIANCA.
The more fool you for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO.
Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

WIDOW.
Come, come, you’re mocking; we will have no telling.

PETRUCHIO.
Come on, I say; and first begin with her.

WIDOW.
She shall not.

PETRUCHIO.
I say she shall: and first begin with her.

KATHERINA.
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman mov’d is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks, and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?—
I am asham’d that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband’s foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO.
Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO.
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha’t.

VINCENTIO.
’Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

LUCENTIO.
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO.
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
’Twas I won the wager,
[_To Lucentio._] though you hit the white;
And being a winner, God give you good night!

[_Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina._]

HORTENSIO.
Now go thy ways; thou hast tam’d a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO.
’Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam’d so.

[_Exeunt._]

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

CONFESSION


There is a woman in the state of Nevada to whom I once lied
continuously, consistently, and shamelessly, for the matter of a
couple of hours. I don't want to apologize to her. Far be it from me.
But I do want to explain. Unfortunately, I do not know her name, much
less her present address. If her eyes should chance upon these lines,
I hope she will write to me.

It was in Reno, Nevada, in the summer of 1892. Also, it was fair-time,
and the town was filled with petty crooks and tin-horns, to say
nothing of a vast and hungry horde of hoboes. It was the hungry hoboes
that made the town a ""hungry"" town. They ""battered"" the back doors of
the homes of the citizens until the back doors became unresponsive.

A hard town for ""scoffings,"" was what the hoboes called it at that
time. I know that I missed many a meal, in spite of the fact that I
could ""throw my feet"" with the next one when it came to ""slamming a
gate"" for a ""poke-out"" or a ""set-down,"" or hitting for a ""light piece""
on the street. Why, I was so hard put in that town, one day, that I
gave the porter the slip and invaded the private car of some itinerant
millionnaire. The train started as I made the platform, and I headed
for the aforesaid millionnaire with the porter one jump behind and
reaching for me. It was a dead heat, for I reached the millionnaire at
the same instant that the porter reached me. I had no time for
formalities. ""Gimme a quarter to eat on,"" I blurted out. And as I
live, that millionnaire dipped into his pocket and gave me ... just
... precisely ... a quarter. It is my conviction that he was so
flabbergasted that he obeyed automatically, and it has been a matter
of keen regret ever since, on my part, that I didn't ask him for a
dollar. I know that I'd have got it. I swung off the platform of that
private car with the porter manoeuvring to kick me in the face. He
missed me. One is at a terrible disadvantage when trying to swing off
the lowest step of a car and not break his neck on the right of way,
with, at the same time, an irate Ethiopian on the platform above
trying to land him in the face with a number eleven. But I got the
quarter! I got it!

But to return to the woman to whom I so shamelessly lied. It was in
the evening of my last day in Reno. I had been out to the race-track
watching the ponies run, and had missed my dinner (_i.e._ the mid-day
meal). I was hungry, and, furthermore, a committee of public safety
had just been organized to rid the town of just such hungry mortals as
I. Already a lot of my brother hoboes had been gathered in by John
Law, and I could hear the sunny valleys of California calling to me
over the cold crests of the Sierras. Two acts remained for me to
perform before I shook the dust of Reno from my feet. One was to catch
the blind baggage on the westbound overland that night. The other was
first to get something to eat. Even youth will hesitate at an
all-night ride, on an empty stomach, outside a train that is tearing
the atmosphere through the snow-sheds, tunnels, and eternal snows of
heaven-aspiring mountains.

But that something to eat was a hard proposition. I was ""turned down""
at a dozen houses. Sometimes I received insulting remarks and was
informed of the barred domicile that should be mine if I had my just
deserts. The worst of it was that such assertions were only too true.
That was why I was pulling west that night. John Law was abroad in the
town, seeking eagerly for the hungry and homeless, for by such was his
barred domicile tenanted.

At other houses the doors were slammed in my face, cutting short my
politely and humbly couched request for something to eat. At one house
they did not open the door. I stood on the porch and knocked, and they
looked out at me through the window. They even held one sturdy little
boy aloft so that he could see over the shoulders of his elders the
tramp who wasn't going to get anything to eat at their house.

It began to look as if I should be compelled to go to the very poor
for my food. The very poor constitute the last sure recourse of the
hungry tramp. The very poor can always be depended upon. They never
turn away the hungry. Time and again, all over the United States, have
I been refused food by the big house on the hill; and always have I
received food from the little shack down by the creek or marsh, with
its broken windows stuffed with rags and its tired-faced mother broken
with labor. Oh, you charity-mongers! Go to the poor and learn, for the
poor alone are the charitable. They neither give nor withhold from
their excess. They have no excess. They give, and they withhold never,
from what they need for themselves, and very often from what they
cruelly need for themselves. A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity
is the bone shared with the dog when you are just as hungry as the
dog.

There was one house in particular where I was turned down that
evening. The porch windows opened on the dining room, and through them
I saw a man eating pie--a big meat-pie. I stood in the open door, and
while he talked with me, he went on eating. He was prosperous, and out
of his prosperity had been bred resentment against his less fortunate
brothers.

He cut short my request for something to eat, snapping out, ""I don't
believe you want to work.""

Now this was irrelevant. I hadn't said anything about work. The topic
of conversation I had introduced was ""food."" In fact, I didn't want to
work. I wanted to take the westbound overland that night.

""You wouldn't work if you had a chance,"" he bullied.

I glanced at his meek-faced wife, and knew that but for the presence
of this Cerberus I'd have a whack at that meat-pie myself. But
Cerberus sopped himself in the pie, and I saw that I must placate him
if I were to get a share of it. So I sighed to myself and accepted his
work-morality.

""Of course I want work,"" I bluffed.

""Don't believe it,"" he snorted.

""Try me,"" I answered, warming to the bluff.

""All right,"" he said. ""Come to the corner of blank and blank
streets""--(I have forgotten the address)--""to-morrow morning. You know
where that burned building is, and I'll put you to work tossing
bricks.""

""All right, sir; I'll be there.""

He grunted and went on eating. I waited. After a couple of minutes he
looked up with an I-thought-you-were-gone expression on his face, and
demanded:--

""Well?""

""I ... I am waiting for something to eat,"" I said gently.

""I knew you wouldn't work!"" he roared.

He was right, of course; but his conclusion must have been reached by
mind-reading, for his logic wouldn't bear it out. But the beggar at
the door must be humble, so I accepted his logic as I had accepted his
morality.

""You see, I am now hungry,"" I said still gently. ""To-morrow morning I
shall be hungrier. Think how hungry I shall be when I have tossed
bricks all day without anything to eat. Now if you will give me
something to eat, I'll be in great shape for those bricks.""

He gravely considered my plea, at the same time going on eating, while
his wife nearly trembled into propitiatory speech, but refrained.

""I'll tell you what I'll do,"" he said between mouthfuls. ""You come to
work to-morrow, and in the middle of the day I'll advance you enough
for your dinner. That will show whether you are in earnest or not.""

""In the meantime--"" I began; but he interrupted.

""If I gave you something to eat now, I'd never see you again. Oh, I
know your kind. Look at me. I owe no man. I have never descended so
low as to ask any one for food. I have always earned my food. The
trouble with you is that you are idle and dissolute. I can see it in
your face. I have worked and been honest. I have made myself what I
am. And you can do the same, if you work and are honest.""

""Like you?"" I queried.

Alas, no ray of humor had ever penetrated the sombre work-sodden soul
of that man.

""Yes, like me,"" he answered.

""All of us?"" I queried.

""Yes, all of you,"" he answered, conviction vibrating in his voice.

""But if we all became like you,"" I said, ""allow me to point out that
there'd be nobody to toss bricks for you.""

I swear there was a flicker of a smile in his wife's eye. As for him,
he was aghast--but whether at the awful possibility of a reformed
humanity that would not enable him to get anybody to toss bricks for
him, or at my impudence, I shall never know.

""I'll not waste words on you,"" he roared. ""Get out of here, you
ungrateful whelp!""

I scraped my feet to advertise my intention of going, and queried:--

""And I don't get anything to eat?""

He arose suddenly to his feet. He was a large man. I was a stranger in
a strange land, and John Law was looking for me. I went away
hurriedly. ""But why ungrateful?"" I asked myself as I slammed his gate.
""What in the dickens did he give me to be ungrateful about?"" I looked
back. I could still see him through the window. He had returned to his
pie.

By this time I had lost heart. I passed many houses by without
venturing up to them. All houses looked alike, and none looked ""good.""
After walking half a dozen blocks I shook off my despondency and
gathered my ""nerve."" This begging for food was all a game, and if I
didn't like the cards, I could always call for a new deal. I made up
my mind to tackle the next house. I approached it in the deepening
twilight, going around to the kitchen door.

I knocked softly, and when I saw the kind face of the middle-aged
woman who answered, as by inspiration came to me the ""story"" I was to
tell. For know that upon his ability to tell a good story depends the
success of the beggar. First of all, and on the instant, the beggar
must ""size up"" his victim. After that, he must tell a story that will
appeal to the peculiar personality and temperament of that particular
victim. And right here arises the great difficulty: in the instant
that he is sizing up the victim he must begin his story. Not a minute
is allowed for preparation. As in a lightning flash he must divine the
nature of the victim and conceive a tale that will hit home. The
successful hobo must be an artist. He must create spontaneously and
instantaneously--and not upon a theme selected from the plenitude of
his own imagination, but upon the theme he reads in the face of the
person who opens the door, be it man, woman, or child, sweet or
crabbed, generous or miserly, good-natured or cantankerous, Jew or
Gentile, black or white, race-prejudiced or brotherly, provincial or
universal, or whatever else it may be. I have often thought that to
this training of my tramp days is due much of my success as a
story-writer. In order to get the food whereby I lived, I was
compelled to tell tales that rang true. At the back door, out of
inexorable necessity, is developed the convincingness and sincerity
laid down by all authorities on the art of the short-story. Also, I
quite believe it was my tramp-apprenticeship that made a realist out
of me. Realism constitutes the only goods one can exchange at the
kitchen door for grub.

After all, art is only consummate artfulness, and artfulness saves
many a ""story."" I remember lying in a police station at Winnipeg,
Manitoba. I was bound west over the Canadian Pacific. Of course, the
police wanted my story, and I gave it to them--on the spur of the
moment. They were landlubbers, in the heart of the continent, and what
better story for them than a sea story? They could never trip me up on
that. And so I told a tearful tale of my life on the hell-ship
_Glenmore_. (I had once seen the _Glenmore_ lying at anchor in San
Francisco Bay.)

I was an English apprentice, I said. And they said that I didn't talk
like an English boy. It was up to me to create on the instant. I had
been born and reared in the United States. On the death of my parents,
I had been sent to England to my grandparents. It was they who had
apprenticed me on the _Glenmore_. I hope the captain of the _Glenmore_
will forgive me, for I gave him a character that night in the Winnipeg
police station. Such cruelty! Such brutality! Such diabolical
ingenuity of torture! It explained why I had deserted the _Glenmore_
at Montreal.

But why was I in the middle of Canada going west, when my grandparents
lived in England? Promptly I created a married sister who lived in
California. She would take care of me. I developed at length her
loving nature. But they were not done with me, those hard-hearted
policemen. I had joined the _Glenmore_ in England; in the two years
that had elapsed before my desertion at Montreal, what had the
_Glenmore_ done and where had she been? And thereat I took those
landlubbers around the world with me. Buffeted by pounding seas and
stung with flying spray, they fought a typhoon with me off the coast
of Japan. They loaded and unloaded cargo with me in all the ports of
the Seven Seas. I took them to India, and Rangoon, and China, and had
them hammer ice with me around the Horn and at last come to moorings
at Montreal.

And then they said to wait a moment, and one policeman went forth into
the night while I warmed myself at the stove, all the while racking my
brains for the trap they were going to spring on me.

I groaned to myself when I saw him come in the door at the heels of
the policeman. No gypsy prank had thrust those tiny hoops of gold
through the ears; no prairie winds had beaten that skin into wrinkled
leather; nor had snow-drift and mountain-slope put in his walk that
reminiscent roll. And in those eyes, when they looked at me, I saw the
unmistakable sun-wash of the sea. Here was a theme, alas! with half a
dozen policemen to watch me read--I who had never sailed the China
seas, nor been around the Horn, nor looked with my eyes upon India and
Rangoon.

I was desperate. Disaster stalked before me incarnate in the form of
that gold-ear-ringed, weather-beaten son of the sea. Who was he? What
was he? I must solve him ere he solved me. I must take a new
orientation, or else those wicked policemen would orientate me to a
cell, a police court, and more cells. If he questioned me first,
before I knew how much he knew, I was lost.

But did I betray my desperate plight to those lynx-eyed guardians of
the public welfare of Winnipeg? Not I. I met that aged sailorman
glad-eyed and beaming, with all the simulated relief at deliverance
that a drowning man would display on finding a life-preserver in his
last despairing clutch. Here was a man who understood and who would
verify my true story to the faces of those sleuth-hounds who did not
understand, or, at least, such was what I endeavored to play-act. I
seized upon him; I volleyed him with questions about himself. Before
my judges I would prove the character of my savior before he saved me.

He was a kindly sailorman--an ""easy mark."" The policemen grew
impatient while I questioned him. At last one of them told me to shut
up. I shut up; but while I remained shut up, I was busy creating, busy
sketching the scenario of the next act. I had learned enough to go on
with. He was a Frenchman. He had sailed always on French merchant
vessels, with the one exception of a voyage on a ""lime-juicer."" And
last of all--blessed fact!--he had not been on the sea for twenty
years.

The policeman urged him on to examine me.

""You called in at Rangoon?"" he queried.

I nodded. ""We put our third mate ashore there. Fever.""

If he had asked me what kind of fever, I should have answered,
""Enteric,"" though for the life of me I didn't know what enteric was.
But he didn't ask me. Instead, his next question was:--

""And how is Rangoon?""

""All right. It rained a whole lot when we were there.""

""Did you get shore-leave?""

""Sure,"" I answered. ""Three of us apprentices went ashore together.""

""Do you remember the temple?""

""Which temple?"" I parried.

""The big one, at the top of the stairway.""

If I remembered that temple, I knew I'd have to describe it. The gulf
yawned for me.

I shook my head.

""You can see it from all over the harbor,"" he informed me. ""You don't
need shore-leave to see that temple.""

I never loathed a temple so in my life. But I fixed that particular
temple at Rangoon.

""You can't see it from the harbor,"" I contradicted. ""You can't see it
from the town. You can't see it from the top of the stairway.
Because--"" I paused for the effect. ""Because there isn't any temple
there.""

""But I saw it with my own eyes!"" he cried.

""That was in--?"" I queried.

""Seventy-one.""

""It was destroyed in the great earthquake of 1887,"" I explained. ""It
was very old.""

There was a pause. He was busy reconstructing in his old eyes the
youthful vision of that fair temple by the sea.

""The stairway is still there,"" I aided him. ""You can see it from all
over the harbor. And you remember that little island on the right-hand
side coming into the harbor?"" I guess there must have been one there
(I was prepared to shift it over to the left-hand side), for he
nodded. ""Gone,"" I said. ""Seven fathoms of water there now.""

I had gained a moment for breath. While he pondered on time's changes,
I prepared the finishing touches of my story.

""You remember the custom-house at Bombay?""

He remembered it.

""Burned to the ground,"" I announced.

""Do you remember Jim Wan?"" he came back at me.

""Dead,"" I said; but who the devil Jim Wan was I hadn't the slightest
idea.

I was on thin ice again.

""Do you remember Billy Harper, at Shanghai?"" I queried back at him
quickly.

That aged sailorman worked hard to recollect, but the Billy Harper of
my imagination was beyond his faded memory.

""Of course you remember Billy Harper,"" I insisted. ""Everybody knows
him. He's been there forty years. Well, he's still there, that's all.""

And then the miracle happened. The sailorman remembered Billy Harper.
Perhaps there was a Billy Harper, and perhaps he had been in Shanghai
for forty years and was still there; but it was news to me.

For fully half an hour longer, the sailorman and I talked on in
similar fashion. In the end he told the policemen that I was what I
represented myself to be, and after a night's lodging and a breakfast
I was released to wander on westward to my married sister in San
Francisco.

But to return to the woman in Reno who opened her door to me in the
deepening twilight. At the first glimpse of her kindly face I took my
cue. I became a sweet, innocent, unfortunate lad. I couldn't speak. I
opened my mouth and closed it again. Never in my life before had I
asked any one for food. My embarrassment was painful, extreme. I was
ashamed. I, who looked upon begging as a delightful whimsicality,
thumbed myself over into a true son of Mrs. Grundy, burdened with all
her bourgeois morality. Only the harsh pangs of the belly-need could
compel me to do so degraded and ignoble a thing as beg for food. And
into my face I strove to throw all the wan wistfulness of famished and
ingenuous youth unused to mendicancy.

""You are hungry, my poor boy,"" she said.

I had made her speak first.

I nodded my head and gulped.

""It is the first time I have ever ... asked,"" I faltered.

""Come right in."" The door swung open. ""We have already finished
eating, but the fire is burning and I can get something up for you.""

She looked at me closely when she got me into the light.

""I wish my boy were as healthy and strong as you,"" she said. ""But he
is not strong. He sometimes falls down. He just fell down this
afternoon and hurt himself badly, the poor dear.""

She mothered him with her voice, with an ineffable tenderness in it
that I yearned to appropriate. I glanced at him. He sat across the
table, slender and pale, his head swathed in bandages. He did not
move, but his eyes, bright in the lamplight, were fixed upon me in a
steady and wondering stare.

""Just like my poor father,"" I said. ""He had the falling sickness. Some
kind of vertigo. It puzzled the doctors. They never could make out
what was the matter with him.""

""He is dead?"" she queried gently, setting before me half a dozen
soft-boiled eggs.

""Dead,"" I gulped. ""Two weeks ago. I was with him when it happened. We
were crossing the street together. He fell right down. He was never
conscious again. They carried him into a drug-store. He died there.""

And thereat I developed the pitiful tale of my father--how, after my
mother's death, he and I had gone to San Francisco from the ranch; how
his pension (he was an old soldier), and the little other money he
had, was not enough; and how he had tried book-canvassing. Also, I
narrated my own woes during the few days after his death that I had
spent alone and forlorn on the streets of San Francisco. While that
good woman warmed up biscuits, fried bacon, and cooked more eggs, and
while I kept pace with her in taking care of all that she placed
before me, I enlarged the picture of that poor orphan boy and filled
in the details. I became that poor boy. I believed in him as I
believed in the beautiful eggs I was devouring. I could have wept for
myself. I know the tears did get into my voice at times. It was very
effective.

In fact, with every touch I added to the picture, that kind soul gave
me something also. She made up a lunch for me to carry away. She put
in many boiled eggs, pepper and salt, and other things, and a big
apple. She provided me with three pairs of thick red woollen socks.
She gave me clean handkerchiefs and other things which I have since
forgotten. And all the time she cooked more and more and I ate more
and more. I gorged like a savage; but then it was a far cry across the
Sierras on a blind baggage, and I knew not when nor where I should
find my next meal. And all the while, like a death's-head at the
feast, silent and motionless, her own unfortunate boy sat and stared
at me across the table. I suppose I represented to him mystery, and
romance, and adventure--all that was denied the feeble flicker of life
that was in him. And yet I could not forbear, once or twice, from
wondering if he saw through me down to the bottom of my mendacious
heart.

""But where are you going to?"" she asked me.

""Salt Lake City,"" said I. ""I have a sister there--a married sister.""
(I debated if I should make a Mormon out of her, and decided against
it.) ""Her husband is a plumber--a contracting plumber.""

Now I knew that contracting plumbers were usually credited with making
lots of money. But I had spoken. It was up to me to qualify.

""They would have sent me the money for my fare if I had asked for it,""
I explained, ""but they have had sickness and business troubles. His
partner cheated him. And so I wouldn't write for the money. I knew I
could make my way there somehow. I let them think I had enough to get
me to Salt Lake City. She is lovely, and so kind. She was always kind
to me. I guess I'll go into the shop and learn the trade. She has two
daughters. They are younger than I. One is only a baby.""

Of all my married sisters that I have distributed among the cities of
the United States, that Salt Lake sister is my favorite. She is quite
real, too. When I tell about her, I can see her, and her two little
girls, and her plumber husband. She is a large, motherly woman, just
verging on beneficent stoutness--the kind, you know, that always cooks
nice things and that never gets angry. She is a brunette. Her husband
is a quiet, easy-going fellow. Sometimes I almost know him quite
well. And who knows but some day I may meet him? If that aged
sailorman could remember Billy Harper, I see no reason why I should
not some day meet the husband of my sister who lives in Salt Lake
City.

On the other hand, I have a feeling of certitude within me that I
shall never meet in the flesh my many parents and grandparents--you
see, I invariably killed them off. Heart disease was my favorite way
of getting rid of my mother, though on occasion I did away with her by
means of consumption, pneumonia, and typhoid fever. It is true, as the
Winnipeg policemen will attest, that I have grandparents living in
England; but that was a long time ago and it is a fair assumption that
they are dead by now. At any rate, they have never written to me.

I hope that woman in Reno will read these lines and forgive me my
gracelessness and unveracity. I do not apologize, for I am unashamed.
It was youth, delight in life, zest for experience, that brought me to
her door. It did me good. It taught me the intrinsic kindliness of
human nature. I hope it did her good. Anyway, she may get a good laugh
out of it now that she learns the real inwardness of the situation.

To her my story was ""true."" She believed in me and all my family, and
she was filled with solicitude for the dangerous journey I must make
ere I won to Salt Lake City. This solicitude nearly brought me to
grief. Just as I was leaving, my arms full of lunch and my pockets
bulging with fat woollen socks, she bethought herself of a nephew, or
uncle, or relative of some sort, who was in the railway mail service,
and who, moreover, would come through that night on the very train on
which I was going to steal my ride. The very thing! She would take me
down to the depot, tell him my story, and get him to hide me in the
mail car. Thus, without danger or hardship, I would be carried
straight through to Ogden. Salt Lake City was only a few miles farther
on. My heart sank. She grew excited as she developed the plan and with
my sinking heart I had to feign unbounded gladness and enthusiasm at
this solution of my difficulties.

Solution! Why I was bound west that night, and here was I being
trapped into going east. It _was_ a trap, and I hadn't the heart to
tell her that it was all a miserable lie. And while I made believe
that I was delighted, I was busy cudgelling my brains for some way to
escape. But there was no way. She would see me into the mail-car--she
said so herself--and then that mail-clerk relative of hers would carry
me to Ogden. And then I would have to beat my way back over all those
hundreds of miles of desert.

But luck was with me that night. Just about the time she was getting
ready to put on her bonnet and accompany me, she discovered that she
had made a mistake. Her mail-clerk relative was not scheduled to come
through that night. His run had been changed. He would not come
through until two nights afterward. I was saved, for of course my
boundless youth would never permit me to wait those two days. I
optimistically assured her that I'd get to Salt Lake City quicker if I
started immediately, and I departed with her blessings and best wishes
ringing in my ears.

But those woollen socks were great. I know. I wore a pair of them that
night on the blind baggage of the overland, and that overland went
west.




HOLDING HER DOWN


Barring accidents, a good hobo, with youth and agility, can hold a
train down despite all the efforts of the train-crew to ""ditch""
him--given, of course, night-time as an essential condition. When such
a hobo, under such conditions, makes up his mind that he is going to
hold her down, either he does hold her down, or chance trips him up.
There is no legitimate way, short of murder, whereby the train-crew
can ditch him. That train-crews have not stopped short of murder is a
current belief in the tramp world. Not having had that particular
experience in my tramp days I cannot vouch for it personally.

But this I have heard of the ""bad"" roads. When a tramp has ""gone
underneath,"" on the rods, and the train is in motion, there is
apparently no way of dislodging him until the train stops. The tramp,
snugly ensconced inside the truck, with the four wheels and all the
framework around him, has the ""cinch"" on the crew--or so he thinks,
until some day he rides the rods on a bad road. A bad road is usually
one on which a short time previously one or several trainmen have been
killed by tramps. Heaven pity the tramp who is caught ""underneath"" on
such a road--for caught he is, though the train be going sixty miles
an hour.

The ""shack"" (brakeman) takes a coupling-pin and a length of bell-cord
to the platform in front of the truck in which the tramp is riding.
The shack fastens the coupling-pin to the bell-cord, drops the former
down between the platforms, and pays out the latter. The coupling-pin
strikes the ties between the rails, rebounds against the bottom of the
car, and again strikes the ties. The shack plays it back and forth,
now to this side, now to the other, lets it out a bit and hauls it in
a bit, giving his weapon opportunity for every variety of impact and
rebound. Every blow of that flying coupling-pin is freighted with
death, and at sixty miles an hour it beats a veritable tattoo of
death. The next day the remains of that tramp are gathered up along
the right of way, and a line in the local paper mentions the unknown
man, undoubtedly a tramp, assumably drunk, who had probably fallen
asleep on the track.

As a characteristic illustration of how a capable hobo can hold her
down, I am minded to give the following experience. I was in Ottawa,
bound west over the Canadian Pacific. Three thousand miles of that
road stretched before me; it was the fall of the year, and I had to
cross Manitoba and the Rocky Mountains. I could expect ""crimpy""
weather, and every moment of delay increased the frigid hardships of
the journey. Furthermore, I was disgusted. The distance between
Montreal and Ottawa is one hundred and twenty miles. I ought to know,
for I had just come over it and it had taken me six days. By mistake I
had missed the main line and come over a small ""jerk"" with only two
locals a day on it. And during these six days I had lived on dry
crusts, and not enough of them, begged from the French peasants.

Furthermore, my disgust had been heightened by the one day I had spent
in Ottawa trying to get an outfit of clothing for my long journey. Let
me put it on record right here that Ottawa, with one exception, is the
hardest town in the United States and Canada to beg clothes in; the
one exception is Washington, D.C. The latter fair city is the limit. I
spent two weeks there trying to beg a pair of shoes, and then had to
go on to Jersey City before I got them.

But to return to Ottawa. At eight sharp in the morning I started out
after clothes. I worked energetically all day. I swear I walked forty
miles. I interviewed the housewives of a thousand homes. I did not
even knock off work for dinner. And at six in the afternoon, after ten
hours of unremitting and depressing toil, I was still shy one shirt,
while the pair of trousers I had managed to acquire was tight and,
moreover, was showing all the signs of an early disintegration.

At six I quit work and headed for the railroad yards, expecting to
pick up something to eat on the way. But my hard luck was still with
me. I was refused food at house after house. Then I got a ""hand-out.""
My spirits soared, for it was the largest hand-out I had ever seen in
a long and varied experience. It was a parcel wrapped in newspapers
and as big as a mature suit-case. I hurried to a vacant lot and opened
it. First, I saw cake, then more cake, all kinds and makes of cake,
and then some. It was all cake. No bread and butter with thick firm
slices of meat between--nothing but cake; and I who of all things
abhorred cake most! In another age and clime they sat down by the
waters of Babylon and wept. And in a vacant lot in Canada's proud
capital, I, too, sat down and wept ... over a mountain of cake. As one
looks upon the face of his dead son, so looked I upon that
multitudinous pastry. I suppose I was an ungrateful tramp, for I
refused to partake of the bounteousness of the house that had had a
party the night before. Evidently the guests hadn't liked cake either.

That cake marked the crisis in my fortunes. Than it nothing could be
worse; therefore things must begin to mend. And they did. At the very
next house I was given a ""set-down."" Now a ""set-down"" is the height of
bliss. One is taken inside, very often is given a chance to wash, and
is then ""set-down"" at a table. Tramps love to throw their legs under a
table. The house was large and comfortable, in the midst of spacious
grounds and fine trees, and sat well back from the street. They had
just finished eating, and I was taken right into the dining room--in
itself a most unusual happening, for the tramp who is lucky enough to
win a set-down usually receives it in the kitchen. A grizzled and
gracious Englishman, his matronly wife, and a beautiful young
Frenchwoman talked with me while I ate.

I wonder if that beautiful young Frenchwoman would remember, at this
late day, the laugh I gave her when I uttered the barbaric phrase,
""two-bits."" You see, I was trying delicately to hit them for a ""light
piece."" That was how the sum of money came to be mentioned. ""What?""
she said. ""Two-bits,"" said I. Her mouth was twitching as she again
said, ""What?"" ""Two-bits,"" said I. Whereat she burst into laughter.
""Won't you repeat it?"" she said, when she had regained control of
herself. ""Two-bits,"" said I. And once more she rippled into
uncontrollable silvery laughter. ""I beg your pardon,"" said she; ""but
what ... what was it you said?"" ""Two-bits,"" said I; ""is there anything
wrong about it?"" ""Not that I know of,"" she gurgled between gasps; ""but
what does it mean?"" I explained, but I do not remember now whether or
not I got that two-bits out of her; but I have often wondered since
as to which of us was the provincial.

When I arrived at the depot, I found, much to my disgust, a bunch of
at least twenty tramps that were waiting to ride out the blind
baggages of the overland. Now two or three tramps on the blind baggage
are all right. They are inconspicuous. But a score! That meant
trouble. No train-crew would ever let all of us ride.

I may as well explain here what a blind baggage is. Some mail-cars are
built without doors in the ends; hence, such a car is ""blind."" The
mail-cars that possess end doors, have those doors always locked.
Suppose, after the train has started, that a tramp gets on to the
platform of one of these blind cars. There is no door, or the door is
locked. No conductor or brakeman can get to him to collect fare or
throw him off. It is clear that the tramp is safe until the next time
the train stops. Then he must get off, run ahead in the darkness, and
when the train pulls by, jump on to the blind again. But there are
ways and ways, as you shall see.

When the train pulled out, those twenty tramps swarmed upon the three
blinds. Some climbed on before the train had run a car-length. They
were awkward dubs, and I saw their speedy finish. Of course, the
train-crew was ""on,"" and at the first stop the trouble began. I jumped
off and ran forward along the track. I noticed that I was accompanied
by a number of the tramps. They evidently knew their business. When
one is beating an overland, he must always keep well ahead of the
train at the stops. I ran ahead, and as I ran, one by one those that
accompanied me dropped out. This dropping out was the measure of their
skill and nerve in boarding a train.

For this is the way it works. When the train starts, the shack rides
out the blind. There is no way for him to get back into the train
proper except by jumping off the blind and catching a platform where
the car-ends are not ""blind."" When the train is going as fast as the
shack cares to risk, he therefore jumps off the blind, lets several
cars go by, and gets on to the train. So it is up to the tramp to run
so far ahead that before the blind is opposite him the shack will have
already vacated it.

I dropped the last tramp by about fifty feet, and waited. The train
started. I saw the lantern of the shack on the first blind. He was
riding her out. And I saw the dubs stand forlornly by the track as the
blind went by. They made no attempt to get on. They were beaten by
their own inefficiency at the very start. After them, in the line-up,
came the tramps that knew a little something about the game. They let
the first blind, occupied by the shack, go by, and jumped on the
second and third blinds. Of course, the shack jumped off the first and
on to the second as it went by, and scrambled around there, throwing
off the men who had boarded it. But the point is that I was so far
ahead that when the first blind came opposite me, the shack had
already left it and was tangled up with the tramps on the second
blind. A half dozen of the more skilful tramps, who had run far enough
ahead, made the first blind, too.

At the next stop, as we ran forward along the track, I counted but
fifteen of us. Five had been ditched. The weeding-out process had
begun nobly, and it continued station by station. Now we were
fourteen, now twelve, now eleven, now nine, now eight. It reminded me
of the ten little niggers of the nursery rhyme. I was resolved that I
should be the last little nigger of all. And why not? Was I not
blessed with strength, agility, and youth? (I was eighteen, and in
perfect condition.) And didn't I have my ""nerve"" with me? And
furthermore, was I not a tramp-royal? Were not these other tramps mere
dubs and ""gay-cats"" and amateurs alongside of me? If I weren't the
last little nigger, I might as well quit the game and get a job on an
alfalfa farm somewhere.

By the time our number had been reduced to four, the whole train-crew
had become interested. From then on it was a contest of skill and
wits, with the odds in favor of the crew. One by one the three other
survivors turned up missing, until I alone remained. My, but I was
proud of myself! No Croesus was ever prouder of his first million. I
was holding her down in spite of two brakemen, a conductor, a fireman,
and an engineer.

And here are a few samples of the way I held her down. Out ahead, in
the darkness,--so far ahead that the shack riding out the blind must
perforce get off before it reaches me,--I get on. Very well. I am
good for another station. When that station is reached, I dart ahead
again to repeat the manoeuvre. The train pulls out. I watch her
coming. There is no light of a lantern on the blind. Has the crew
abandoned the fight? I do not know. One never knows, and one must be
prepared every moment for anything. As the first blind comes opposite
me, and I run to leap aboard, I strain my eyes to see if the shack is
on the platform. For all I know he may be there, with his lantern
doused, and even as I spring upon the steps that lantern may smash
down upon my head. I ought to know. I have been hit by lanterns two or
three times.

But no, the first blind is empty. The train is gathering speed. I am
safe for another station. But am I? I feel the train slacken speed. On
the instant I am alert. A manoeuvre is being executed against me, and
I do not know what it is. I try to watch on both sides at once, not
forgetting to keep track of the tender in front of me. From any one,
or all, of these three directions, I may be assailed.

Ah, there it comes. The shack has ridden out the engine. My first
warning is when his feet strike the steps of the right-hand side of
the blind. Like a flash I am off the blind to the left and running
ahead past the engine. I lose myself in the darkness. The situation is
where it has been ever since the train left Ottawa. I am ahead, and
the train must come past me if it is to proceed on its journey. I have
as good a chance as ever for boarding her.

I watch carefully. I see a lantern come forward to the engine, and I
do not see it go back from the engine. It must therefore be still on
the engine, and it is a fair assumption that attached to the handle of
that lantern is a shack. That shack was lazy, or else he would have
put out his lantern instead of trying to shield it as he came forward.
The train pulls out. The first blind is empty, and I gain it. As
before the train slackens, the shack from the engine boards the blind
from one side, and I go off the other side and run forward.

As I wait in the darkness I am conscious of a big thrill of pride. The
overland has stopped twice for me--for me, a poor hobo on the bum. I
alone have twice stopped the overland with its many passengers and
coaches, its government mail, and its two thousand steam horses
straining in the engine. And I weigh only one hundred and sixty
pounds, and I haven't a five-cent piece in my pocket!

Again I see the lantern come forward to the engine. But this time it
comes conspicuously. A bit too conspicuously to suit me, and I wonder
what is up. At any rate I have something else to be afraid of than the
shack on the engine. The train pulls by. Just in time, before I make
my spring, I see the dark form of a shack, without a lantern, on the
first blind. I let it go by, and prepare to board the second blind.
But the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels.
Also, I have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode
out the engine. He has jumped off, and now both shacks are on the
ground on the same side with me. The next moment the second blind
comes by and I am aboard it. But I do not linger. I have figured out
my countermove. As I dash across the platform I hear the impact of the
shack's feet against the steps as he boards. I jump off the other side
and run forward with the train. My plan is to run forward and get on
the first blind. It is nip and tuck, for the train is gathering speed.
Also, the shack is behind me and running after me. I guess I am the
better sprinter, for I make the first blind. I stand on the steps and
watch my pursuer. He is only about ten feet back and running hard; but
now the train has approximated his own speed, and, relative to me, he
is standing still. I encourage him, hold out my hand to him; but he
explodes in a mighty oath, gives up and makes the train several cars
back.

The train is speeding along, and I am still chuckling to myself, when,
without warning, a spray of water strikes me. The fireman is playing
the hose on me from the engine. I step forward from the car-platform
to the rear of the tender, where I am sheltered under the overhang.
The water flies harmlessly over my head. My fingers itch to climb up
on the tender and lam that fireman with a chunk of coal; but I know if
I do that, I'll be massacred by him and the engineer, and I refrain.

At the next stop I am off and ahead in the darkness. This time, when
the train pulls out, both shacks are on the first blind. I divine
their game. They have blocked the repetition of my previous play. I
cannot again take the second blind, cross over, and run forward to
the first. As soon as the first blind passes and I do not get on, they
swing off, one on each side of the train. I board the second blind,
and as I do so I know that a moment later, simultaneously, those two
shacks will arrive on both sides of me. It is like a trap. Both ways
are blocked. Yet there is another way out, and that way is up.

So I do not wait for my pursuers to arrive. I climb upon the upright
ironwork of the platform and stand upon the wheel of the hand-brake.
This has taken up the moment of grace and I hear the shacks strike the
steps on either side. I don't stop to look. I raise my arms overhead
until my hands rest against the down-curving ends of the roofs of the
two cars. One hand, of course, is on the curved roof of one car, the
other hand on the curved roof of the other car. By this time both
shacks are coming up the steps. I know it, though I am too busy to see
them. All this is happening in the space of only several seconds. I
make a spring with my legs and ""muscle"" myself up with my arms. As I
draw up my legs, both shacks reach for me and clutch empty air. I know
this, for I look down and see them. Also I hear them swear.

I am now in a precarious position, riding the ends of the down-curving
roofs of two cars at the same time. With a quick, tense movement, I
transfer both legs to the curve of one roof and both hands to the
curve of the other roof. Then, gripping the edge of that curving roof,
I climb over the curve to the level roof above, where I sit down to
catch my breath, holding on the while to a ventilator that projects
above the surface. I am on top of the train--on the ""decks,"" as the
tramps call it, and this process I have described is by them called
""decking her."" And let me say right here that only a young and
vigorous tramp is able to deck a passenger train, and also, that the
young and vigorous tramp must have his nerve with him as well.

The train goes on gathering speed, and I know I am safe until the next
stop--but only until the next stop. If I remain on the roof after the
train stops, I know those shacks will fusillade me with rocks. A
healthy shack can ""dewdrop"" a pretty heavy chunk of stone on top of a
car--say anywhere from five to twenty pounds. On the other hand, the
chances are large that at the next stop the shacks will be waiting for
me to descend at the place I climbed up. It is up to me to climb down
at some other platform.

Registering a fervent hope that there are no tunnels in the next half
mile, I rise to my feet and walk down the train half a dozen cars. And
let me say that one must leave timidity behind him on such a
_passear_. The roofs of passenger coaches are not made for midnight
promenades. And if any one thinks they are, let me advise him to try
it. Just let him walk along the roof of a jolting, lurching car, with
nothing to hold on to but the black and empty air, and when he comes
to the down-curving end of the roof, all wet and slippery with dew,
let him accelerate his speed so as to step across to the next roof,
down-curving and wet and slippery. Believe me, he will learn whether
his heart is weak or his head is giddy.

As the train slows down for a stop, half a dozen platforms from where
I had decked her I come down. No one is on the platform. When the
train comes to a standstill, I slip off to the ground. Ahead, and
between me and the engine, are two moving lanterns. The shacks are
looking for me on the roofs of the cars. I note that the car beside
which I am standing is a ""four-wheeler""--by which is meant that it has
only four wheels to each truck. (When you go underneath on the rods,
be sure to avoid the ""six-wheelers,""--they lead to disasters.)

I duck under the train and make for the rods, and I can tell you I am
mighty glad that the train is standing still. It is the first time I
have ever gone underneath on the Canadian Pacific, and the internal
arrangements are new to me. I try to crawl over the top of the truck,
between the truck and the bottom of the car. But the space is not
large enough for me to squeeze through. This is new to me. Down in the
United States I am accustomed to going underneath on rapidly moving
trains, seizing a gunnel and swinging my feet under to the brake-beam,
and from there crawling over the top of the truck and down inside the
truck to a seat on the cross-rod.

Feeling with my hands in the darkness, I learn that there is room
between the brake-beam and the ground. It is a tight squeeze. I have
to lie flat and worm my way through. Once inside the truck, I take my
seat on the rod and wonder what the shacks are thinking has become of
me. The train gets under way. They have given me up at last.

But have they? At the very next stop, I see a lantern thrust under
the next truck to mine at the other end of the car. They are searching
the rods for me. I must make my get-away pretty lively. I crawl on my
stomach under the brake-beam. They see me and run for me, but I crawl
on hands and knees across the rail on the opposite side and gain my
feet. Then away I go for the head of the train. I run past the engine
and hide in the sheltering darkness. It is the same old situation. I
am ahead of the train, and the train must go past me.

The train pulls out. There is a lantern on the first blind. I lie low,
and see the peering shack go by. But there is also a lantern on the
second blind. That shack spots me and calls to the shack who has gone
past on the first blind. Both jump off. Never mind, I'll take the
third blind and deck her. But heavens, there is a lantern on the third
blind, too. It is the conductor. I let it go by. At any rate I have
now the full train-crew in front of me. I turn and run back in the
opposite direction to what the train is going. I look over my
shoulder. All three lanterns are on the ground and wobbling along in
pursuit. I sprint. Half the train has gone by, and it is going quite
fast, when I spring aboard. I know that the two shacks and the
conductor will arrive like ravening wolves in about two seconds. I
spring upon the wheel of the hand-brake, get my hands on the curved
ends of the roofs, and muscle myself up to the decks; while my
disappointed pursuers, clustering on the platform beneath like dogs
that have treed a cat, howl curses up at me and say unsocial things
about my ancestors.

But what does that matter? It is five to one, including the engineer
and fireman, and the majesty of the law and the might of a great
corporation are behind them, and I am beating them out. I am too far
down the train, and I run ahead over the roofs of the coaches until I
am over the fifth or sixth platform from the engine. I peer down
cautiously. A shack is on that platform. That he has caught sight of
me, I know from the way he makes a swift sneak inside the car; and I
know, also, that he is waiting inside the door, all ready to pounce
out on me when I climb down. But I make believe that I don't know, and
I remain there to encourage him in his error. I do not see him, yet I
know that he opens the door once and peeps up to assure himself that I
am still there.

The train slows down for a station. I dangle my legs down in a
tentative way. The train stops. My legs are still dangling. I hear the
door unlatch softly. He is all ready for me. Suddenly I spring up and
run forward over the roof. This is right over his head, where he lurks
inside the door. The train is standing still; the night is quiet, and
I take care to make plenty of noise on the metal roof with my feet. I
don't know, but my assumption is that he is now running forward to
catch me as I descend at the next platform. But I don't descend there.
Halfway along the roof of the coach, I turn, retrace my way softly and
quickly to the platform both the shack and I have just abandoned. The
coast is clear. I descend to the ground on the off-side of the train
and hide in the darkness. Not a soul has seen me.

I go over to the fence, at the edge of the right of way, and watch.
Ah, ha! What's that? I see a lantern on top of the train, moving along
from front to rear. They think I haven't come down, and they are
searching the roofs for me. And better than that--on the ground on
each side of the train, moving abreast with the lantern on top, are
two other lanterns. It is a rabbit-drive, and I am the rabbit. When
the shack on top flushes me, the ones on each side will nab me. I roll
a cigarette and watch the procession go by. Once past me, I am safe to
proceed to the front of the train. She pulls out, and I make the front
blind without opposition. But before she is fully under way and just
as I am lighting my cigarette, I am aware that the fireman has climbed
over the coal to the back of the tender and is looking down at me. I
am filled with apprehension. From his position he can mash me to a
jelly with lumps of coal. Instead of which he addresses me, and I note
with relief the admiration in his voice.

""You son-of-a-gun,"" is what he says.

It is a high compliment, and I thrill as a schoolboy thrills on
receiving a reward of merit.

""Say,"" I call up to him, ""don't you play the hose on me any more.""

""All right,"" he answers, and goes back to his work.

I have made friends with the engine, but the shacks are still looking
for me. At the next stop, the shacks ride out all three blinds, and as
before, I let them go by and deck in the middle of the train. The
crew is on its mettle by now, and the train stops. The shacks are
going to ditch me or know the reason why. Three times the mighty
overland stops for me at that station, and each time I elude the
shacks and make the decks. But it is hopeless, for they have finally
come to an understanding of the situation. I have taught them that
they cannot guard the train from me. They must do something else.

And they do it. When the train stops that last time, they take after
me hot-footed. Ah, I see their game. They are trying to run me down.
At first they herd me back toward the rear of the train. I know my
peril. Once to the rear of the train, it will pull out with me left
behind. I double, and twist, and turn, dodge through my pursuers, and
gain the front of the train. One shack still hangs on after me. All
right, I'll give him the run of his life, for my wind is good. I run
straight ahead along the track. It doesn't matter. If he chases me ten
miles, he'll nevertheless have to catch the train, and I can board her
at any speed that he can.

So I run on, keeping just comfortably ahead of him and straining my
eyes in the gloom for cattle-guards and switches that may bring me to
grief. Alas! I strain my eyes too far ahead, and trip over something
just under my feet, I know not what, some little thing, and go down to
earth in a long, stumbling fall. The next moment I am on my feet, but
the shack has me by the collar. I do not struggle. I am busy with
breathing deeply and with sizing him up. He is narrow-shouldered, and
I have at least thirty pounds the better of him in weight. Besides, he
is just as tired as I am, and if he tries to slug me, I'll teach him a
few things.

But he doesn't try to slug me, and that problem is settled. Instead,
he starts to lead me back toward the train, and another possible
problem arises. I see the lanterns of the conductor and the other
shack. We are approaching them. Not for nothing have I made the
acquaintance of the New York police. Not for nothing, in box-cars, by
water-tanks, and in prison-cells, have I listened to bloody tales of
man-handling. What if these three men are about to man-handle me?
Heaven knows I have given them provocation enough. I think quickly. We
are drawing nearer and nearer to the other two trainmen. I line up the
stomach and the jaw of my captor, and plan the right and left I'll
give him at the first sign of trouble.

Pshaw! I know another trick I'd like to work on him, and I almost
regret that I did not do it at the moment I was captured. I could make
him sick, what of his clutch on my collar. His fingers,
tight-gripping, are buried inside my collar. My coat is tightly
buttoned. Did you ever see a tourniquet? Well, this is one. All I have
to do is to duck my head under his arm and begin to twist. I must
twist rapidly--very rapidly. I know how to do it; twisting in a
violent, jerky way, ducking my head under his arm with each
revolution. Before he knows it, those detaining fingers of his will be
detained. He will be unable to withdraw them. It is a powerful
leverage. Twenty seconds after I have started revolving, the blood
will be bursting out of his finger-ends, the delicate tendons will be
rupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing
together in a shrieking mass. Try it sometime when somebody has you by
the collar. But be quick--quick as lightning. Also, be sure to hug
yourself while you are revolving--hug your face with your left arm and
your abdomen with your right. You see, the other fellow might try to
stop you with a punch from his free arm. It would be a good idea, too,
to revolve away from that free arm rather than toward it. A punch
going is never so bad as a punch coming.

That shack will never know how near he was to being made very, very
sick. All that saves him is that it is not in their plan to man-handle
me. When we draw near enough, he calls out that he has me, and they
signal the train to come on. The engine passes us, and the three
blinds. After that, the conductor and the other shack swing aboard.
But still my captor holds on to me. I see the plan. He is going to
hold me until the rear of the train goes by. Then he will hop on, and
I shall be left behind--ditched.

But the train has pulled out fast, the engineer trying to make up for
lost time. Also, it is a long train. It is going very lively, and I
know the shack is measuring its speed with apprehension.

""Think you can make it?"" I query innocently.

He releases my collar, makes a quick run, and swings aboard. A number
of coaches are yet to pass by. He knows it, and remains on the steps,
his head poked out and watching me. In that moment my next move comes
to me. I'll make the last platform. I know she's going fast and
faster, but I'll only get a roll in the dirt if I fail, and the
optimism of youth is mine. I do not give myself away. I stand with a
dejected droop of shoulder, advertising that I have abandoned hope.
But at the same time I am feeling with my feet the good gravel. It is
perfect footing. Also I am watching the poked-out head of the shack. I
see it withdrawn. He is confident that the train is going too fast for
me ever to make it.

And the train _is_ going fast--faster than any train I have ever
tackled. As the last coach comes by I sprint in the same direction
with it. It is a swift, short sprint. I cannot hope to equal the speed
of the train, but I can reduce the difference of our speed to the
minimum, and, hence, reduce the shock of impact, when I leap on board.
In the fleeting instant of darkness I do not see the iron hand-rail of
the last platform; nor is there time for me to locate it. I reach for
where I think it ought to be, and at the same instant my feet leave
the ground. It is all in the toss. The next moment I may be rolling in
the gravel with broken ribs, or arms, or head. But my fingers grip the
hand-hold, there is a jerk on my arms that slightly pivots my body,
and my feet land on the steps with sharp violence.

I sit down, feeling very proud of myself. In all my hoboing it is the
best bit of train-jumping I have done. I know that late at night one
is always good for several stations on the last platform, but I do not
care to trust myself at the rear of the train. At the first stop I run
forward on the off-side of the train, pass the Pullmans, and duck
under and take a rod under a day-coach. At the next stop I run forward
again and take another rod.

I am now comparatively safe. The shacks think I am ditched. But the
long day and the strenuous night are beginning to tell on me. Also, it
is not so windy nor cold underneath, and I begin to doze. This will
never do. Sleep on the rods spells death, so I crawl out at a station
and go forward to the second blind. Here I can lie down and sleep; and
here I do sleep--how long I do not know--for I am awakened by a
lantern thrust into my face. The two shacks are staring at me. I
scramble up on the defensive, wondering as to which one is going to
make the first ""pass"" at me. But slugging is far from their minds.

""I thought you was ditched,"" says the shack who had held me by the
collar.

""If you hadn't let go of me when you did, you'd have been ditched
along with me,"" I answer.

""How's that?"" he asks.

""I'd have gone into a clinch with you, that's all,"" is my reply.

They hold a consultation, and their verdict is summed up in:--

""Well, I guess you can ride, Bo. There's no use trying to keep you
off.""

And they go away and leave me in peace to the end of their division.

I have given the foregoing as a sample of what ""holding her down""
means. Of course, I have selected a fortunate night out of my
experiences, and said nothing of the nights--and many of them--when I
was tripped up by accident and ditched.

In conclusion, I want to tell of what happened when I reached the end
of the division. On single-track, transcontinental lines, the freight
trains wait at the divisions and follow out after the passenger
trains. When the division was reached, I left my train, and looked for
the freight that would pull out behind it. I found the freight, made
up on a side-track and waiting. I climbed into a box-car half full of
coal and lay down. In no time I was asleep.

I was awakened by the sliding open of the door. Day was just dawning,
cold and gray, and the freight had not yet started. A ""con""
(conductor) was poking his head inside the door.

""Get out of that, you blankety-blank-blank!"" he roared at me.

I got, and outside I watched him go down the line inspecting every car
in the train. When he got out of sight I thought to myself that he
would never think I'd have the nerve to climb back into the very car
out of which he had fired me. So back I climbed and lay down again.

Now that con's mental processes must have been paralleling mine, for
he reasoned that it was the very thing I would do. For back he came
and fired me out.

Now, surely, I reasoned, he will never dream that I'd do it a third
time. Back I went, into the very same car. But I decided to make sure.
Only one side-door could be opened. The other side-door was nailed up.
Beginning at the top of the coal, I dug a hole alongside of that door
and lay down in it. I heard the other door open. The con climbed up
and looked in over the top of the coal. He couldn't see me. He called
to me to get out. I tried to fool him by remaining quiet. But when he
began tossing chunks of coal into the hole on top of me, I gave up and
for the third time was fired out. Also, he informed me in warm terms
of what would happen to me if he caught me in there again.

I changed my tactics. When a man is paralleling your mental processes,
ditch him. Abruptly break off your line of reasoning, and go off on a
new line. This I did. I hid between some cars on an adjacent
side-track, and watched. Sure enough, that con came back again to the
car. He opened the door, he climbed up, he called, he threw coal into
the hole I had made. He even crawled over the coal and looked into the
hole. That satisfied him. Five minutes later the freight was pulling
out, and he was not in sight. I ran alongside the car, pulled the door
open, and climbed in. He never looked for me again, and I rode that
coal-car precisely one thousand and twenty-two miles, sleeping most of
the time and getting out at divisions (where the freights always stop
for an hour or so) to beg my food. And at the end of the thousand and
twenty-two miles I lost that car through a happy incident. I got a
""set-down,"" and the tramp doesn't live who won't miss a train for a
set-down any time.




PICTURES

    ""What do it matter where or 'ow we die,
    So long as we've our 'ealth to watch it all?""

                  --Sestina of the Tramp-Royal


Perhaps the greatest charm of tramp-life is the absence of monotony.
In Hobo Land the face of life is protean--an ever changing
phantasmagoria, where the impossible happens and the unexpected jumps
out of the bushes at every turn of the road. The hobo never knows what
is going to happen the next moment; hence, he lives only in the
present moment. He has learned the futility of telic endeavor, and
knows the delight of drifting along with the whimsicalities of Chance.

Often I think over my tramp days, and ever I marvel at the swift
succession of pictures that flash up in my memory. It matters not
where I begin to think; any day of all the days is a day apart, with a
record of swift-moving pictures all its own. For instance, I remember
a sunny summer morning in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and immediately
comes to my mind the auspicious beginning of the day--a ""set-down""
with two maiden ladies, and not in their kitchen, but in their dining
room, with them beside me at the table. We ate eggs, out of egg-cups!
It was the first time I had ever seen egg-cups, or heard of egg-cups!
I was a bit awkward at first, I'll confess; but I was hungry and
unabashed. I mastered the egg-cup, and I mastered the eggs in a way
that made those two maiden ladies sit up.

Why, they ate like a couple of canaries, dabbling with the one egg
each they took, and nibbling at tiny wafers of toast. Life was low in
their bodies; their blood ran thin; and they had slept warm all night.
I had been out all night, consuming much fuel of my body to keep warm,
beating my way down from a place called Emporium, in the northern part
of the state. Wafers of toast! Out of sight! But each wafer was no
more than a mouthful to me--nay, no more than a bite. It is tedious to
have to reach for another piece of toast each bite when one is
potential with many bites.

When I was a very little lad, I had a very little dog called Punch. I
saw to his feeding myself. Some one in the household had shot a lot of
ducks, and we had a fine meat dinner. When I had finished, I prepared
Punch's dinner--a large plateful of bones and tidbits. I went outside
to give it to him. Now it happened that a visitor had ridden over from
a neighboring ranch, and with him had come a Newfoundland dog as big
as a calf. I set the plate on the ground. Punch wagged his tail and
began. He had before him a blissful half-hour at least. There was a
sudden rush. Punch was brushed aside like a straw in the path of a
cyclone, and that Newfoundland swooped down upon the plate. In spite
of his huge maw he must have been trained to quick lunches, for, in
the fleeting instant before he received the kick in the ribs I aimed
at him, he completely engulfed the contents of the plate. He swept it
clean. One last lingering lick of his tongue removed even the grease
stains.

As that big Newfoundland behaved at the plate of my dog Punch, so
behaved I at the table of those two maiden ladies of Harrisburg. I
swept it bare. I didn't break anything, but I cleaned out the eggs and
the toast and the coffee. The servant brought more, but I kept her
busy, and ever she brought more and more. The coffee was delicious,
but it needn't have been served in such tiny cups. What time had I to
eat when it took all my time to prepare the many cups of coffee for
drinking?

At any rate, it gave my tongue time to wag. Those two maiden ladies,
with their pink-and-white complexions and gray curls, had never looked
upon the bright face of adventure. As the ""Tramp-Royal"" would have it,
they had worked all their lives ""on one same shift."" Into the sweet
scents and narrow confines of their uneventful existence I brought the
large airs of the world, freighted with the lusty smells of sweat and
strife, and with the tangs and odors of strange lands and soils. And
right well I scratched their soft palms with the callous on my own
palms--the half-inch horn that comes of pull-and-haul of rope and long
and arduous hours of caressing shovel-handles. This I did, not merely
in the braggadocio of youth, but to prove, by toil performed, the
claim I had upon their charity.

Ah, I can see them now, those dear, sweet ladies, just as I sat at
their breakfast table twelve years ago, discoursing upon the way of my
feet in the world, brushing aside their kindly counsel as a real
devilish fellow should, and thrilling them, not alone with my own
adventures, but with the adventures of all the other fellows with whom
I had rubbed shoulders and exchanged confidences. I appropriated them
all, the adventures of the other fellows, I mean; and if those maiden
ladies had been less trustful and guileless, they could have tangled
me up beautifully in my chronology. Well, well, and what of it? It was
fair exchange. For their many cups of coffee, and eggs, and bites of
toast, I gave full value. Right royally I gave them entertainment. My
coming to sit at their table was their adventure, and adventure is
beyond price anyway.

Coming along the street, after parting from the maiden ladies, I
gathered in a newspaper from the doorway of some late-riser, and in a
grassy park lay down to get in touch with the last twenty-four hours
of the world. There, in the park, I met a fellow-hobo who told me his
life-story and who wrestled with me to join the United States Army. He
had given in to the recruiting officer and was just about to join, and
he couldn't see why I shouldn't join with him. He had been a member of
Coxey's Army in the march to Washington several months before, and
that seemed to have given him a taste for army life. I, too, was a
veteran, for had I not been a private in Company L of the Second
Division of Kelly's Industrial Army?--said Company L being commonly
known as the ""Nevada push."" But my army experience had had the
opposite effect on me; so I left that hobo to go his way to the dogs
of war, while I ""threw my feet"" for dinner.

This duty performed, I started to walk across the bridge over the
Susquehanna to the west shore. I forget the name of the railroad that
ran down that side, but while lying in the grass in the morning the
idea had come to me to go to Baltimore; so to Baltimore I was going on
that railroad, whatever its name was. It was a warm afternoon, and
part way across the bridge I came to a lot of fellows who were in
swimming off one of the piers. Off went my clothes and in went I. The
water was fine; but when I came out and dressed, I found I had been
robbed. Some one had gone through my clothes. Now I leave it to you if
being robbed isn't in itself adventure enough for one day. I have
known men who have been robbed and who have talked all the rest of
their lives about it. True, the thief that went through my clothes
didn't get much--some thirty or forty cents in nickels and pennies,
and my tobacco and cigarette papers; but it was all I had, which is
more than most men can be robbed of, for they have something left at
home, while I had no home. It was a pretty tough gang in swimming
there. I sized up, and knew better than to squeal. So I begged ""the
makings,"" and I could have sworn it was one of my own papers I rolled
the tobacco in.

Then on across the bridge I hiked to the west shore. Here ran the
railroad I was after. No station was in sight. How to catch a freight
without walking to a station was the problem. I noticed that the track
came up a steep grade, culminating at the point where I had tapped it,
and I knew that a heavy freight couldn't pull up there any too lively.
But how lively? On the opposite side of the track rose a high bank. On
the edge, at the top, I saw a man's head sticking up from the grass.
Perhaps he knew how fast the freights took the grade, and when the
next one went south. I called out my questions to him, and he motioned
to me to come up.

I obeyed, and when I reached the top, I found four other men lying in
the grass with him. I took in the scene and knew them for what they
were--American gypsies. In the open space that extended back among the
trees from the edge of the bank were several nondescript wagons.
Ragged, half-naked children swarmed over the camp, though I noticed
that they took care not to come near and bother the men-folk. Several
lean, unbeautiful, and toil-degraded women were pottering about with
camp-chores, and one I noticed who sat by herself on the seat of one
of the wagons, her head drooped forward, her knees drawn up to her
chin and clasped limply by her arms. She did not look happy. She
looked as if she did not care for anything--in this I was wrong, for
later I was to learn that there was something for which she did care.
The full measure of human suffering was in her face, and, in
addition, there was the tragic expression of incapacity for further
suffering. Nothing could hurt any more, was what her face seemed to
portray; but in this, too, I was wrong.

I lay in the grass on the edge of the steep and talked with the
men-folk. We were kin--brothers. I was the American hobo, and they
were the American gypsy. I knew enough of their argot for
conversation, and they knew enough of mine. There were two more in
their gang, who were across the river ""mushing"" in Harrisburg. A
""musher"" is an itinerant fakir. This word is not to be confounded with
the Klondike ""musher,"" though the origin of both terms may be the
same; namely, the corruption of the French _marche ons_, to march, to
walk, to ""mush."" The particular graft of the two mushers who had
crossed the river was umbrella-mending; but what real graft lay behind
their umbrella-mending, I was not told, nor would it have been polite
to ask.

It was a glorious day. Not a breath of wind was stirring, and we
basked in the shimmering warmth of the sun. From everywhere arose the
drowsy hum of insects, and the balmy air was filled with scents of the
sweet earth and the green growing things. We were too lazy to do more
than mumble on in intermittent conversation. And then, all abruptly,
the peace and quietude was jarred awry by man.

Two bare-legged boys of eight or nine in some minor way broke some
rule of the camp--what it was I did not know; and a man who lay beside
me suddenly sat up and called to them. He was chief of the tribe, a
man with narrow forehead and narrow-slitted eyes, whose thin lips and
twisted sardonic features explained why the two boys jumped and tensed
like startled deer at the sound of his voice. The alertness of fear
was in their faces, and they turned, in a panic, to run. He called to
them to come back, and one boy lagged behind reluctantly, his meagre
little frame portraying in pantomime the struggle within him between
fear and reason. He wanted to come back. His intelligence and past
experience told him that to come back was a lesser evil than to run
on; but lesser evil that it was, it was great enough to put wings to
his fear and urge his feet to flight.

Still he lagged and struggled until he reached the shelter of the
trees, where he halted. The chief of the tribe did not pursue. He
sauntered over to a wagon and picked up a heavy whip. Then he came
back to the centre of the open space and stood still. He did not
speak. He made no gestures. He was the Law, pitiless and omnipotent.
He merely stood there and waited. And I knew, and all knew, and the
two boys in the shelter of the trees knew, for what he waited.

The boy who had lagged slowly came back. His face was stamped with
quivering resolution. He did not falter. He had made up his mind to
take his punishment. And mark you, the punishment was not for the
original offence, but for the offence of running away. And in this,
that tribal chieftain but behaved as behaves the exalted society in
which he lived. We punish our criminals, and when they escape and run
away, we bring them back and add to their punishment.

Straight up to the chief the boy came, halting at the proper distance
for the swing of the lash. The whip hissed through the air, and I
caught myself with a start of surprise at the weight of the blow. The
thin little leg was so very thin and little. The flesh showed white
where the lash had curled and bitten, and then, where the white had
shown, sprang up the savage welt, with here and there along its length
little scarlet oozings where the skin had broken. Again the whip
swung, and the boy's whole body winced in anticipation of the blow,
though he did not move from the spot. His will held good. A second
welt sprang up, and a third. It was not until the fourth landed that
the boy screamed. Also, he could no longer stand still, and from then
on, blow after blow, he danced up and down in his anguish, screaming;
but he did not attempt to run away. If his involuntary dancing took
him beyond the reach of the whip, he danced back into range again. And
when it was all over--a dozen blows--he went away, whimpering and
squealing, among the wagons.

The chief stood still and waited. The second boy came out from the
trees. But he did not come straight. He came like a cringing dog,
obsessed by little panics that made him turn and dart away for half a
dozen steps. But always he turned and came back, circling nearer and
nearer to the man, whimpering, making inarticulate animal-noises in
his throat. I saw that he never looked at the man. His eyes always
were fixed upon the whip, and in his eyes was a terror that made me
sick--the frantic terror of an inconceivably maltreated child. I have
seen strong men dropping right and left out of battle and squirming in
their death-throes, I have seen them by scores blown into the air by
bursting shells and their bodies torn asunder; believe me, the
witnessing was as merrymaking and laughter and song to me in
comparison with the way the sight of that poor child affected me.

The whipping began. The whipping of the first boy was as play compared
with this one. In no time the blood was running down his thin little
legs. He danced and squirmed and doubled up till it seemed almost that
he was some grotesque marionette operated by strings. I say ""seemed,""
for his screaming gave the lie to the seeming and stamped it with
reality. His shrieks were shrill and piercing; within them no hoarse
notes, but only the thin sexlessness of the voice of a child. The time
came when the boy could stand it no more. Reason fled, and he tried to
run away. But now the man followed up, curbing his flight, herding him
with blows back always into the open space.

Then came interruption. I heard a wild smothered cry. The woman who
sat in the wagon seat had got out and was running to interfere. She
sprang between the man and boy.

""You want some, eh?"" said he with the whip. ""All right, then.""

He swung the whip upon her. Her skirts were long, so he did not try
for her legs. He drove the lash for her face, which she shielded as
best she could with her hands and forearms, drooping her head forward
between her lean shoulders, and on the lean shoulders and arms
receiving the blows. Heroic mother! She knew just what she was doing.
The boy, still shrieking, was making his get-away to the wagons.

And all the while the four men lay beside me and watched and made no
move. Nor did I move, and without shame I say it; though my reason was
compelled to struggle hard against my natural impulse to rise up and
interfere. I knew life. Of what use to the woman, or to me, would be
my being beaten to death by five men there on the bank of the
Susquehanna? I once saw a man hanged, and though my whole soul cried
protest, my mouth cried not. Had it cried, I should most likely have
had my skull crushed by the butt of a revolver, for it was the law
that the man should hang. And here, in this gypsy group, it was the
law that the woman should be whipped.

Even so, the reason in both cases that I did not interfere was not
that it was the law, but that the law was stronger than I. Had it not
been for those four men beside me in the grass, right gladly would I
have waded into the man with the whip. And, barring the accident of
the landing on me with a knife or a club in the hands of some of the
various women of the camp, I am confident that I should have beaten
him into a mess. But the four men _were_ beside me in the grass. They
made their law stronger than I.

Oh, believe me, I did my own suffering. I had seen women beaten
before, often, but never had I seen such a beating as this. Her dress
across the shoulders was cut into shreds. One blow that had passed her
guard, had raised a bloody welt from cheek to chin. Not one blow, nor
two, not one dozen, nor two dozen, but endlessly, infinitely, that
whip-lash smote and curled about her. The sweat poured from me, and I
breathed hard, clutching at the grass with my hands until I strained
it out by the roots. And all the time my reason kept whispering,
""Fool! Fool!"" That welt on the face nearly did for me. I started to
rise to my feet; but the hand of the man next to me went out to my
shoulder and pressed me down.

""Easy, pardner, easy,"" he warned me in a low voice. I looked at him.
His eyes met mine unwaveringly. He was a large man, broad-shouldered
and heavy-muscled; and his face was lazy, phlegmatic, slothful, withal
kindly, yet without passion, and quite soulless--a dim soul,
unmalicious, unmoral, bovine, and stubborn. Just an animal he was,
with no more than a faint flickering of intelligence, a good-natured
brute with the strength and mental caliber of a gorilla. His hand
pressed heavily upon me, and I knew the weight of the muscles behind.
I looked at the other brutes, two of them unperturbed and incurious,
and one of them that gloated over the spectacle; and my reason came
back to me, my muscles relaxed, and I sank down in the grass.

My mind went back to the two maiden ladies with whom I had had
breakfast that morning. Less than two miles, as the crow flies,
separated them from this scene. Here, in the windless day, under a
beneficent sun, was a sister of theirs being beaten by a brother of
mine. Here was a page of life they could never see--and better so,
though for lack of seeing they would never be able to understand their
sisterhood, nor themselves, nor know the clay of which they were made.
For it is not given to woman to live in sweet-scented, narrow rooms
and at the same time be a little sister to all the world.

The whipping was finished, and the woman, no longer screaming, went
back to her seat in the wagon. Nor did the other women come to
her--just then. They were afraid. But they came afterward, when a
decent interval had elapsed. The man put the whip away and rejoined
us, flinging himself down on the other side of me. He was breathing
hard from his exertions. He wiped the sweat from his eyes on his
coat-sleeve, and looked challengingly at me. I returned his look
carelessly; what he had done was no concern of mine. I did not go away
abruptly. I lay there half an hour longer, which, under the
circumstances, was tact and etiquette. I rolled cigarettes from
tobacco I borrowed from them, and when I slipped down the bank to the
railroad, I was equipped with the necessary information for catching
the next freight bound south.

Well, and what of it? It was a page out of life, that's all; and there
are many pages worse, far worse, that I have seen. I have sometimes
held forth (facetiously, so my listeners believed) that the chief
distinguishing trait between man and the other animals is that man is
the only animal that maltreats the females of his kind. It is
something of which no wolf nor cowardly coyote is ever guilty. It is
something that even the dog, degenerated by domestication, will not
do. The dog still retains the wild instinct in this matter, while man
has lost most of his wild instincts--at least, most of the good ones.

Worse pages of life than what I have described? Read the reports on
child labor in the United States,--east, west, north, and south, it
doesn't matter where,--and know that all of us, profit-mongers that we
are, are typesetters and printers of worse pages of life than that
mere page of wife-beating on the Susquehanna.

I went down the grade a hundred yards to where the footing beside the
track was good. Here I could catch my freight as it pulled slowly up
the hill, and here I found half a dozen hoboes waiting for the same
purpose. Several were playing seven-up with an old pack of cards. I
took a hand. A coon began to shuffle the deck. He was fat, and young,
and moon-faced. He beamed with good-nature. It fairly oozed from him.
As he dealt the first card to me, he paused and said:--

""Say, Bo, ain't I done seen you befo'?""

""You sure have,"" I answered. ""An' you didn't have those same duds on,
either.""

He was puzzled.

""D'ye remember Buffalo?"" I queried.

Then he knew me, and with laughter and ejaculation hailed me as a
comrade; for at Buffalo his clothes had been striped while he did his
bit of time in the Erie County Penitentiary. For that matter, my
clothes had been likewise striped, for I had been doing my bit of
time, too.

The game proceeded, and I learned the stake for which we played. Down
the bank toward the river descended a steep and narrow path that led
to a spring some twenty-five feet beneath. We played on the edge of
the bank. The man who was ""stuck"" had to take a small condensed-milk
can, and with it carry water to the winners.

The first game was played and the coon was stuck. He took the small
milk-tin and climbed down the bank, while we sat above and guyed him.
We drank like fish. Four round trips he had to make for me alone, and
the others were equally lavish with their thirst. The path was very
steep, and sometimes the coon slipped when part way up, spilled the
water, and had to go back for more. But he didn't get angry. He
laughed as heartily as any of us; that was why he slipped so often.
Also, he assured us of the prodigious quantities of water he would
drink when some one else got stuck.

When our thirst was quenched, another game was started. Again the coon
was stuck, and again we drank our fill. A third game and a fourth
ended the same way, and each time that moon-faced darky nearly died
with delight at appreciation of the fate that Chance was dealing out
to him. And we nearly died with him, what of our delight. We laughed
like careless children, or gods, there on the edge of the bank. I know
that I laughed till it seemed the top of my head would come off, and
I drank from the milk-tin till I was nigh waterlogged. Serious
discussion arose as to whether we could successfully board the freight
when it pulled up the grade, what of the weight of water secreted on
our persons. This particular phase of the situation just about
finished the coon. He had to break off from water-carrying for at
least five minutes while he lay down and rolled with laughter.

The lengthening shadows stretched farther and farther across the
river, and the soft, cool twilight came on, and ever we drank water,
and ever our ebony cup-bearer brought more and more. Forgotten was the
beaten woman of the hour before. That was a page read and turned over;
I was busy now with this new page, and when the engine whistled on the
grade, this page would be finished and another begun; and so the book
of life goes on, page after page and pages without end--when one is
young.

And then we played a game in which the coon failed to be stuck. The
victim was a lean and dyspeptic-looking hobo, the one who had laughed
least of all of us. We said we didn't want any water--which was the
truth. Not the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind, nor the pressure of a
pneumatic ram, could have forced another drop into my saturated
carcass. The coon looked disappointed, then rose to the occasion and
guessed he'd have some. He meant it, too. He had some, and then some,
and then some. Ever the melancholy hobo climbed down and up the steep
bank, and ever the coon called for more. He drank more water than all
the rest of us put together. The twilight deepened into night, the
stars came out, and he still drank on. I do believe that if the
whistle of the freight hadn't sounded, he'd be there yet, swilling
water and revenge while the melancholy hobo toiled down and up.

But the whistle sounded. The page was done. We sprang to our feet and
strung out alongside the track. There she came, coughing and
spluttering up the grade, the headlight turning night into day and
silhouetting us in sharp relief. The engine passed us, and we were all
running with the train, some boarding on the side-ladders, others
""springing"" the side-doors of empty box-cars and climbing in. I caught
a flat-car loaded with mixed lumber and crawled away into a
comfortable nook. I lay on my back with a newspaper under my head for
a pillow. Above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons
back and forth as the train rounded the curves, and watching them I
fell asleep. The day was done--one day of all my days. To-morrow would
be another day, and I was young.




""PINCHED""


I rode into Niagara Falls in a ""side-door Pullman,"" or, in common
parlance, a box-car. A flat-car, by the way, is known amongst the
fraternity as a ""gondola,"" with the second syllable emphasized and
pronounced long. But to return. I arrived in the afternoon and headed
straight from the freight train to the falls. Once my eyes were filled
with that wonder-vision of down-rushing water, I was lost. I could not
tear myself away long enough to ""batter"" the ""privates"" (domiciles)
for my supper. Even a ""set-down"" could not have lured me away. Night
came on, a beautiful night of moonlight, and I lingered by the falls
until after eleven. Then it was up to me to hunt for a place to ""kip.""

""Kip,"" ""doss,"" ""flop,"" ""pound your ear,"" all mean the same thing;
namely, to sleep. Somehow, I had a ""hunch"" that Niagara Falls was a
""bad"" town for hoboes, and I headed out into the country. I climbed a
fence and ""flopped"" in a field. John Law would never find me there, I
flattered myself. I lay on my back in the grass and slept like a babe.
It was so balmy warm that I woke up not once all night. But with the
first gray daylight my eyes opened, and I remembered the wonderful
falls. I climbed the fence and started down the road to have another
look at them. It was early--not more than five o'clock--and not until
eight o'clock could I begin to batter for my breakfast. I could spend
at least three hours by the river. Alas! I was fated never to see the
river nor the falls again.

The town was asleep when I entered it. As I came along the quiet
street, I saw three men coming toward me along the sidewalk. They were
walking abreast. Hoboes, I decided, like myself, who had got up early.
In this surmise I was not quite correct. I was only sixty-six and
two-thirds per cent correct. The men on each side were hoboes all
right, but the man in the middle wasn't. I directed my steps to the
edge of the sidewalk in order to let the trio go by. But it didn't go
by. At some word from the man in the centre, all three halted, and he
of the centre addressed me.

I piped the lay on the instant. He was a ""fly-cop"" and the two hoboes
were his prisoners. John Law was up and out after the early worm. I
was a worm. Had I been richer by the experiences that were to befall
me in the next several months, I should have turned and run like the
very devil. He might have shot at me, but he'd have had to hit me to
get me. He'd have never run after me, for two hoboes in the hand are
worth more than one on the get-away. But like a dummy I stood still
when he halted me. Our conversation was brief.

""What hotel are you stopping at?"" he queried.

He had me. I wasn't stopping at any hotel, and, since I did not know
the name of a hotel in the place, I could not claim residence in any
of them. Also, I was up too early in the morning. Everything was
against me.

""I just arrived,"" I said.

""Well, you turn around and walk in front of me, and not too far in
front. There's somebody wants to see you.""

I was ""pinched."" I knew who wanted to see me. With that ""fly-cop"" and
the two hoboes at my heels, and under the direction of the former, I
led the way to the city jail. There we were searched and our names
registered. I have forgotten, now, under which name I was registered.
I gave the name of Jack Drake, but when they searched me, they found
letters addressed to Jack London. This caused trouble and required
explanation, all of which has passed from my mind, and to this day I
do not know whether I was pinched as Jack Drake or Jack London. But
one or the other, it should be there to-day in the prison register of
Niagara Falls. Reference can bring it to light. The time was somewhere
in the latter part of June, 1894. It was only a few days after my
arrest that the great railroad strike began.

From the office we were led to the ""Hobo"" and locked in. The ""Hobo"" is
that part of a prison where the minor offenders are confined together
in a large iron cage. Since hoboes constitute the principal division
of the minor offenders, the aforesaid iron cage is called the Hobo.
Here we met several hoboes who had already been pinched that morning,
and every little while the door was unlocked and two or three more
were thrust in on us. At last, when we totalled sixteen, we were led
upstairs into the court-room. And now I shall faithfully describe
what took place in that court-room, for know that my patriotic
American citizenship there received a shock from which it has never
fully recovered.

In the court-room were the sixteen prisoners, the judge, and two
bailiffs. The judge seemed to act as his own clerk. There were no
witnesses. There were no citizens of Niagara Falls present to look on
and see how justice was administered in their community. The judge
glanced at the list of cases before him and called out a name. A hobo
stood up. The judge glanced at a bailiff. ""Vagrancy, your Honor,"" said
the bailiff. ""Thirty days,"" said his Honor. The hobo sat down, and the
judge was calling another name and another hobo was rising to his
feet.

The trial of that hobo had taken just about fifteen seconds. The trial
of the next hobo came off with equal celerity. The bailiff said,
""Vagrancy, your Honor,"" and his Honor said, ""Thirty days."" Thus it
went like clockwork, fifteen seconds to a hobo--and thirty days.

They are poor dumb cattle, I thought to myself. But wait till my turn
comes; I'll give his Honor a ""spiel."" Part way along in the
performance, his Honor, moved by some whim, gave one of us an
opportunity to speak. As chance would have it, this man was not a
genuine hobo. He bore none of the ear-marks of the professional
""stiff."" Had he approached the rest of us, while waiting at a
water-tank for a freight, we should have unhesitatingly classified him as
a ""gay-cat."" Gay-cat is the synonym for tenderfoot in Hobo Land. This
gay-cat was well along in years--somewhere around forty-five, I should
judge. His shoulders were humped a trifle, and his face was seamed by
weather-beat.

For many years, according to his story, he had driven team for some
firm in (if I remember rightly) Lockport, New York. The firm had
ceased to prosper, and finally, in the hard times of 1893, had gone
out of business. He had been kept on to the last, though toward the
last his work had been very irregular. He went on and explained at
length his difficulties in getting work (when so many were out of
work) during the succeeding months. In the end, deciding that he would
find better opportunities for work on the Lakes, he had started for
Buffalo. Of course he was ""broke,"" and there he was. That was all.

""Thirty days,"" said his Honor, and called another hobo's name.

Said hobo got up. ""Vagrancy, your Honor,"" said the bailiff, and his
Honor said, ""Thirty days.""

And so it went, fifteen seconds and thirty days to each hobo. The
machine of justice was grinding smoothly. Most likely, considering how
early it was in the morning, his Honor had not yet had his breakfast
and was in a hurry.

But my American blood was up. Behind me were the many generations of
my American ancestry. One of the kinds of liberty those ancestors of
mine had fought and died for was the right of trial by jury. This was
my heritage, stained sacred by their blood, and it devolved upon me to
stand up for it. All right, I threatened to myself; just wait till he
gets to me.

He got to me. My name, whatever it was, was called, and I stood up.
The bailiff said, ""Vagrancy, your Honor,"" and I began to talk. But the
judge began talking at the same time, and he said, ""Thirty days."" I
started to protest, but at that moment his Honor was calling the name
of the next hobo on the list. His Honor paused long enough to say to
me, ""Shut up!"" The bailiff forced me to sit down. And the next moment
that next hobo had received thirty days and the succeeding hobo was
just in process of getting his.

When we had all been disposed of, thirty days to each stiff, his
Honor, just as he was about to dismiss us, suddenly turned to the
teamster from Lockport--the one man he had allowed to talk.

""Why did you quit your job?"" his Honor asked.

Now the teamster had already explained how his job had quit him, and
the question took him aback.

""Your Honor,"" he began confusedly, ""isn't that a funny question to
ask?""

""Thirty days more for quitting your job,"" said his Honor, and the
court was closed. That was the outcome. The teamster got sixty days
all together, while the rest of us got thirty days.

We were taken down below, locked up, and given breakfast. It was a
pretty good breakfast, as prison breakfasts go, and it was the best I
was to get for a month to come.

As for me, I was dazed. Here was I, under sentence, after a farce of a
trial wherein I was denied not only my right of trial by jury, but my
right to plead guilty or not guilty. Another thing my fathers had
fought for flashed through my brain--habeas corpus. I'd show them. But
when I asked for a lawyer, I was laughed at. Habeas corpus was all
right, but of what good was it to me when I could communicate with no
one outside the jail? But I'd show them. They couldn't keep me in jail
forever. Just wait till I got out, that was all. I'd make them sit up.
I knew something about the law and my own rights, and I'd expose their
maladministration of justice. Visions of damage suits and sensational
newspaper headlines were dancing before my eyes when the jailers came
in and began hustling us out into the main office.

A policeman snapped a handcuff on my right wrist. (Ah, ha, thought I,
a new indignity. Just wait till I get out.) On the left wrist of a
negro he snapped the other handcuff of that pair. He was a very tall
negro, well past six feet--so tall was he that when we stood side by
side his hand lifted mine up a trifle in the manacles. Also, he was
the happiest and the raggedest negro I have ever seen.

We were all handcuffed similarly, in pairs. This accomplished, a
bright nickel-steel chain was brought forth, run down through the
links of all the handcuffs, and locked at front and rear of the
double-line. We were now a chain-gang. The command to march was given,
and out we went upon the street, guarded by two officers. The tall
negro and I had the place of honor. We led the procession.

After the tomb-like gloom of the jail, the outside sunshine was
dazzling. I had never known it to be so sweet as now, a prisoner with
clanking chains, I knew that I was soon to see the last of it for
thirty days. Down through the streets of Niagara Falls we marched to
the railroad station, stared at by curious passers-by, and especially
by a group of tourists on the veranda of a hotel that we marched past.

There was plenty of slack in the chain, and with much rattling and
clanking we sat down, two and two, in the seats of the smoking-car.
Afire with indignation as I was at the outrage that had been
perpetrated on me and my forefathers, I was nevertheless too
prosaically practical to lose my head over it. This was all new to me.
Thirty days of mystery were before me, and I looked about me to find
somebody who knew the ropes. For I had already learned that I was not
bound for a petty jail with a hundred or so prisoners in it, but for a
full-grown penitentiary with a couple of thousand prisoners in it,
doing anywhere from ten days to ten years.

In the seat behind me, attached to the chain by his wrist, was a
squat, heavily-built, powerfully-muscled man. He was somewhere between
thirty-five and forty years of age. I sized him up. In the corners of
his eyes I saw humor and laughter and kindliness. As for the rest of
him, he was a brute-beast, wholly unmoral, and with all the passion
and turgid violence of the brute-beast. What saved him, what made him
possible for me, were those corners of his eyes--the humor and
laughter and kindliness of the beast when unaroused.

He was my ""meat."" I ""cottoned"" to him. While my cuff-mate, the tall
negro, mourned with chucklings and laughter over some laundry he was
sure to lose through his arrest, and while the train rolled on toward
Buffalo, I talked with the man in the seat behind me. He had an empty
pipe. I filled it for him with my precious tobacco--enough in a single
filling to make a dozen cigarettes. Nay, the more we talked the surer
I was that he was my meat, and I divided all my tobacco with him.

Now it happens that I am a fluid sort of an organism, with sufficient
kinship with life to fit myself in 'most anywhere. I laid myself out
to fit in with that man, though little did I dream to what
extraordinary good purpose I was succeeding. He had never been in the
particular penitentiary to which we were going, but he had done
""one-,"" ""two-,"" and ""five-spots"" in various other penitentiaries (a
""spot"" is a year), and he was filled with wisdom. We became pretty
chummy, and my heart bounded when he cautioned me to follow his lead.
He called me ""Jack,"" and I called him ""Jack.""

The train stopped at a station about five miles from Buffalo, and we,
the chain-gang, got off. I do not remember the name of this station,
but I am confident that it is some one of the following: Rocklyn,
Rockwood, Black Rock, Rockcastle, or Newcastle. But whatever the name
of the place, we were walked a short distance and then put on a
street-car. It was an old-fashioned car, with a seat, running the full
length, on each side. All the passengers who sat on one side were
asked to move over to the other side, and we, with a great clanking of
chain, took their places. We sat facing them, I remember, and I
remember, too, the awed expression on the faces of the women, who took
us, undoubtedly, for convicted murderers and bank-robbers. I tried to
look my fiercest, but that cuff-mate of mine, the too happy negro,
insisted on rolling his eyes, laughing, and reiterating, ""O Lawdy!
Lawdy!""

We left the car, walked some more, and were led into the office of the
Erie County Penitentiary. Here we were to register, and on that
register one or the other of my names will be found. Also, we were
informed that we must leave in the office all our valuables: money,
tobacco, matches, pocketknives, and so forth.

My new pal shook his head at me.

""If you do not leave your things here, they will be confiscated
inside,"" warned the official.

Still my pal shook his head. He was busy with his hands, hiding his
movements behind the other fellows. (Our handcuffs had been removed.)
I watched him, and followed suit, wrapping up in a bundle in my
handkerchief all the things I wanted to take in. These bundles the two
of us thrust into our shirts. I noticed that our fellow-prisoners,
with the exception of one or two who had watches, did not turn over
their belongings to the man in the office. They were determined to
smuggle them in somehow, trusting to luck; but they were not so wise
as my pal, for they did not wrap their things in bundles.

Our erstwhile guardians gathered up the handcuffs and chain and
departed for Niagara Falls, while we, under new guardians, were led
away into the prison. While we were in the office, our number had been
added to by other squads of newly arrived prisoners, so that we were
now a procession forty or fifty strong.

Know, ye unimprisoned, that traffic is as restricted inside a large
prison as commerce was in the Middle Ages. Once inside a penitentiary,
one cannot move about at will. Every few steps are encountered great
steel doors or gates which are always kept locked. We were bound for
the barber-shop, but we encountered delays in the unlocking of doors
for us. We were thus delayed in the first ""hall"" we entered. A ""hall""
is not a corridor. Imagine an oblong cube, built out of bricks and
rising six stories high, each story a row of cells, say fifty cells in
a row--in short, imagine a cube of colossal honeycomb. Place this cube
on the ground and enclose it in a building with a roof overhead and
walls all around. Such a cube and encompassing building constitute a
""hall"" in the Erie County Penitentiary. Also, to complete the picture,
see a narrow gallery, with steel railing, running the full length of
each tier of cells and at the ends of the oblong cube see all these
galleries, from both sides, connected by a fire-escape system of
narrow steel stairways.

We were halted in the first hall, waiting for some guard to unlock a
door. Here and there, moving about, were convicts, with close-cropped
heads and shaven faces, and garbed in prison stripes. One such convict
I noticed above us on the gallery of the third tier of cells. He was
standing on the gallery and leaning forward, his arms resting on the
railing, himself apparently oblivious of our presence. He seemed
staring into vacancy. My pal made a slight hissing noise. The convict
glanced down. Motioned signals passed between them. Then through the
air soared the handkerchief bundle of my pal. The convict caught it,
and like a flash it was out of sight in his shirt and he was staring
into vacancy. My pal had told me to follow his lead. I watched my
chance when the guard's back was turned, and my bundle followed the
other one into the shirt of the convict.

A minute later the door was unlocked, and we filed into the
barber-shop. Here were more men in convict stripes. They were the
prison barbers. Also, there were bath-tubs, hot water, soap, and
scrubbing-brushes. We were ordered to strip and bathe, each man to
scrub his neighbor's back--a needless precaution, this compulsory
bath, for the prison swarmed with vermin. After the bath, we were each
given a canvas clothes-bag.

""Put all your clothes in the bags,"" said the guard. ""It's no good
trying to smuggle anything in. You've got to line up naked for
inspection. Men for thirty days or less keep their shoes and
suspenders. Men for more than thirty days keep nothing.""

This announcement was received with consternation. How could naked men
smuggle anything past an inspection? Only my pal and I were safe. But
it was right here that the convict barbers got in their work. They
passed among the poor newcomers, kindly volunteering to take charge of
their precious little belongings, and promising to return them later
in the day. Those barbers were philanthropists--to hear them talk. As
in the case of Fra Lippo Lippi, never was there such prompt
disemburdening. Matches, tobacco, rice-paper, pipes, knives, money,
everything, flowed into the capacious shirts of the barbers. They
fairly bulged with the spoil, and the guards made believe not to see.
To cut the story short, nothing was ever returned. The barbers never
had any intention of returning what they had taken. They considered it
legitimately theirs. It was the barber-shop graft. There were many
grafts in that prison, as I was to learn; and I, too, was destined to
become a grafter--thanks to my new pal.

There were several chairs, and the barbers worked rapidly. The
quickest shaves and hair-cuts I have ever seen were given in that
shop. The men lathered themselves, and the barbers shaved them at the
rate of a minute to a man. A hair-cut took a trifle longer. In three
minutes the down of eighteen was scraped from my face, and my head was
as smooth as a billiard-ball just sprouting a crop of bristles.
Beards, mustaches, like our clothes and everything, came off. Take my
word for it, we were a villainous-looking gang when they got through
with us. I had not realized before how really altogether bad we were.

Then came the line-up, forty or fifty of us, naked as Kipling's heroes
who stormed Lungtungpen. To search us was easy. There were only our
shoes and ourselves. Two or three rash spirits, who had doubted the
barbers, had the goods found on them--which goods, namely, tobacco,
pipes, matches, and small change, were quickly confiscated. This over,
our new clothes were brought to us--stout prison shirts, and coats and
trousers conspicuously striped. I had always lingered under the
impression that the convict stripes were put on a man only after he
had been convicted of a felony. I lingered no longer, but put on the
insignia of shame and got my first taste of marching the lock-step.

In single file, close together, each man's hands on the shoulders of
the man in front, we marched on into another large hall. Here we were
ranged up against the wall in a long line and ordered to strip our
left arms. A youth, a medical student who was getting in his practice
on cattle such as we, came down the line. He vaccinated just about
four times as rapidly as the barbers shaved. With a final caution to
avoid rubbing our arms against anything, and to let the blood dry so
as to form the scab, we were led away to our cells. Here my pal and I
parted, but not before he had time to whisper to me, ""Suck it out.""

As soon as I was locked in, I sucked my arm clean. And afterward I saw
men who had not sucked and who had horrible holes in their arms into
which I could have thrust my fist. It was their own fault. They could
have sucked.

In my cell was another man. We were to be cell-mates. He was a young,
manly fellow, not talkative, but very capable, indeed as splendid a
fellow as one could meet with in a day's ride, and this in spite of
the fact that he had just recently finished a two-year term in some
Ohio penitentiary.

Hardly had we been in our cell half an hour, when a convict sauntered
down the gallery and looked in. It was my pal. He had the freedom of
the hall, he explained. He was unlocked at six in the morning and not
locked up again till nine at night. He was in with the ""push"" in that
hall, and had been promptly appointed a trusty of the kind technically
known as ""hall-man."" The man who had appointed him was also a prisoner
and a trusty, and was known as ""First Hall-man."" There were thirteen
hall-men in that hall. Ten of them had charge each of a gallery of
cells, and over them were the First, Second, and Third Hall-men.

We newcomers were to stay in our cells for the rest of the day, my pal
informed me, so that the vaccine would have a chance to take. Then
next morning we would be put to hard labor in the prison-yard.

""But I'll get you out of the work as soon as I can,"" he promised.
""I'll get one of the hall-men fired and have you put in his place.""

He put his hand into his shirt, drew out the handkerchief containing
my precious belongings, passed it in to me through the bars, and went
on down the gallery.

I opened the bundle. Everything was there. Not even a match was
missing. I shared the makings of a cigarette with my cell-mate. When I
started to strike a match for a light, he stopped me. A flimsy, dirty
comforter lay in each of our bunks for bedding. He tore off a narrow
strip of the thin cloth and rolled it tightly and telescopically into
a long and slender cylinder. This he lighted with a precious match.
The cylinder of tight-rolled cotton cloth did not flame. On the end a
coal of fire slowly smouldered. It would last for hours, and my
cell-mate called it a ""punk."" And when it burned short, all that was
necessary was to make a new punk, put the end of it against the old,
blow on them, and so transfer the glowing coal. Why, we could have
given Prometheus pointers on the conserving of fire.

At twelve o'clock dinner was served. At the bottom of our cage door
was a small opening like the entrance of a runway in a chicken-yard.
Through this were thrust two hunks of dry bread and two pannikins of
""soup."" A portion of soup consisted of about a quart of hot water with
floating on its surface a lonely drop of grease. Also, there was some
salt in that water.

We drank the soup, but we did not eat the bread. Not that we were not
hungry, and not that the bread was uneatable. It was fairly good
bread. But we had reasons. My cell-mate had discovered that our cell
was alive with bed-bugs. In all the cracks and interstices between the
bricks where the mortar had fallen out flourished great colonies. The
natives even ventured out in the broad daylight and swarmed over the
walls and ceiling by hundreds. My cell-mate was wise in the ways of
the beasts. Like Childe Roland, dauntless the slug-horn to his lips he
bore. Never was there such a battle. It lasted for hours. It was
shambles. And when the last survivors fled to their brick-and-mortar
fastnesses, our work was only half done. We chewed mouthfuls of our
bread until it was reduced to the consistency of putty. When a fleeing
belligerent escaped into a crevice between the bricks, we promptly
walled him in with a daub of the chewed bread. We toiled on until the
light grew dim and until every hole, nook, and cranny was closed. I
shudder to think of the tragedies of starvation and cannibalism that
must have ensued behind those bread-plastered ramparts.

We threw ourselves on our bunks, tired out and hungry, to wait for
supper. It was a good day's work well done. In the weeks to come we at
least should not suffer from the hosts of vermin. We had foregone our
dinner, saved our hides at the expense of our stomachs; but we were
content. Alas for the futility of human effort! Scarcely was our long
task completed when a guard unlocked our door. A redistribution of
prisoners was being made, and we were taken to another cell and locked
in two galleries higher up.

Early next morning our cells were unlocked, and down in the hall the
several hundred prisoners of us formed the lock-step and marched out
into the prison-yard to go to work. The Erie Canal runs right by the
back yard of the Erie County Penitentiary. Our task was to unload
canal-boats, carrying huge stay-bolts on our shoulders, like railroad
ties, into the prison. As I worked I sized up the situation and
studied the chances for a get-away. There wasn't the ghost of a show.
Along the tops of the walls marched guards armed with repeating
rifles, and I was told, furthermore, that there were machine-guns in
the sentry-towers.

I did not worry. Thirty days were not so long. I'd stay those thirty
days, and add to the store of material I intended to use, when I got
out, against the harpies of justice. I'd show what an American boy
could do when his rights and privileges had been trampled on the way
mine had. I had been denied my right of trial by jury; I had been
denied my right to plead guilty or not guilty; I had been denied a
trial even (for I couldn't consider that what I had received at
Niagara Falls was a trial); I had not been allowed to communicate with
a lawyer nor any one, and hence had been denied my right of suing for
a writ of habeas corpus; my face had been shaved, my hair cropped
close, convict stripes had been put upon my body; I was forced to toil
hard on a diet of bread and water and to march the shameful lock-step
with armed guards over me--and all for what? What had I done? What
crime had I committed against the good citizens of Niagara Falls that
all this vengeance should be wreaked upon me? I had not even violated
their ""sleeping-out"" ordinance. I had slept outside their
jurisdiction, in the country, that night. I had not even begged for a
meal, or battered for a ""light piece"" on their streets. All that I had
done was to walk along their sidewalk and gaze at their picayune
waterfall. And what crime was there in that? Technically I was guilty
of no misdemeanor. All right, I'd show them when I got out.

The next day I talked with a guard. I wanted to send for a lawyer. The
guard laughed at me. So did the other guards. I really was
_incommunicado_ so far as the outside world was concerned. I tried to
write a letter out, but I learned that all letters were read, and
censured or confiscated, by the prison authorities, and that
""short-timers"" were not allowed to write letters anyway. A little
later I tried smuggling letters out by men who were released, but I
learned that they were searched and the letters found and destroyed.
Never mind. It all helped to make it a blacker case when I did get
out.

But as the prison days went by (which I shall describe in the next
chapter), I ""learned a few."" I heard tales of the police, and
police-courts, and lawyers, that were unbelievable and monstrous. Men,
prisoners, told me of personal experiences with the police of great
cities that were awful. And more awful were the hearsay tales they
told me concerning men who had died at the hands of the police and who
therefore could not testify for themselves. Years afterward, in the
report of the Lexow Committee, I was to read tales true and more awful
than those told to me. But in the meantime, during the first days of
my imprisonment, I scoffed at what I heard.

As the days went by, however, I began to grow convinced. I saw with my
own eyes, there in that prison, things unbelievable and monstrous. And
the more convinced I became, the profounder grew the respect in me for
the sleuth-hounds of the law and for the whole institution of criminal
justice.

My indignation ebbed away, and into my being rushed the tides of fear.
I saw at last, clear-eyed, what I was up against. I grew meek and
lowly. Each day I resolved more emphatically to make no rumpus when I
got out. All I asked, when I got out, was a chance to fade away from
the landscape. And that was just what I did do when I was released. I
kept my tongue between my teeth, walked softly, and sneaked for
Pennsylvania, a wiser and a humbler man.




THE PEN


For two days I toiled in the prison-yard. It was heavy work, and, in
spite of the fact that I malingered at every opportunity, I was played
out. This was because of the food. No man could work hard on such
food. Bread and water, that was all that was given us. Once a week we
were supposed to get meat; but this meat did not always go around, and
since all nutriment had first been boiled out of it in the making of
soup, it didn't matter whether one got a taste of it once a week or
not.

Furthermore, there was one vital defect in the bread-and-water diet.
While we got plenty of water, we did not get enough of the bread. A
ration of bread was about the size of one's two fists, and three
rations a day were given to each prisoner. There was one good thing, I
must say, about the water--it was hot. In the morning it was called
""coffee,"" at noon it was dignified as ""soup,"" and at night it
masqueraded as ""tea."" But it was the same old water all the time. The
prisoners called it ""water bewitched."" In the morning it was black
water, the color being due to boiling it with burnt bread-crusts. At
noon it was served minus the color, with salt and a drop of grease
added. At night it was served with a purplish-auburn hue that defied
all speculation; it was darn poor tea, but it was dandy hot water.

We were a hungry lot in the Erie County Pen. Only the ""long-timers""
knew what it was to have enough to eat. The reason for this was that
they would have died after a time on the fare we ""short-timers""
received. I know that the long-timers got more substantial grub,
because there was a whole row of them on the ground floor in our hall,
and when I was a trusty, I used to steal from their grub while serving
them. Man cannot live on bread alone and not enough of it.

My pal delivered the goods. After two days of work in the yard I was
taken out of my cell and made a trusty, a ""hall-man."" At morning and
night we served the bread to the prisoners in their cells; but at
twelve o'clock a different method was used. The convicts marched in
from work in a long line. As they entered the door of our hall, they
broke the lock-step and took their hands down from the shoulders of
their line-mates. Just inside the door were piled trays of bread, and
here also stood the First Hall-man and two ordinary hall-men. I was
one of the two. Our task was to hold the trays of bread as the line of
convicts filed past. As soon as the tray, say, that I was holding was
emptied, the other hall-man took my place with a full tray. And when
his was emptied, I took his place with a full tray. Thus the line
tramped steadily by, each man reaching with his right hand and taking
one ration of bread from the extended tray.

The task of the First Hall-man was different. He used a club. He stood
beside the tray and watched. The hungry wretches could never get over
the delusion that sometime they could manage to get two rations of
bread out of the tray. But in my experience that sometime never came.
The club of the First Hall-man had a way of flashing out--quick as the
stroke of a tiger's claw--to the hand that dared ambitiously. The
First Hall-man was a good judge of distance, and he had smashed so
many hands with that club that he had become infallible. He never
missed, and he usually punished the offending convict by taking his
one ration away from him and sending him to his cell to make his meal
off of hot water.

And at times, while all these men lay hungry in their cells, I have
seen a hundred or so extra rations of bread hidden away in the cells
of the hall-men. It would seem absurd, our retaining this bread. But
it was one of our grafts. We were economic masters inside our hall,
turning the trick in ways quite similar to the economic masters of
civilization. We controlled the food-supply of the population, and,
just like our brother bandits outside, we made the people pay through
the nose for it. We peddled the bread. Once a week, the men who worked
in the yard received a five-cent plug of chewing tobacco. This chewing
tobacco was the coin of the realm. Two or three rations of bread for a
plug was the way we exchanged, and they traded, not because they loved
tobacco less, but because they loved bread more. Oh, I know, it was
like taking candy from a baby, but what would you? We had to live. And
certainly there should be some reward for initiative and enterprise.
Besides, we but patterned ourselves after our betters outside the
walls, who, on a larger scale, and under the respectable disguise of
merchants, bankers, and captains of industry, did precisely what we
were doing. What awful things would have happened to those poor
wretches if it hadn't been for us, I can't imagine. Heaven knows we
put bread into circulation in the Erie County Pen. Ay, and we
encouraged frugality and thrift ... in the poor devils who forewent
their tobacco. And then there was our example. In the breast of every
convict there we implanted the ambition to become even as we and run a
graft. Saviours of society--I guess yes.

Here was a hungry man without any tobacco. Maybe he was a profligate
and had used it all up on himself. Very good; he had a pair of
suspenders. I exchanged half a dozen rations of bread for it--or a
dozen rations if the suspenders were very good. Now I never wore
suspenders, but that didn't matter. Around the corner lodged a
long-timer, doing ten years for manslaughter. He wore suspenders, and
he wanted a pair. I could trade them to him for some of his meat. Meat
was what I wanted. Or perhaps he had a tattered, paper-covered novel.
That was treasure-trove. I could read it and then trade it off to the
bakers for cake, or to the cooks for meat and vegetables, or to the
firemen for decent coffee, or to some one or other for the newspaper
that occasionally filtered in, heaven alone knows how. The cooks,
bakers, and firemen were prisoners like myself, and they lodged in our
hall in the first row of cells over us.

In short, a full-grown system of barter obtained in the Erie County
Pen. There was even money in circulation. This money was sometimes
smuggled in by the short-timers, more frequently came from the
barber-shop graft, where the newcomers were mulcted, but most of all
flowed from the cells of the long-timers--though how they got it I
don't know.

What of his preeminent position, the First Hall-man was reputed to be
quite wealthy. In addition to his miscellaneous grafts, he grafted on
us. We farmed the general wretchedness, and the First Hall-man was
Farmer-General over all of us. We held our particular grafts by his
permission, and we had to pay for that permission. As I say, he was
reputed to be wealthy; but we never saw his money, and he lived in a
cell all to himself in solitary grandeur.

But that money was made in the Pen I had direct evidence, for I was
cell-mate quite a time with the Third Hall-man. He had over sixteen
dollars. He used to count his money every night after nine o'clock,
when we were locked in. Also, he used to tell me each night what he
would do to me if I gave away on him to the other hall-men. You see,
he was afraid of being robbed, and danger threatened him from three
different directions. There were the guards. A couple of them might
jump upon him, give him a good beating for alleged insubordination,
and throw him into the ""solitaire"" (the dungeon); and in the mix-up
that sixteen dollars of his would take wings. Then again, the First
Hall-man could have taken it all away from him by threatening to
dismiss him and fire him back to hard labor in the prison-yard. And
yet again, there were the ten of us who were ordinary hall-men. If we
got an inkling of his wealth, there was a large liability, some quiet
day, of the whole bunch of us getting him into a corner and dragging
him down. Oh, we were wolves, believe me--just like the fellows who do
business in Wall Street.

He had good reason to be afraid of us, and so had I to be afraid of
him. He was a huge, illiterate brute, an ex-Chesapeake-Bay-oyster-pirate,
an ""ex-con"" who had done five years in Sing Sing, and a general
all-around stupidly carnivorous beast. He used to trap sparrows that
flew into our hall through the open bars. When he made a capture, he
hurried away with it into his cell, where I have seen him crunching
bones and spitting out feathers as he bolted it raw. Oh, no, I never
gave away on him to the other hall-men. This is the first time I have
mentioned his sixteen dollars.

But I grafted on him just the same. He was in love with a woman
prisoner who was confined in the ""female department."" He could neither
read nor write, and I used to read her letters to him and write his
replies. And I made him pay for it, too. But they were good letters. I
laid myself out on them, put in my best licks, and furthermore, I won
her for him; though I shrewdly guess that she was in love, not with
him, but with the humble scribe. I repeat, those letters were great.

Another one of our grafts was ""passing the punk."" We were the
celestial messengers, the fire-bringers, in that iron world of bolt
and bar. When the men came in from work at night and were locked in
their cells, they wanted to smoke. Then it was that we restored the
divine spark, running the galleries, from cell to cell, with our
smouldering punks. Those who were wise, or with whom we did business,
had their punks all ready to light. Not every one got divine sparks,
however. The guy who refused to dig up, went sparkless and smokeless
to bed. But what did we care? We had the immortal cinch on him, and if
he got fresh, two or three of us would pitch on him and give him
""what-for.""

You see, this was the working-theory of the hall-men. There were
thirteen of us. We had something like half a thousand prisoners in our
hall. We were supposed to do the work, and to keep order. The latter
was the function of the guards, which they turned over to us. It was
up to us to keep order; if we didn't, we'd be fired back to hard
labor, most probably with a taste of the dungeon thrown in. But so
long as we maintained order, that long could we work our own
particular grafts.

Bear with me a moment and look at the problem. Here were thirteen
beasts of us over half a thousand other beasts. It was a living hell,
that prison, and it was up to us thirteen there to rule. It was
impossible, considering the nature of the beasts, for us to rule by
kindness. We ruled by fear. Of course, behind us, backing us up, were
the guards. In extremity we called upon them for help; but it would
bother them if we called upon them too often, in which event we could
depend upon it that they would get more efficient trusties to take our
places. But we did not call upon them often, except in a quiet sort of
way, when we wanted a cell unlocked in order to get at a refractory
prisoner inside. In such cases all the guard did was to unlock the
door and walk away so as not to be a witness of what happened when
half a dozen hall-men went inside and did a bit of man-handling.

As regards the details of this man-handling I shall say nothing. And
after all, man-handling was merely one of the very minor unprintable
horrors of the Erie County Pen. I say ""unprintable""; and in justice I
must also say ""unthinkable."" They were unthinkable to me until I saw
them, and I was no spring chicken in the ways of the world and the
awful abysses of human degradation. It would take a deep plummet to
reach bottom in the Erie County Pen, and I do but skim lightly and
facetiously the surface of things as I there saw them.

At times, say in the morning when the prisoners came down to wash, the
thirteen of us would be practically alone in the midst of them, and
every last one of them had it in for us. Thirteen against five
hundred, and we ruled by fear. We could not permit the slightest
infraction of rules, the slightest insolence. If we did, we were lost.
Our own rule was to hit a man as soon as he opened his mouth--hit him
hard, hit him with anything. A broom-handle, end-on, in the face, had
a very sobering effect. But that was not all. Such a man must be made
an example of; so the next rule was to wade right in and follow him
up. Of course, one was sure that every hall-man in sight would come on
the run to join in the chastisement; for this also was a rule.
Whenever any hall-man was in trouble with a prisoner, the duty of any
other hall-man who happened to be around was to lend a fist. Never
mind the merits of the case--wade in and hit, and hit with anything;
in short, lay the man out.

I remember a handsome young mulatto of about twenty who got the insane
idea into his head that he should stand for his rights. And he did
have the right of it, too; but that didn't help him any. He lived on
the topmost gallery. Eight hall-men took the conceit out of him in
just about a minute and a half--for that was the length of time
required to travel along his gallery to the end and down five flights
of steel stairs. He travelled the whole distance on every portion of
his anatomy except his feet, and the eight hall-men were not idle. The
mulatto struck the pavement where I was standing watching it all. He
regained his feet and stood upright for a moment. In that moment he
threw his arms wide apart and omitted an awful scream of terror and
pain and heartbreak. At the same instant, as in a transformation
scene, the shreds of his stout prison clothes fell from him, leaving
him wholly naked and streaming blood from every portion of the surface
of his body. Then he collapsed in a heap, unconscious. He had learned
his lesson, and every convict within those walls who heard him scream
had learned a lesson. So had I learned mine. It is not a nice thing to
see a man's heart broken in a minute and a half.

The following will illustrate how we drummed up business in the graft
of passing the punk. A row of newcomers is installed in your cells.
You pass along before the bars with your punk. ""Hey, Bo, give us a
light,"" some one calls to you. Now this is an advertisement that that
particular man has tobacco on him. You pass in the punk and go your
way. A little later you come back and lean up casually against the
bars. ""Say, Bo, can you let us have a little tobacco?"" is what you
say. If he is not wise to the game, the chances are that he solemnly
avers that he hasn't any more tobacco. All very well. You condole with
him and go your way. But you know that his punk will last him only the
rest of that day. Next day you come by, and he says again, ""Hey, Bo,
give us a light."" And you say, ""You haven't any tobacco and you don't
need a light."" And you don't give him any, either. Half an hour after,
or an hour or two or three hours, you will be passing by and the man
will call out to you in mild tones, ""Come here, Bo."" And you come. You
thrust your hand between the bars and have it filled with precious
tobacco. Then you give him a light.

Sometimes, however, a newcomer arrives, upon whom no grafts are to be
worked. The mysterious word is passed along that he is to be treated
decently. Where this word originated I could never learn. The one
thing patent is that the man has a ""pull."" It may be with one of the
superior hall-men; it may be with one of the guards in some other part
of the prison; it may be that good treatment has been purchased from
grafters higher up; but be it as it may, we know that it is up to us
to treat him decently if we want to avoid trouble.

We hall-men were middle-men and common carriers. We arranged trades
between convicts confined in different parts of the prison, and we put
through the exchange. Also, we took our commissions coming and going.
Sometimes the objects traded had to go through the hands of half a
dozen middle-men, each of whom took his whack, or in some way or
another was paid for his service.

Sometimes one was in debt for services, and sometimes one had others
in his debt. Thus, I entered the prison in debt to the convict who
smuggled in my things for me. A week or so afterward, one of the
firemen passed a letter into my hand. It had been given to him by a
barber. The barber had received it from the convict who had smuggled
in my things. Because of my debt to him I was to carry the letter on.
But he had not written the letter. The original sender was a
long-timer in his hall. The letter was for a woman prisoner in the
female department. But whether it was intended for her, or whether
she, in turn, was one of the chain of go-betweens, I did not know. All
that I knew was her description, and that it was up to me to get it
into her hands.

Two days passed, during which time I kept the letter in my possession;
then the opportunity came. The women did the mending of all the
clothes worn by the convicts. A number of our hall-men had to go to
the female department to bring back huge bundles of clothes. I fixed
it with the First Hall-man that I was to go along. Door after door was
unlocked for us as we threaded our way across the prison to the
women's quarters. We entered a large room where the women sat working
at their mending. My eyes were peeled for the woman who had been
described to me. I located her and worked near to her. Two eagle-eyed
matrons were on watch. I held the letter in my palm, and I looked my
intention at the woman. She knew I had something for her; she must
have been expecting it, and had set herself to divining, at the moment
we entered, which of us was the messenger. But one of the matrons
stood within two feet of her. Already the hall-men were picking up the
bundles they were to carry away. The moment was passing. I delayed
with my bundle, making believe that it was not tied securely. Would
that matron ever look away? Or was I to fail? And just then another
woman cut up playfully with one of the hall-men--stuck out her foot
and tripped him, or pinched him, or did something or other. The matron
looked that way and reprimanded the woman sharply. Now I do not know
whether or not this was all planned to distract the matron's
attention, but I did know that it was my opportunity. My particular
woman's hand dropped from her lap down by her side. I stooped to pick
up my bundle. From my stooping position I slipped the letter into her
hand, and received another in exchange. The next moment the bundle
was on my shoulder, the matron's gaze had returned to me because I was
the last hall-man, and I was hastening to catch up with my companions.
The letter I had received from the woman I turned over to the fireman,
and thence it passed through the hands of the barber, of the convict
who had smuggled in my things, and on to the long-timer at the other
end.

Often we conveyed letters, the chain of communication of which was so
complex that we knew neither sender nor sendee. We were but links in
the chain. Somewhere, somehow, a convict would thrust a letter into my
hand with the instruction to pass it on to the next link. All such
acts were favors to be reciprocated later on, when I should be acting
directly with a principal in transmitting letters, and from whom I
should be receiving my pay. The whole prison was covered by a network
of lines of communication. And we who were in control of the system of
communication, naturally, since we were modelled after capitalistic
society, exacted heavy tolls from our customers. It was service for
profit with a vengeance, though we were at times not above giving
service for love.

And all the time I was in the Pen I was making myself solid with my
pal. He had done much for me, and in return he expected me to do as
much for him. When we got out, we were to travel together, and, it
goes without saying, pull off ""jobs"" together. For my pal was a
criminal--oh, not a jewel of the first water, merely a petty criminal
who would steal and rob, commit burglary, and, if cornered, not stop
short of murder. Many a quiet hour we sat and talked together. He had
two or three jobs in view for the immediate future, in which my work
was cut out for me, and in which I joined in planning the details. I
had been with and seen much of criminals, and my pal never dreamed
that I was only fooling him, giving him a string thirty days long. He
thought I was the real goods, liked me because I was not stupid, and
liked me a bit, too, I think, for myself. Of course I had not the
slightest intention of joining him in a life of sordid, petty crime;
but I'd have been an idiot to throw away all the good things his
friendship made possible. When one is on the hot lava of hell, he
cannot pick and choose his path, and so it was with me in the Erie
County Pen. I had to stay in with the ""push,"" or do hard labor on
bread and water; and to stay in with the push I had to make good with
my pal.

Life was not monotonous in the Pen. Every day something was happening:
men were having fits, going crazy, fighting, or the hall-men were
getting drunk. Rover Jack, one of the ordinary hall-men, was our star
""oryide."" He was a true ""profesh,"" a ""blowed-in-the-glass"" stiff, and
as such received all kinds of latitude from the hall-men in authority.
Pittsburg Joe, who was Second Hall-man, used to join Rover Jack in his
jags; and it was a saying of the pair that the Erie County Pen was the
only place where a man could get ""slopped"" and not be arrested. I
never knew, but I was told that bromide of potassium, gained in
devious ways from the dispensary, was the dope they used. But I do
know, whatever their dope was, that they got good and drunk on
occasion.

Our hall was a common stews, filled with the ruck and the filth, the
scum and dregs, of society--hereditary inefficients, degenerates,
wrecks, lunatics, addled intelligences, epileptics, monsters,
weaklings, in short, a very nightmare of humanity. Hence, fits
flourished with us. These fits seemed contagious. When one man began
throwing a fit, others followed his lead. I have seen seven men down
with fits at the same time, making the air hideous with their cries,
while as many more lunatics would be raging and gibbering up and down.
Nothing was ever done for the men with fits except to throw cold water
on them. It was useless to send for the medical student or the doctor.
They were not to be bothered with such trivial and frequent
occurrences.

There was a young Dutch boy, about eighteen years of age, who had fits
most frequently of all. He usually threw one every day. It was for
that reason that we kept him on the ground floor farther down in the
row of cells in which we lodged. After he had had a few fits in the
prison-yard, the guards refused to be bothered with him any more, and
so he remained locked up in his cell all day with a Cockney cell-mate,
to keep him company. Not that the Cockney was of any use. Whenever the
Dutch boy had a fit, the Cockney became paralyzed with terror.

The Dutch boy could not speak a word of English. He was a farmer's
boy, serving ninety days as punishment for having got into a scrap
with some one. He prefaced his fits with howling. He howled like a
wolf. Also, he took his fits standing up, which was very inconvenient
for him, for his fits always culminated in a headlong pitch to the
floor. Whenever I heard the long wolf-howl rising, I used to grab a
broom and run to his cell. Now the trusties were not allowed keys to
the cells, so I could not get in to him. He would stand up in the
middle of his narrow cell, shivering convulsively, his eyes rolled
backward till only the whites were visible, and howling like a lost
soul. Try as I would, I could never get the Cockney to lend him a
hand. While he stood and howled, the Cockney crouched and trembled in
the upper bunk, his terror-stricken gaze fixed on that awful figure,
with eyes rolled back, that howled and howled. It was hard on him,
too, the poor devil of a Cockney. His own reason was not any too
firmly seated, and the wonder is that he did not go mad.

All that I could do was my best with the broom. I would thrust it
through the bars, train it on Dutchy's chest, and wait. As the crisis
approached he would begin swaying back and forth. I followed this
swaying with the broom, for there was no telling when he would take
that dreadful forward pitch. But when he did, I was there with the
broom, catching him and easing him down. Contrive as I would, he never
came down quite gently, and his face was usually bruised by the stone
floor. Once down and writhing in convulsions, I'd throw a bucket of
water over him. I don't know whether cold water was the right thing or
not, but it was the custom in the Erie County Pen. Nothing more than
that was ever done for him. He would lie there, wet, for an hour or
so, and then crawl into his bunk. I knew better than to run to a guard
for assistance. What was a man with a fit, anyway?

In the adjoining cell lived a strange character--a man who was doing
sixty days for eating swill out of Barnum's swill-barrel, or at least
that was the way he put it. He was a badly addled creature, and, at
first, very mild and gentle. The facts of his case were as he had
stated them. He had strayed out to the circus ground, and, being
hungry, had made his way to the barrel that contained the refuse from
the table of the circus people. ""And it was good bread,"" he often
assured me; ""and the meat was out of sight."" A policeman had seen him
and arrested him, and there he was.

Once I passed his cell with a piece of stiff thin wire in my hand. He
asked me for it so earnestly that I passed it through the bars to him.
Promptly, and with no tool but his fingers, he broke it into short
lengths and twisted them into half a dozen very creditable safety
pins. He sharpened the points on the stone floor. Thereafter I did
quite a trade in safety pins. I furnished the raw material and peddled
the finished product, and he did the work. As wages, I paid him extra
rations of bread, and once in a while a chunk of meat or a piece of
soup-bone with some marrow inside.

But his imprisonment told on him, and he grew violent day by day. The
hall-men took delight in teasing him. They filled his weak brain with
stories of a great fortune that had been left him. It was in order to
rob him of it that he had been arrested and sent to jail. Of course,
as he himself knew, there was no law against eating out of a barrel.
Therefore he was wrongly imprisoned. It was a plot to deprive him of
his fortune.

The first I knew of it, I heard the hall-men laughing about the string
they had given him. Next he held a serious conference with me, in
which he told me of his millions and the plot to deprive him of them,
and in which he appointed me his detective. I did my best to let him
down gently, speaking vaguely of a mistake, and that it was another
man with a similar name who was the rightful heir. I left him quite
cooled down; but I couldn't keep the hall-men away from him, and they
continued to string him worse than ever. In the end, after a most
violent scene, he threw me down, revoked my private detectiveship, and
went on strike. My trade in safety pins ceased. He refused to make any
more safety pins, and he peppered me with raw material through the
bars of his cell when I passed by.

I could never make it up with him. The other hall-men told him that I
was a detective in the employ of the conspirators. And in the meantime
the hall-men drove him mad with their stringing. His fictitious wrongs
preyed upon his mind, and at last he became a dangerous and homicidal
lunatic. The guards refused to listen to his tale of stolen millions,
and he accused them of being in the plot. One day he threw a pannikin
of hot tea over one of them, and then his case was investigated. The
warden talked with him a few minutes through the bars of his cell.
Then he was taken away for examination before the doctors. He never
came back, and I often wonder if he is dead, or if he still gibbers
about his millions in some asylum for the insane.

At last came the day of days, my release. It was the day of release
for the Third Hall-man as well, and the short-timer girl I had won for
him was waiting for him outside the wall. They went away blissfully
together. My pal and I went out together, and together we walked down
into Buffalo. Were we not to be together always? We begged together on
the ""main-drag"" that day for pennies, and what we received was spent
for ""shupers"" of beer--I don't know how they are spelled, but they are
pronounced the way I have spelled them, and they cost three cents. I
was watching my chance all the time for a get-away. From some bo on
the drag I managed to learn what time a certain freight pulled out. I
calculated my time accordingly. When the moment came, my pal and I
were in a saloon. Two foaming shupers were before us. I'd have liked
to say good-by. He had been good to me. But I did not dare. I went out
through the rear of the saloon and jumped the fence. It was a swift
sneak, and a few minutes later I was on board a freight and heading
south on the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad.




HOBOES THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT


In the course of my tramping I encountered hundreds of hoboes, whom I
hailed or who hailed me, and with whom I waited at water-tanks,
""boiled-up,"" cooked ""mulligans,"" ""battered"" the ""drag"" or ""privates,""
and beat trains, and who passed and were seen never again. On the
other hand, there were hoboes who passed and repassed with amazing
frequency, and others, still, who passed like ghosts, close at hand,
unseen, and never seen.

It was one of the latter that I chased clear across Canada over three
thousand miles of railroad, and never once did I lay eyes on him. His
""monica"" was Skysail Jack. I first ran into it at Montreal. Carved
with a jack-knife was the skysail-yard of a ship. It was perfectly
executed. Under it was ""Skysail Jack."" Above was ""B.W. 9-15-94."" This
latter conveyed the information that he had passed through Montreal
bound west, on October 15, 1894. He had one day the start of me.
""Sailor Jack"" was my monica at that particular time, and promptly I
carved it alongside of his, along with the date and the information
that I, too, was bound west.

I had misfortune in getting over the next hundred miles, and eight
days later I picked up Skysail Jack's trail three hundred miles west
of Ottawa. There it was, carved on a water-tank, and by the date I saw
that he likewise had met with delay. He was only two days ahead of me.
I was a ""comet"" and ""tramp-royal,"" so was Skysail Jack; and it was up
to my pride and reputation to catch up with him. I ""railroaded"" day
and night, and I passed him; then turn about he passed me. Sometimes
he was a day or so ahead, and sometimes I was. From hoboes, bound
east, I got word of him occasionally, when he happened to be ahead;
and from them I learned that he had become interested in Sailor Jack
and was making inquiries about me.

We'd have made a precious pair, I am sure, if we'd ever got together;
but get together we couldn't. I kept ahead of him clear across
Manitoba, but he led the way across Alberta, and early one bitter gray
morning, at the end of a division just east of Kicking Horse Pass, I
learned that he had been seen the night before between Kicking Horse
Pass and Rogers' Pass. It was rather curious the way the information
came to me. I had been riding all night in a ""side-door Pullman""
(box-car), and nearly dead with cold had crawled out at the division
to beg for food. A freezing fog was drifting past, and I ""hit"" some
firemen I found in the round-house. They fixed me up with the leavings
from their lunch-pails, and in addition I got out of them nearly a
quart of heavenly ""Java"" (coffee). I heated the latter, and, as I sat
down to eat, a freight pulled in from the west. I saw a side-door open
and a road-kid climb out. Through the drifting fog he limped over to
me. He was stiff with cold, his lips blue. I shared my Java and grub
with him, learned about Skysail Jack, and then learned about him.
Behold, he was from my own town, Oakland, California, and he was a
member of the celebrated Boo Gang--a gang with which I had affiliated
at rare intervals. We talked fast and bolted the grub in the half-hour
that followed. Then my freight pulled out, and I was on it, bound west
on the trail of Skysail Jack.

I was delayed between the passes, went two days without food, and
walked eleven miles on the third day before I got any, and yet I
succeeded in passing Skysail Jack along the Fraser River in British
Columbia. I was riding ""passengers"" then and making time; but he must
have been riding passengers, too, and with more luck or skill than I,
for he got into Mission ahead of me.

Now Mission was a junction, forty miles east of Vancouver. From the
junction one could proceed south through Washington and Oregon over
the Northern Pacific. I wondered which way Skysail Jack would go, for
I thought I was ahead of him. As for myself I was still bound west to
Vancouver. I proceeded to the water-tank to leave that information,
and there, freshly carved, with that day's date upon it, was Skysail
Jack's monica. I hurried on into Vancouver. But he was gone. He had
taken ship immediately and was still flying west on his
world-adventure. Truly, Skysail Jack, you were a tramp-royal, and your
mate was the ""wind that tramps the world."" I take off my hat to you.
You were ""blowed-in-the-glass"" all right. A week later I, too, got my
ship, and on board the steamship Umatilla, in the forecastle, was
working my way down the coast to San Francisco. Skysail Jack and
Sailor Jack--gee! if we'd ever got together.

Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do
tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I
met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a
""stiff"" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the
monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he
was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information
lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a
pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were
still going.

""Monicas"" are the nom-de-rails that hoboes assume or accept when
thrust upon them by their fellows. Leary Joe, for instance, was timid,
and was so named by his fellows. No self-respecting hobo would select
Stew Bum for himself. Very few tramps care to remember their pasts
during which they ignobly worked, so monicas based upon trades are
very rare, though I remember having met the following: Moulder
Blackey, Painter Red, Chi Plumber, Boiler-Maker, Sailor Boy, and
Printer Bo. ""Chi"" (pronounced shy), by the way, is the argot for
""Chicago.""

A favorite device of hoboes is to base their monicas on the localities
from which they hail, as: New York Tommy, Pacific Slim, Buffalo
Smithy, Canton Tim, Pittsburg Jack, Syracuse Shine, Troy Mickey, K.L.
Bill, and Connecticut Jimmy. Then there was ""Slim Jim from Vinegar
Hill, who never worked and never will."" A ""shine"" is always a negro,
so called, possibly, from the high lights on his countenance. Texas
Shine or Toledo Shine convey both race and nativity.

Among those that incorporated their race, I recollect the following:
Frisco Sheeny, New York Irish, Michigan French, English Jack, Cockney
Kid, and Milwaukee Dutch. Others seem to take their monicas in part
from the color-schemes stamped upon them at birth, such as: Chi
Whitey, New Jersey Red, Boston Blackey, Seattle Browney, and Yellow
Dick and Yellow Belly--the last a Creole from Mississippi, who, I
suspect, had his monica thrust upon him.

Texas Royal, Happy Joe, Bust Connors, Burley Bo, Tornado Blackey, and
Touch McCall used more imagination in rechristening themselves.
Others, with less fancy, carry the names of their physical
peculiarities, such as: Vancouver Slim, Detroit Shorty, Ohio Fatty,
Long Jack, Big Jim, Little Joe, New York Blink, Chi Nosey, and
Broken-backed Ben.

By themselves come the road-kids, sporting an infinite variety of
monicas. For example, the following, whom here and there I have
encountered: Buck Kid, Blind Kid, Midget Kid, Holy Kid, Bat Kid, Swift
Kid, Cookey Kid, Monkey Kid, Iowa Kid, Corduroy Kid, Orator Kid (who
could tell how it happened), and Lippy Kid (who was insolent, depend
upon it).

On the water-tank at San Marcial, New Mexico, a dozen years ago, was
the following hobo bill of fare:--

  (1) Main-drag fair.
  (2) Bulls not hostile.
  (3) Round-house good for kipping.
  (4) North-bound trains no good.
  (5) Privates no good.
  (6) Restaurants good for cooks only.
  (7) Railroad House good for night-work only.

Number one conveys the information that begging for money on the main
street is fair; number two, that the police will not bother hoboes;
number three, that one can sleep in the round-house. Number four,
however, is ambiguous. The north-bound trains may be no good to beat,
and they may be no good to beg. Number five means that the residences
are not good to beggars, and number six means that only hoboes that
have been cooks can get grub from the restaurants. Number seven
bothers me. I cannot make out whether the Railroad House is a good
place for any hobo to beg at night, or whether it is good only for
hobo-cooks to beg at night, or whether any hobo, cook or non-cook, can
lend a hand at night, helping the cooks of the Railroad House with
their dirty work and getting something to eat in payment.

But to return to the hoboes that pass in the night. I remember one I
met in California. He was a Swede, but he had lived so long in the
United States that one couldn't guess his nationality. He had to tell
it on himself. In fact, he had come to the United States when no more
than a baby. I ran into him first at the mountain town of Truckee.
""Which way, Bo?"" was our greeting, and ""Bound east"" was the answer
each of us gave. Quite a bunch of ""stiffs"" tried to ride out the
overland that night, and I lost the Swede in the shuffle. Also, I lost
the overland.

I arrived in Reno, Nevada, in a box-car that was promptly
side-tracked. It was a Sunday morning, and after I threw my feet for
breakfast, I wandered over to the Piute camp to watch the Indians
gambling. And there stood the Swede, hugely interested. Of course we
got together. He was the only acquaintance I had in that region, and I
was his only acquaintance. We rushed together like a couple of
dissatisfied hermits, and together we spent the day, threw our feet
for dinner, and late in the afternoon tried to ""nail"" the same
freight. But he was ditched, and I rode her out alone, to be ditched
myself in the desert twenty miles beyond.

Of all desolate places, the one at which I was ditched was the limit.
It was called a flag-station, and it consisted of a shanty dumped
inconsequentially into the sand and sagebrush. A chill wind was
blowing, night was coming on, and the solitary telegraph operator who
lived in the shanty was afraid of me. I knew that neither grub nor bed
could I get out of him. It was because of his manifest fear of me that
I did not believe him when he told me that east-bound trains never
stopped there. Besides, hadn't I been thrown off of an east-bound
train right at that very spot not five minutes before? He assured me
that it had stopped under orders, and that a year might go by before
another was stopped under orders. He advised me that it was only a
dozen or fifteen miles on to Wadsworth and that I'd better hike. I
elected to wait, however, and I had the pleasure of seeing two
west-bound freights go by without stopping, and one east-bound
freight. I wondered if the Swede was on the latter. It was up to me to
hit the ties to Wadsworth, and hit them I did, much to the telegraph
operator's relief, for I neglected to burn his shanty and murder him.
Telegraph operators have much to be thankful for. At the end of half a
dozen miles, I had to get off the ties and let the east-bound overland
go by. She was going fast, but I caught sight of a dim form on the
first ""blind"" that looked like the Swede.

That was the last I saw of him for weary days. I hit the high places
across those hundreds of miles of Nevada desert, riding the overlands
at night, for speed, and in the day-time riding in box-cars and
getting my sleep. It was early in the year, and it was cold in those
upland pastures. Snow lay here and there on the level, all the
mountains were shrouded in white, and at night the most miserable wind
imaginable blew off from them. It was not a land in which to linger.
And remember, gentle reader, the hobo goes through such a land,
without shelter, without money, begging his way and sleeping at night
without blankets. This last is something that can be realized only by
experience.

In the early evening I came down to the depot at Ogden. The overland
of the Union Pacific was pulling east, and I was bent on making
connections. Out in the tangle of tracks ahead of the engine I
encountered a figure slouching through the gloom. It was the Swede. We
shook hands like long-lost brothers, and discovered that our hands
were gloved. ""Where'd ye glahm 'em?"" I asked. ""Out of an engine-cab,""
he answered; ""and where did you?"" ""They belonged to a fireman,"" said
I; ""he was careless.""

We caught the blind as the overland pulled out, and mighty cold we
found it. The way led up a narrow gorge between snow-covered
mountains, and we shivered and shook and exchanged confidences about
how we had covered the ground between Reno and Ogden. I had closed my
eyes for only an hour or so the previous night, and the blind was not
comfortable enough to suit me for a snooze. At a stop, I went forward
to the engine. We had on a ""double-header"" (two engines) to take us
over the grade.

The pilot of the head engine, because it ""punched the wind,"" I knew
would be too cold; so I selected the pilot of the second engine, which
was sheltered by the first engine. I stepped on the cowcatcher and
found the pilot occupied. In the darkness I felt out the form of a
young boy. He was sound asleep. By squeezing, there was room for two
on the pilot, and I made the boy budge over and crawled up beside him.
It was a ""good"" night; the ""shacks"" (brakemen) didn't bother us, and
in no time we were asleep. Once in a while hot cinders or heavy jolts
aroused me, when I snuggled closer to the boy and dozed off to the
coughing of the engines and the screeching of the wheels.

The overland made Evanston, Wyoming, and went no farther. A wreck
ahead blocked the line. The dead engineer had been brought in, and his
body attested the peril of the way. A tramp, also, had been killed,
but his body had not been brought in. I talked with the boy. He was
thirteen years old. He had run away from his folks in some place in
Oregon, and was heading east to his grandmother. He had a tale of
cruel treatment in the home he had left that rang true; besides, there
was no need for him to lie to me, a nameless hobo on the track.

And that boy was going some, too. He couldn't cover the ground fast
enough. When the division superintendents decided to send the overland
back over the way it had come, then up on a cross ""jerk"" to the Oregon
Short Line, and back along that road to tap the Union Pacific the
other side of the wreck, that boy climbed upon the pilot and said he
was going to stay with it. This was too much for the Swede and me. It
meant travelling the rest of that frigid night in order to gain no
more than a dozen miles or so. We said we'd wait till the wreck was
cleared away, and in the meantime get a good sleep.

Now it is no snap to strike a strange town, broke, at midnight, in
cold weather, and find a place to sleep. The Swede hadn't a penny. My
total assets consisted of two dimes and a nickel. From some of the
town boys we learned that beer was five cents, and that the saloons
kept open all night. There was our meat. Two glasses of beer would
cost ten cents, there would be a stove and chairs, and we could sleep
it out till morning. We headed for the lights of a saloon, walking
briskly, the snow crunching under our feet, a chill little wind
blowing through us.

Alas, I had misunderstood the town boys. Beer was five cents in one
saloon only in the whole burg, and we didn't strike that saloon. But
the one we entered was all right. A blessed stove was roaring
white-hot; there were cosey, cane-bottomed arm-chairs, and a
none-too-pleasant-looking barkeeper who glared suspiciously at us as
we came in. A man cannot spend continuous days and nights in his
clothes, beating trains, fighting soot and cinders, and sleeping
anywhere, and maintain a good ""front."" Our fronts were decidedly
against us; but what did we care? I had the price in my jeans.

""Two beers,"" said I nonchalantly to the barkeeper, and while he drew
them, the Swede and I leaned against the bar and yearned secretly for
the arm-chairs by the stove.

The barkeeper set the two foaming glasses before us, and with pride I
deposited the ten cents. Now I was dead game. As soon as I learned my
error in the price I'd have dug up another ten cents. Never mind if it
did leave me only a nickel to my name, a stranger in a strange land.
I'd have paid it all right. But that barkeeper never gave me a chance.
As soon as his eyes spotted the dime I had laid down, he seized the
two glasses, one in each hand, and dumped the beer into the sink
behind the bar. At the same time, glaring at us malevolently, he
said:--

""You've got scabs on your nose. You've got scabs on your nose. You've
got scabs on your nose. See!""

I hadn't either, and neither had the Swede. Our noses were all right.
The direct bearing of his words was beyond our comprehension, but the
indirect bearing was clear as print: he didn't like our looks, and
beer was evidently ten cents a glass.

I dug down and laid another dime on the bar, remarking carelessly,
""Oh, I thought this was a five-cent joint.""

""Your money's no good here,"" he answered, shoving the two dimes across
the bar to me.

Sadly I dropped them back into my pocket, sadly we yearned toward the
blessed stove and the arm-chairs, and sadly we went out the door into
the frosty night.

But as we went out the door, the barkeeper, still glaring, called
after us, ""You've got scabs on your nose, see!""

I have seen much of the world since then, journeyed among strange
lands and peoples, opened many books, sat in many lecture-halls; but
to this day, though I have pondered long and deep, I have been unable
to divine the meaning in the cryptic utterance of that barkeeper in
Evanston, Wyoming. Our noses _were_ all right.

We slept that night over the boilers in an electric-lighting plant.
How we discovered that ""kipping"" place I can't remember. We must have
just headed for it, instinctively, as horses head for water or
carrier-pigeons head for the home-cote. But it was a night not
pleasant to remember. A dozen hoboes were ahead of us on top the
boilers, and it was too hot for all of us. To complete our misery, the
engineer would not let us stand around down below. He gave us our
choice of the boilers or the outside snow.

""You said you wanted to sleep, and so, damn you, sleep,"" said he to
me, when, frantic and beaten out by the heat, I came down into the
fire-room.

""Water,"" I gasped, wiping the sweat from my eyes, ""water.""

He pointed out of doors and assured me that down there somewhere in
the blackness I'd find the river. I started for the river, got lost in
the dark, fell into two or three drifts, gave it up, and returned
half-frozen to the top of the boilers. When I had thawed out, I was
thirstier than ever. Around me the hoboes were moaning, groaning,
sobbing, sighing, gasping, panting, rolling and tossing and
floundering heavily in their torment. We were so many lost souls
toasting on a griddle in hell, and the engineer, Satan Incarnate, gave
us the sole alternative of freezing in the outer cold. The Swede sat
up and anathematized passionately the wanderlust in man that sent him
tramping and suffering hardships such as that.

""When I get back to Chicago,"" he perorated, ""I'm going to get a job
and stick to it till hell freezes over. Then I'll go tramping again.""

And, such is the irony of fate, next day, when the wreck ahead was
cleared, the Swede and I pulled out of Evanston in the ice-boxes of an
""orange special,"" a fast freight laden with fruit from sunny
California. Of course, the ice-boxes were empty on account of the cold
weather, but that didn't make them any warmer for us. We entered them
through hatchways in the top of the car; the boxes were constructed of
galvanized iron, and in that biting weather were not pleasant to the
touch. We lay there, shivered and shook, and with chattering teeth
held a council wherein we decided that we'd stay by the ice-boxes day
and night till we got out of the inhospitable plateau region and down
into the Mississippi Valley.

But we must eat, and we decided that at the next division we would
throw our feet for grub and make a rush back to our ice-boxes. We
arrived in the town of Green River late in the afternoon, but too
early for supper. Before meal-time is the worst time for ""battering""
back-doors; but we put on our nerve, swung off the side-ladders as the
freight pulled into the yards, and made a run for the houses. We were
quickly separated; but we had agreed to meet in the ice-boxes. I had
bad luck at first; but in the end, with a couple of ""hand-outs"" poked
into my shirt, I chased for the train. It was pulling out and going
fast. The particular refrigerator-car in which we were to meet had
already gone by, and half a dozen cars down the train from it I swung
on to the side-ladders, went up on top hurriedly, and dropped down
into an ice-box.

But a shack had seen me from the caboose, and at the next stop a few
miles farther on, Rock Springs, the shack stuck his head into my box
and said: ""Hit the grit, you son of a toad! Hit the grit!"" Also he
grabbed me by the heels and dragged me out. I hit the grit all right,
and the orange special and the Swede rolled on without me.

Snow was beginning to fall. A cold night was coming on. After dark I
hunted around in the railroad yards until I found an empty
refrigerator car. In I climbed--not into the ice-boxes, but into the
car itself. I swung the heavy doors shut, and their edges, covered
with strips of rubber, sealed the car air-tight. The walls were thick.
There was no way for the outside cold to get in. But the inside was
just as cold as the outside. How to raise the temperature was the
problem. But trust a ""profesh"" for that. Out of my pockets I dug up
three or four newspapers. These I burned, one at a time, on the floor
of the car. The smoke rose to the top. Not a bit of the heat could
escape, and, comfortable and warm, I passed a beautiful night. I
didn't wake up once.

In the morning it was still snowing. While throwing my feet for
breakfast, I missed an east-bound freight. Later in the day I nailed
two other freights and was ditched from both of them. All afternoon no
east-bound trains went by. The snow was falling thicker than ever, but
at twilight I rode out on the first blind of the overland. As I swung
aboard the blind from one side, somebody swung aboard from the other.
It was the boy who had run away from Oregon.

Now the first blind of a fast train in a driving snow-storm is no
summer picnic. The wind goes right through one, strikes the front of
the car, and comes back again. At the first stop, darkness having come
on, I went forward and interviewed the fireman. I offered to ""shove""
coal to the end of his run, which was Rawlins, and my offer was
accepted. My work was out on the tender, in the snow, breaking the
lumps of coal with a sledge and shovelling it forward to him in the
cab. But as I did not have to work all the time, I could come into the
cab and warm up now and again.

""Say,"" I said to the fireman, at my first breathing spell, ""there's a
little kid back there on the first blind. He's pretty cold.""

The cabs on the Union Pacific engines are quite spacious, and we
fitted the kid into a warm nook in front of the high seat of the
fireman, where the kid promptly fell asleep. We arrived at Rawlins at
midnight. The snow was thicker than ever. Here the engine was to go
into the round-house, being replaced by a fresh engine. As the train
came to a stop, I dropped off the engine steps plump into the arms of
a large man in a large overcoat. He began asking me questions, and I
promptly demanded who he was. Just as promptly he informed me that he
was the sheriff. I drew in my horns and listened and answered.

He began describing the kid who was still asleep in the cab. I did
some quick thinking. Evidently the family was on the trail of the kid,
and the sheriff had received telegraphed instructions from Oregon.
Yes, I had seen the kid. I had met him first in Ogden. The date
tallied with the sheriff's information. But the kid was still behind
somewhere, I explained, for he had been ditched from that very
overland that night when it pulled out of Rock Springs. And all the
time I was praying that the kid wouldn't wake up, come down out of the
cab, and put the ""kibosh"" on me.

The sheriff left me in order to interview the shacks, but before he
left he said:--

""Bo, this town is no place for you. Understand? You ride this train
out, and make no mistake about it. If I catch you after it's gone ...""

I assured him that it was not through desire that I was in his town;
that the only reason I was there was that the train had stopped there;
and that he wouldn't see me for smoke the way I'd get out of his darn
town.

While he went to interview the shacks, I jumped back into the cab. The
kid was awake and rubbing his eyes. I told him the news and advised
him to ride the engine into the round-house. To cut the story short,
the kid made the same overland out, riding the pilot, with
instructions to make an appeal to the fireman at the first stop for
permission to ride in the engine. As for myself, I got ditched. The
new fireman was young and not yet lax enough to break the rules of the
Company against having tramps in the engine; so he turned down my
offer to shove coal. I hope the kid succeeded with him, for all night
on the pilot in that blizzard would have meant death.

Strange to say, I do not at this late day remember a detail of how I
was ditched at Rawlins. I remember watching the train as it was
immediately swallowed up in the snow-storm, and of heading for a
saloon to warm up. Here was light and warmth. Everything was in full
blast and wide open. Faro, roulette, craps, and poker tables were
running, and some mad cow-punchers were making the night merry. I had
just succeeded in fraternizing with them and was downing my first
drink at their expense, when a heavy hand descended on my shoulder. I
looked around and sighed. It was the sheriff.

Without a word he led me out into the snow.

""There's an orange special down there in the yards,"" said he.

""It's a damn cold night,"" said I.

""It pulls out in ten minutes,"" said he.

That was all. There was no discussion. And when that orange special
pulled out, I was in the ice-boxes. I thought my feet would freeze
before morning, and the last twenty miles into Laramie I stood upright
in the hatchway and danced up and down. The snow was too thick for the
shacks to see me, and I didn't care if they did.

My quarter of a dollar bought me a hot breakfast at Laramie, and
immediately afterward I was on board the blind baggage of an overland
that was climbing to the pass through the backbone of the Rockies. One
does not ride blind baggages in the daytime; but in this blizzard at
the top of the Rocky Mountains I doubted if the shacks would have the
heart to put me off. And they didn't. They made a practice of coming
forward at every stop to see if I was frozen yet.

At Ames' Monument, at the summit of the Rockies,--I forget the
altitude,--the shack came forward for the last time.

""Say, Bo,"" he said, ""you see that freight side-tracked over there to
let us go by?""

I saw. It was on the next track, six feet away. A few feet more in
that storm and I could not have seen it.

""Well, the 'after-push' of Kelly's Army is in one of them cars.
They've got two feet of straw under them, and there's so many of them
that they keep the car warm.""

His advice was good, and I followed it, prepared, however, if it was a
""con game"" the shack had given me, to take the blind as the overland
pulled out. But it was straight goods. I found the car--a big
refrigerator car with the leeward door wide open for ventilation. Up I
climbed and in. I stepped on a man's leg, next on some other man's
arm. The light was dim, and all I could make out was arms and legs and
bodies inextricably confused. Never was there such a tangle of
humanity. They were all lying in the straw, and over, and under, and
around one another. Eighty-four husky hoboes take up a lot of room
when they are stretched out. The men I stepped on were resentful.
Their bodies heaved under me like the waves of the sea, and imparted
an involuntary forward movement to me. I could not find any straw to
step upon, so I stepped upon more men. The resentment increased, so
did my forward movement. I lost my footing and sat down with sharp
abruptness. Unfortunately, it was on a man's head. The next moment he
had risen on his hands and knees in wrath, and I was flying through
the air. What goes up must come down, and I came down on another man's
head.

What happened after that is very vague in my memory. It was like going
through a threshing-machine. I was bandied about from one end of the
car to the other. Those eighty-four hoboes winnowed me out till what
little was left of me, by some miracle, found a bit of straw to rest
upon. I was initiated, and into a jolly crowd. All the rest of that
day we rode through the blizzard, and to while the time away it was
decided that each man was to tell a story. It was stipulated that
each story must be a good one, and, furthermore, that it must be a
story no one had ever heard before. The penalty for failure was the
threshing-machine. Nobody failed. And I want to say right here that
never in my life have I sat at so marvellous a story-telling debauch.
Here were eighty-four men from all the world--I made eighty-five; and
each man told a masterpiece. It had to be, for it was either
masterpiece or threshing-machine.

Late in the afternoon we arrived in Cheyenne. The blizzard was at its
height, and though the last meal of all of us had been breakfast, no
man cared to throw his feet for supper. All night we rolled on through
the storm, and next day found us down on the sweet plains of Nebraska
and still rolling. We were out of the storm and the mountains. The
blessed sun was shining over a smiling land, and we had eaten nothing
for twenty-four hours. We found out that the freight would arrive
about noon at a town, if I remember right, that was called Grand
Island.

We took up a collection and sent a telegram to the authorities of that
town. The text of the message was that eighty-five healthy, hungry
hoboes would arrive about noon and that it would be a good idea to
have dinner ready for them. The authorities of Grand Island had two
courses open to them. They could feed us, or they could throw us in
jail. In the latter event they'd have to feed us anyway, and they
decided wisely that one meal would be the cheaper way.

When the freight rolled into Grand Island at noon, we were sitting on
the tops of the cars and dangling our legs in the sunshine. All the
police in the burg were on the reception committee. They marched us in
squads to the various hotels and restaurants, where dinners were
spread for us. We had been thirty-six hours without food, and we
didn't have to be taught what to do. After that we were marched back
to the railroad station. The police had thoughtfully compelled the
freight to wait for us. She pulled out slowly, and the eighty-five of
us, strung out along the track, swarmed up the side-ladders. We
""captured"" the train.

We had no supper that evening--at least the ""push"" didn't, but I did.
Just at supper time, as the freight was pulling out of a small town,
a man climbed into the car where I was playing pedro with three other
stiffs. The man's shirt was bulging suspiciously. In his hand he
carried a battered quart-measure from which arose steam. I smelled
""Java."" I turned my cards over to one of the stiffs who was looking
on, and excused myself. Then, in the other end of the car, pursued by
envious glances, I sat down with the man who had climbed aboard and
shared his ""Java"" and the hand-outs that had bulged his shirt. It was
the Swede.

At about ten o'clock in the evening, we arrived at Omaha.

""Let's shake the push,"" said the Swede to me.

""Sure,"" said I.

As the freight pulled into Omaha, we made ready to do so. But the
people of Omaha were also ready. The Swede and I hung upon the
side-ladders, ready to drop off. But the freight did not stop.
Furthermore, long rows of policemen, their brass buttons and stars
glittering in the electric lights, were lined up on each side of the
track. The Swede and I knew what would happen to us if we ever dropped
off into their arms. We stuck by the side-ladders, and the train
rolled on across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs.

""General"" Kelly, with an army of two thousand hoboes, lay in camp at
Chautauqua Park, several miles away. The after-push we were with was
General Kelly's rear-guard, and, detraining at Council Bluffs, it
started to march to camp. The night had turned cold, and heavy
wind-squalls, accompanied by rain, were chilling and wetting us. Many
police were guarding us and herding us to the camp. The Swede and I
watched our chance and made a successful get-away.

The rain began coming down in torrents, and in the darkness, unable to
see our hands in front of our faces, like a pair of blind men we
fumbled about for shelter. Our instinct served us, for in no time we
stumbled upon a saloon--not a saloon that was open and doing business,
not merely a saloon that was closed for the night, and not even a
saloon with a permanent address, but a saloon propped up on big
timbers, with rollers underneath, that was being moved from somewhere
to somewhere. The doors were locked. A squall of wind and rain drove
down upon us. We did not hesitate. Smash went the door, and in we
went.

I have made some tough camps in my time, ""carried the banner"" in
infernal metropolises, bedded in pools of water, slept in the snow
under two blankets when the spirit thermometer registered seventy-four
degrees below zero (which is a mere trifle of one hundred and six
degrees of frost); but I want to say right here that never did I make
a tougher camp, pass a more miserable night, than that night I passed
with the Swede in the itinerant saloon at Council Bluffs. In the first
place, the building, perched up as it was in the air, had exposed a
multitude of openings in the floor through which the wind whistled. In
the second place, the bar was empty; there was no bottled fire-water
with which we could warm ourselves and forget our misery. We had no
blankets, and in our wet clothes, wet to the skin, we tried to sleep.
I rolled under the bar, and the Swede rolled under the table. The
holes and crevices in the floor made it impossible, and at the end of
half an hour I crawled up on top the bar. A little later the Swede
crawled up on top his table.

And there we shivered and prayed for daylight. I know, for one, that I
shivered until I could shiver no more, till the shivering muscles
exhausted themselves and merely ached horribly. The Swede moaned and
groaned, and every little while, through chattering teeth, he
muttered, ""Never again; never again."" He muttered this phrase
repeatedly, ceaselessly, a thousand times; and when he dozed, he went
on muttering it in his sleep.

At the first gray of dawn we left our house of pain, and outside,
found ourselves in a mist, dense and chill. We stumbled on till we
came to the railroad track. I was going back to Omaha to throw my feet
for breakfast; my companion was going on to Chicago. The moment for
parting had come. Our palsied hands went out to each other. We were
both shivering. When we tried to speak, our teeth chattered us back
into silence. We stood alone, shut off from the world; all that we
could see was a short length of railroad track, both ends of which
were lost in the driving mist. We stared dumbly at each other, our
clasped hands shaking sympathetically. The Swede's face was blue with
the cold, and I know mine must have been.

""Never again what?"" I managed to articulate.

Speech strove for utterance in the Swede's throat; then faint and
distant, in a thin whisper from the very bottom of his frozen soul,
came the words:--

""Never again a hobo.""

He paused, and, as he went on again, his voice gathered strength and
huskiness as it affirmed his will.

""Never again a hobo. I'm going to get a job. You'd better do the same.
Nights like this make rheumatism.""

He wrung my hand.

""Good-by, Bo,"" said he.

""Good-by, Bo,"" said I.

The next we were swallowed up from each other by the mist. It was our
final passing. But here's to you, Mr. Swede, wherever you are. I hope
you got that job.




ROAD-KIDS AND GAY-CATS


Every once in a while, in newspapers, magazines, and biographical
dictionaries, I run upon sketches of my life, wherein, delicately
phrased, I learn that it was in order to study sociology that I became
a tramp. This is very nice and thoughtful of the biographers, but it
is inaccurate. I became a tramp--well, because of the life that was in
me, of the wanderlust in my blood that would not let me rest.
Sociology was merely incidental; it came afterward, in the same manner
that a wet skin follows a ducking. I went on ""The Road"" because I
couldn't keep away from it; because I hadn't the price of the railroad
fare in my jeans; because I was so made that I couldn't work all my
life on ""one same shift""; because--well, just because it was easier to
than not to.

It happened in my own town, in Oakland, when I was sixteen. At that
time I had attained a dizzy reputation in my chosen circle of
adventurers, by whom I was known as the Prince of the Oyster Pirates.
It is true, those immediately outside my circle, such as honest
bay-sailors, longshoremen, yachtsmen, and the legal owners of the
oysters, called me ""tough,"" ""hoodlum,"" ""smoudge,"" ""thief,"" ""robber,""
and various other not nice things--all of which was complimentary and
but served to increase the dizziness of the high place in which I sat.
At that time I had not read ""Paradise Lost,"" and later, when I read
Milton's ""Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,"" I was fully
convinced that great minds run in the same channels.

It was at this time that the fortuitous concatenation of events sent
me upon my first adventure on The Road. It happened that there was
nothing doing in oysters just then; that at Benicia, forty miles away,
I had some blankets I wanted to get; and that at Port Costa, several
miles from Benicia, a stolen boat lay at anchor in charge of the
constable. Now this boat was owned by a friend of mine, by name Dinny
McCrea. It had been stolen and left at Port Costa by Whiskey Bob,
another friend of mine. (Poor Whiskey Bob! Only last winter his body
was picked up on the beach shot full of holes by nobody knows whom.)
I had come down from ""up river"" some time before, and reported to
Dinny McCrea the whereabouts of his boat; and Dinny McCrea had
promptly offered ten dollars to me if I should bring it down to
Oakland to him.

Time was heavy on my hands. I sat on the dock and talked it over with
Nickey the Greek, another idle oyster pirate. ""Let's go,"" said I, and
Nickey was willing. He was ""broke."" I possessed fifty cents and a
small skiff. The former I invested and loaded into the latter in the
form of crackers, canned corned beef, and a ten-cent bottle of French
mustard. (We were keen on French mustard in those days.) Then, late in
the afternoon, we hoisted our small spritsail and started. We sailed
all night, and next morning, on the first of a glorious flood-tide, a
fair wind behind us, we came booming up the Carquinez Straits to Port
Costa. There lay the stolen boat, not twenty-five feet from the wharf.
We ran alongside and doused our little spritsail. I sent Nickey
forward to lift the anchor, while I began casting off the gaskets.

A man ran out on the wharf and hailed us. It was the constable. It
suddenly came to me that I had neglected to get a written
authorization from Dinny McCrea to take possession of his boat. Also,
I knew that constable wanted to charge at least twenty-five dollars in
fees for capturing the boat from Whiskey Bob and subsequently taking
care of it. And my last fifty cents had been blown in for corned beef
and French mustard, and the reward was only ten dollars anyway. I shot
a glance forward to Nickey. He had the anchor up-and-down and was
straining at it. ""Break her out,"" I whispered to him, and turned and
shouted back to the constable. The result was that he and I were
talking at the same time, our spoken thoughts colliding in mid-air and
making gibberish.

The constable grew more imperative, and perforce I had to listen.
Nickey was heaving on the anchor till I thought he'd burst a
blood-vessel. When the constable got done with his threats and
warnings, I asked him who he was. The time he lost in telling me
enabled Nickey to break out the anchor. I was doing some quick
calculating. At the feet of the constable a ladder ran down the dock
to the water, and to the ladder was moored a skiff. The oars were in
it. But it was padlocked. I gambled everything on that padlock. I
felt the breeze on my cheek, saw the surge of the tide, looked at the
remaining gaskets that confined the sail, ran my eyes up the halyards
to the blocks and knew that all was clear, and then threw off all
dissimulation.

""In with her!"" I shouted to Nickey, and sprang to the gaskets, casting
them loose and thanking my stars that Whiskey Bob had tied them in
square-knots instead of ""grannies.""

The constable had slid down the ladder and was fumbling with a key at
the padlock. The anchor came aboard and the last gasket was loosed at
the same instant that the constable freed the skiff and jumped to the
oars.

""Peak-halyards!"" I commanded my crew, at the same time swinging on to
the throat-halyards. Up came the sail on the run. I belayed and ran
aft to the tiller.

""Stretch her!"" I shouted to Nickey at the peak. The constable was just
reaching for our stern. A puff of wind caught us, and we shot away. It
was great. If I'd had a black flag, I know I'd have run it up in
triumph. The constable stood up in the skiff, and paled the glory of
the day with the vividness of his language. Also, he wailed for a gun.
You see, that was another gamble we had taken.

Anyway, we weren't stealing the boat. It wasn't the constable's. We
were merely stealing his fees, which was his particular form of graft.
And we weren't stealing the fees for ourselves, either; we were
stealing them for my friend, Dinny McCrea.

Benicia was made in a few minutes, and a few minutes later my blankets
were aboard. I shifted the boat down to the far end of Steamboat
Wharf, from which point of vantage we could see anybody coming after
us. There was no telling. Maybe the Port Costa constable would
telephone to the Benicia constable. Nickey and I held a council of
war. We lay on deck in the warm sun, the fresh breeze on our cheeks,
the flood-tide rippling and swirling past. It was impossible to start
back to Oakland till afternoon, when the ebb would begin to run. But
we figured that the constable would have an eye out on the Carquinez
Straits when the ebb started, and that nothing remained for us but to
wait for the following ebb, at two o'clock next morning, when we
could slip by Cerberus in the darkness.

So we lay on deck, smoked cigarettes, and were glad that we were
alive. I spat over the side and gauged the speed of the current.

""With this wind, we could run this flood clear to Rio Vista,"" I said.

""And it's fruit-time on the river,"" said Nickey.

""And low water on the river,"" said I. ""It's the best time of the year
to make Sacramento.""

We sat up and looked at each other. The glorious west wind was pouring
over us like wine. We both spat over the side and gauged the current.
Now I contend that it was all the fault of that flood-tide and fair
wind. They appealed to our sailor instinct. If it had not been for
them, the whole chain of events that was to put me upon The Road would
have broken down.

We said no word, but cast off our moorings and hoisted sail. Our
adventures up the Sacramento River are no part of this narrative. We
subsequently made the city of Sacramento and tied up at a wharf. The
water was fine, and we spent most of our time in swimming. On the
sand-bar above the railroad bridge we fell in with a bunch of boys
likewise in swimming. Between swims we lay on the bank and talked.
They talked differently from the fellows I had been used to herding
with. It was a new vernacular. They were road-kids, and with every
word they uttered the lure of The Road laid hold of me more
imperiously.

""When I was down in Alabama,"" one kid would begin; or, another,
""Coming up on the C. & A. from K.C.""; whereat, a third kid, ""On the C.
& A. there ain't no steps to the 'blinds.'"" And I would lie silently
in the sand and listen. ""It was at a little town in Ohio on the Lake
Shore and Michigan Southern,"" a kid would start; and another, ""Ever
ride the Cannonball on the Wabash?""; and yet another, ""Nope, but I've
been on the White Mail out of Chicago."" ""Talk about railroadin'--wait
till you hit the Pennsylvania, four tracks, no water tanks, take water
on the fly, that's goin' some."" ""The Northern Pacific's a bad road
now."" ""Salinas is on the 'hog,' the 'bulls' is 'horstile.'"" ""I got
'pinched' at El Paso, along with Moke Kid."" ""Talkin' of 'poke-outs,'
wait till you hit the French country out of Montreal--not a word of
English--you say, 'Mongee, Madame, mongee, no spika da French,' an'
rub your stomach an' look hungry, an' she gives you a slice of
sow-belly an' a chunk of dry 'punk.'""

And I continued to lie in the sand and listen. These wanderers made my
oyster-piracy look like thirty cents. A new world was calling to me in
every word that was spoken--a world of rods and gunnels, blind
baggages and ""side-door Pullmans,"" ""bulls"" and ""shacks,"" ""floppings""
and ""chewin's,"" ""pinches"" and ""get-aways,"" ""strong arms"" and
""bindle-stiffs,"" ""punks"" and ""profesh."" And it all spelled Adventure.
Very well; I would tackle this new world. I ""lined"" myself up
alongside those road-kids. I was just as strong as any of them, just
as quick, just as nervy, and my brain was just as good.

After the swim, as evening came on, they dressed and went up town. I
went along. The kids began ""battering"" the ""main-stem"" for ""light
pieces,"" or, in other words, begging for money on the main street. I
had never begged in my life, and this was the hardest thing for me to
stomach when I first went on The Road. I had absurd notions about
begging. My philosophy, up to that time, was that it was finer to
steal than to beg; and that robbery was finer still because the risk
and the penalty were proportionately greater. As an oyster pirate I
had already earned convictions at the hands of justice, which, if I
had tried to serve them, would have required a thousand years in
state's prison. To rob was manly; to beg was sordid and despicable.
But I developed in the days to come all right, all right, till I came
to look upon begging as a joyous prank, a game of wits, a
nerve-exerciser.

That first night, however, I couldn't rise to it; and the result was
that when the kids were ready to go to a restaurant and eat, I wasn't.
I was broke. Meeny Kid, I think it was, gave me the price, and we all
ate together. But while I ate, I meditated. The receiver, it was said,
was as bad as the thief; Meeny Kid had done the begging, and I was
profiting by it. I decided that the receiver was a whole lot worse
than the thief, and that it shouldn't happen again. And it didn't. I
turned out next day and threw my feet as well as the next one.

Nickey the Greek's ambition didn't run to The Road. He was not a
success at throwing his feet, and he stowed away one night on a barge
and went down river to San Francisco. I met him, only a week ago, at a
pugilistic carnival. He has progressed. He sat in a place of honor at
the ring-side. He is now a manager of prize-fighters and proud of it.
In fact, in a small way, in local sportdom, he is quite a shining
light.

""No kid is a road-kid until he has gone over 'the hill'""--such was the
law of The Road I heard expounded in Sacramento. All right, I'd go
over the hill and matriculate. ""The hill,"" by the way, was the Sierra
Nevadas. The whole gang was going over the hill on a jaunt, and of
course I'd go along. It was French Kid's first adventure on The Road.
He had just run away from his people in San Francisco. It was up to
him and me to deliver the goods. In passing, I may remark that my old
title of ""Prince"" had vanished. I had received my ""monica."" I was now
""Sailor Kid,"" later to be known as ""'Frisco Kid,"" when I had put the
Rockies between me and my native state.

At 10.20 P.M. the Central Pacific overland pulled out of the depot at
Sacramento for the East--that particular item of time-table is
indelibly engraved on my memory. There were about a dozen in our gang,
and we strung out in the darkness ahead of the train ready to take her
out. All the local road-kids that we knew came down to see us
off--also, to ""ditch"" us if they could. That was their idea of a joke,
and there were only about forty of them to carry it out. Their
ring-leader was a crackerjack road-kid named Bob. Sacramento was his
home town, but he'd hit The Road pretty well everywhere over the whole
country. He took French Kid and me aside and gave us advice something
like this: ""We're goin' to try an' ditch your bunch, see? Youse two
are weak. The rest of the push can take care of itself. So, as soon as
youse two nail a blind, deck her. An' stay on the decks till youse
pass Roseville Junction, at which burg the constables are horstile,
sloughin' in everybody on sight.""

The engine whistled and the overland pulled out. There were three
blinds on her--room for all of us. The dozen of us who were trying to
make her out would have preferred to slip aboard quietly; but our
forty friends crowded on with the most amazing and shameless
publicity and advertisement. Following Bob's advice, I immediately
""decked her,"" that is, climbed up on top of the roof of one of the
mail-cars. There I lay down, my heart jumping a few extra beats, and
listened to the fun. The whole train crew was forward, and the
ditching went on fast and furious. After the train had run half a
mile, it stopped, and the crew came forward again and ditched the
survivors. I, alone, had made the train out.

Back at the depot, about him two or three of the push that had
witnessed the accident, lay French Kid with both legs off. French Kid
had slipped or stumbled--that was all, and the wheels had done the
rest. Such was my initiation to The Road. It was two years afterward
when I next saw French Kid and examined his ""stumps."" This was an act
of courtesy. ""Cripples"" always like to have their stumps examined. One
of the entertaining sights on The Road is to witness the meeting of
two cripples. Their common disability is a fruitful source of
conversation; and they tell how it happened, describe what they know
of the amputation, pass critical judgment on their own and each
other's surgeons, and wind up by withdrawing to one side, taking off
bandages and wrappings, and comparing stumps.

But it was not until several days later, over in Nevada, when the push
caught up with me, that I learned of French Kid's accident. The push
itself arrived in bad condition. It had gone through a train-wreck in
the snow-sheds; Happy Joe was on crutches with two mashed legs, and
the rest were nursing skins and bruises.

In the meantime, I lay on the roof of the mail-car, trying to remember
whether Roseville Junction, against which burg Bob had warned me, was
the first stop or the second stop. To make sure, I delayed descending
to the platform of the blind until after the second stop. And then I
didn't descend. I was new to the game, and I felt safer where I was.
But I never told the push that I held down the decks the whole night,
clear across the Sierras, through snow-sheds and tunnels, and down to
Truckee on the other side, where I arrived at seven in the morning.
Such a thing was disgraceful, and I'd have been a common
laughing-stock. This is the first time I have confessed the truth
about that first ride over the hill. As for the push, it decided that
I was all right, and when I came back over the hill to Sacramento, I
was a full-fledged road-kid.

Yet I had much to learn. Bob was my mentor, and he was all right. I
remember one evening (it was fair-time in Sacramento, and we were
knocking about and having a good time) when I lost my hat in a fight.
There was I bare-headed in the street, and it was Bob to the rescue.
He took me to one side from the push and told me what to do. I was a
bit timid of his advice. I had just come out of jail, where I had been
three days, and I knew that if the police ""pinched"" me again, I'd get
good and ""soaked."" On the other hand, I couldn't show the white
feather. I'd been over the hill, I was running full-fledged with the
push, and it was up to me to deliver the goods. So I accepted Bob's
advice, and he came along with me to see that I did it up brown.

We took our position on K Street, on the corner, I think, of Fifth. It
was early in the evening and the street was crowded. Bob studied the
head-gear of every Chinaman that passed. I used to wonder how the
road-kids all managed to wear ""five-dollar Stetson stiff-rims,"" and
now I knew. They got them, the way I was going to get mine, from the
Chinese. I was nervous--there were so many people about; but Bob was
cool as an iceberg. Several times, when I started forward toward a
Chinaman, all nerved and keyed up, Bob dragged me back. He wanted me
to get a good hat, and one that fitted. Now a hat came by that was the
right size but not new; and, after a dozen impossible hats, along
would come one that was new but not the right size. And when one did
come by that was new and the right size, the rim was too large or not
large enough. My, Bob was finicky. I was so wrought up that I'd have
snatched any kind of a head-covering.

At last came the hat, the one hat in Sacramento for me. I knew it was
a winner as soon as I looked at it. I glanced at Bob. He sent a
sweeping look-about for police, then nodded his head. I lifted the hat
from the Chinaman's head and pulled it down on my own. It was a
perfect fit. Then I started. I heard Bob crying out, and I caught a
glimpse of him blocking the irate Mongolian and tripping him up. I ran
on. I turned up the next corner, and around the next. This street was
not so crowded as K, and I walked along in quietude, catching my
breath and congratulating myself upon my hat and my get-away.

And then, suddenly, around the corner at my back, came the bare-headed
Chinaman. With him were a couple more Chinamen, and at their heels
were half a dozen men and boys. I sprinted to the next corner, crossed
the street, and rounded the following corner. I decided that I had
surely played him out, and I dropped into a walk again. But around the
corner at my heels came that persistent Mongolian. It was the old
story of the hare and the tortoise. He could not run so fast as I, but
he stayed with it, plodding along at a shambling and deceptive trot,
and wasting much good breath in noisy imprecations. He called all
Sacramento to witness the dishonor that had been done him, and a
goodly portion of Sacramento heard and flocked at his heels. And I ran
on like the hare, and ever that persistent Mongolian, with the
increasing rabble, overhauled me. But finally, when a policeman had
joined his following, I let out all my links. I twisted and turned,
and I swear I ran at least twenty blocks on the straight away. And I
never saw that Chinaman again. The hat was a dandy, a brand-new
Stetson, just out of the shop, and it was the envy of the whole push.
Furthermore, it was the symbol that I had delivered the goods. I wore
it for over a year.

Road-kids are nice little chaps--when you get them alone and they are
telling you ""how it happened""; but take my word for it, watch out for
them when they run in pack. Then they are wolves, and like wolves they
are capable of dragging down the strongest man. At such times they are
not cowardly. They will fling themselves upon a man and hold on with
every ounce of strength in their wiry bodies, till he is thrown and
helpless. More than once have I seen them do it, and I know whereof I
speak. Their motive is usually robbery. And watch out for the ""strong
arm."" Every kid in the push I travelled with was expert at it. Even
French Kid mastered it before he lost his legs.

I have strong upon me now a vision of what I once saw in ""The
Willows."" The Willows was a clump of trees in a waste piece of land
near the railway depot and not more than five minutes walk from the
heart of Sacramento. It is night-time and the scene is illumined by
the thin light of stars. I see a husky laborer in the midst of a pack
of road-kids. He is infuriated and cursing them, not a bit afraid,
confident of his own strength. He weighs about one hundred and eighty
pounds, and his muscles are hard; but he doesn't know what he is up
against. The kids are snarling. It is not pretty. They make a rush
from all sides, and he lashes out and whirls. Barber Kid is standing
beside me. As the man whirls, Barber Kid leaps forward and does the
trick. Into the man's back goes his knee; around the man's neck, from
behind, passes his right hand, the bone of the wrist pressing against
the jugular vein. Barber Kid throws his whole weight backward. It is a
powerful leverage. Besides, the man's wind has been shut off. It is
the strong arm.

The man resists, but he is already practically helpless. The road-kids
are upon him from every side, clinging to arms and legs and body, and
like a wolf at the throat of a moose Barber Kid hangs on and drags
backward. Over the man goes, and down under the heap. Barber Kid
changes the position of his own body, but never lets go. While some of
the kids are ""going through"" the victim, others are holding his legs
so that he cannot kick and thresh about. They improve the opportunity
by taking off the man's shoes. As for him, he has given in. He is
beaten. Also, what of the strong arm at his throat, he is short of
wind. He is making ugly choking noises, and the kids hurry. They
really don't want to kill him. All is done. At a word all holds are
released at once, and the kids scatter, one of them lugging the
shoes--he knows where he can get half a dollar for them. The man sits
up and looks about him, dazed and helpless. Even if he wanted to,
barefooted pursuit in the darkness would be hopeless. I linger a
moment and watch him. He is feeling at his throat, making dry, hawking
noises, and jerking his head in a quaint way as though to assure
himself that the neck is not dislocated. Then I slip away to join the
push, and see that man no more--though I shall always see him, sitting
there in the starlight, somewhat dazed, a bit frightened, greatly
dishevelled, and making quaint jerking movements of head and neck.

Drunken men are the especial prey of the road-kids. Robbing a drunken
man they call ""rolling a stiff""; and wherever they are, they are on
the constant lookout for drunks. The drunk is their particular meat,
as the fly is the particular meat of the spider. The rolling of a
stiff is ofttimes an amusing sight, especially when the stiff is
helpless and when interference is unlikely. At the first swoop the
stiff's money and jewellery go. Then the kids sit around their victim
in a sort of pow-wow. A kid generates a fancy for the stiff's necktie.
Off it comes. Another kid is after underclothes. Off they come, and a
knife quickly abbreviates arms and legs. Friendly hoboes may be called
in to take the coat and trousers, which are too large for the kids.
And in the end they depart, leaving beside the stiff the heap of their
discarded rags.

Another vision comes to me. It is a dark night. My push is coming
along the sidewalk in the suburbs. Ahead of us, under an electric
light, a man crosses the street diagonally. There is something
tentative and desultory in his walk. The kids scent the game on the
instant. The man is drunk. He blunders across the opposite sidewalk
and is lost in the darkness as he takes a short-cut through a vacant
lot. No hunting cry is raised, but the pack flings itself forward in
quick pursuit. In the middle of the vacant lot it comes upon him. But
what is this?--snarling and strange forms, small and dim and menacing,
are between the pack and its prey. It is another pack of road-kids,
and in the hostile pause we learn that it is their meat, that they
have been trailing it a dozen blocks and more and that we are butting
in. But it is the world primeval. These wolves are baby wolves. (As a
matter of fact, I don't think one of them was over twelve or thirteen
years of age. I met some of them afterward, and learned that they had
just arrived that day over the hill, and that they hailed from Denver
and Salt Lake City.) Our pack flings forward. The baby wolves squeal
and screech and fight like little demons. All about the drunken man
rages the struggle for the possession of him. Down he goes in the
thick of it, and the combat rages over his body after the fashion of
the Greeks and Trojans over the body and armor of a fallen hero. Amid
cries and tears and wailings the baby wolves are dispossessed, and my
pack rolls the stiff. But always I remember the poor stiff and his
befuddled amazement at the abrupt eruption of battle in the vacant
lot. I see him now, dim in the darkness, titubating in stupid wonder,
good-naturedly essaying the role of peacemaker in that multitudinous
scrap the significance of which he did not understand, and the really
hurt expression on his face when he, unoffending he, was clutched at
by many hands and dragged down in the thick of the press.

""Bindle-stiffs"" are favorite prey of the road-kids. A bindle-stiff is
a working tramp. He takes his name from the roll of blankets he
carries, which is known as a ""bindle."" Because he does work, a
bindle-stiff is expected usually to have some small change about him,
and it is after that small change that the road-kids go. The best
hunting-ground for bindle-stiffs is in the sheds, barns, lumber-yards,
railroad-yards, etc., on the edges of a city, and the time for hunting
is the night, when the bindle-stiff seeks these places to roll up in
his blankets and sleep.

""Gay-cats"" also come to grief at the hands of the road-kid. In more
familiar parlance, gay-cats are short-horns, _chechaquos_, new chums,
or tenderfeet. A gay-cat is a newcomer on The Road who is man-grown,
or, at least, youth-grown. A boy on The Road, on the other hand, no
matter how green he is, is never a gay-cat; he is a road-kid or a
""punk,"" and if he travels with a ""profesh,"" he is known possessively
as a ""prushun."" I was never a prushun, for I did not take kindly to
possession. I was first a road-kid and then a profesh. Because I
started in young, I practically skipped my gay-cat apprenticeship. For
a short period, during the time I was exchanging my 'Frisco Kid monica
for that of Sailor Jack, I labored under the suspicion of being a
gay-cat. But closer acquaintance on the part of those that suspected
me quickly disabused their minds, and in a short time I acquired the
unmistakable airs and ear-marks of the blowed-in-the-glass profesh.
And be it known, here and now, that the profesh are the aristocracy of
The Road. They are the lords and masters, the aggressive men, the
primordial noblemen, the _blond beasts_ so beloved of Nietzsche.

When I came back over the hill from Nevada, I found that some river
pirate had stolen Dinny McCrea's boat. (A funny thing at this day is
that I cannot remember what became of the skiff in which Nickey the
Greek and I sailed from Oakland to Port Costa. I know that the
constable didn't get it, and I know that it didn't go with us up the
Sacramento River, and that is all I do know.) With the loss of Dinny
McCrea's boat, I was pledged to The Road; and when I grew tired of
Sacramento, I said good-by to the push (which, in its friendly way,
tried to ditch me from a freight as I left town) and started on a
_passear_ down the valley of the San Joaquin. The Road had gripped me
and would not let me go; and later, when I had voyaged to sea and done
one thing and another, I returned to The Road to make longer flights,
to be a ""comet"" and a profesh, and to plump into the bath of sociology
that wet me to the skin.




TWO THOUSAND STIFFS


A ""stiff"" is a tramp. It was once my fortune to travel a few weeks
with a ""push"" that numbered two thousand. This was known as ""Kelly's
Army."" Across the wild and woolly West, clear from California, General
Kelly and his heroes had captured trains; but they fell down when they
crossed the Missouri and went up against the effete East. The East
hadn't the slightest intention of giving free transportation to two
thousand hoboes. Kelly's Army lay helplessly for some time at Council
Bluffs. The day I joined it, made desperate by delay, it marched out
to capture a train.

It was quite an imposing sight. General Kelly sat a magnificent black
charger, and with waving banners, to the martial music of fife and
drum corps, company by company, in two divisions, his two thousand
stiffs countermarched before him and hit the wagon-road to the little
burg of Weston, seven miles away. Being the latest recruit, I was in
the last company, of the last regiment, of the Second Division, and,
furthermore, in the last rank of the rear-guard. The army went into
camp at Weston beside the railroad track--beside the tracks, rather,
for two roads went through: the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul, and
the Rock Island.

Our intention was to take the first train out, but the railroad
officials ""coppered"" our play--and won. There was no first train. They
tied up the two lines and stopped running trains. In the meantime,
while we lay by the dead tracks, the good people of Omaha and Council
Bluffs were bestirring themselves. Preparations were making to form a
mob, capture a train in Council Bluffs, run it down to us, and make us
a present of it. The railroad officials coppered that play, too. They
didn't wait for the mob. Early in the morning of the second day, an
engine, with a single private car attached, arrived at the station and
side-tracked. At this sign that life had renewed in the dead roads,
the whole army lined up beside the track.

But never did life renew so monstrously on a dead railroad as it did
on those two roads. From the west came the whistle of a locomotive.
It was coming in our direction, bound east. We were bound east. A stir
of preparation ran down our ranks. The whistle tooted fast and
furiously, and the train thundered at top speed. The hobo didn't live
that could have boarded it. Another locomotive whistled, and another
train came through at top speed, and another, and another, train after
train, train after train, till toward the last the trains were
composed of passenger coaches, box-cars, flat-cars, dead engines,
cabooses, mail-cars, wrecking appliances, and all the riff-raff of
worn-out and abandoned rolling-stock that collects in the yards of
great railways. When the yards at Council Bluffs had been completely
cleaned, the private car and engine went east, and the tracks died for
keeps.

That day went by, and the next, and nothing moved, and in the
meantime, pelted by sleet, and rain, and hail, the two thousand hoboes
lay beside the track. But that night the good people of Council Bluffs
went the railroad officials one better. A mob formed in Council
Bluffs, crossed the river to Omaha, and there joined with another mob
in a raid on the Union Pacific yards. First they captured an engine,
next they knocked a train together, and then the united mobs piled
aboard, crossed the Missouri, and ran down the Rock Island right of
way to turn the train over to us. The railway officials tried to
copper this play, but fell down, to the mortal terror of the section
boss and one member of the section gang at Weston. This pair, under
secret telegraphic orders, tried to wreck our train-load of
sympathizers by tearing up the track. It happened that we were
suspicious and had our patrols out. Caught red-handed at
train-wrecking, and surrounded by twenty hundred infuriated hoboes,
that section-gang boss and assistant prepared to meet death. I don't
remember what saved them, unless it was the arrival of the train.

It was our turn to fall down, and we did, hard. In their haste, the
two mobs had neglected to make up a sufficiently long train. There
wasn't room for two thousand hoboes to ride. So the mobs and the
hoboes had a talkfest, fraternized, sang songs, and parted, the mobs
going back on their captured train to Omaha, the hoboes pulling out
next morning on a hundred-and-forty-mile march to Des Moines. It was
not until Kelly's Army crossed the Missouri that it began to walk,
and after that it never rode again. It cost the railroads slathers of
money, but they were acting on principle, and they won.

Underwood, Leola, Menden, Avoca, Walnut, Marno, Atlantic, Wyoto,
Anita, Adair, Adam, Casey, Stuart, Dexter, Carlham, De Soto, Van
Meter, Booneville, Commerce, Valley Junction--how the names of the
towns come back to me as I con the map and trace our route through the
fat Iowa country! And the hospitable Iowa farmer-folk! They turned out
with their wagons and carried our baggage; gave us hot lunches at noon
by the wayside; mayors of comfortable little towns made speeches of
welcome and hastened us on our way; deputations of little girls and
maidens came out to meet us, and the good citizens turned out by
hundreds, locked arms, and marched with us down their main streets. It
was circus day when we came to town, and every day was circus day, for
there were many towns.

In the evenings our camps were invaded by whole populations. Every
company had its campfire, and around each fire something was doing.
The cooks in my company, Company L, were song-and-dance artists and
contributed most of our entertainment. In another part of the
encampment the glee club would be singing--one of its star voices was
the ""Dentist,"" drawn from Company L, and we were mighty proud of him.
Also, he pulled teeth for the whole army, and, since the extractions
usually occurred at meal-time, our digestions were stimulated by
variety of incident. The Dentist had no anaesthetics, but two or three
of us were always on tap to volunteer to hold down the patient. In
addition to the stunts of the companies and the glee club, church
services were usually held, local preachers officiating, and always
there was a great making of political speeches. All these things ran
neck and neck; it was a full-blown Midway. A lot of talent can be dug
out of two thousand hoboes. I remember we had a picked baseball nine,
and on Sundays we made a practice of putting it all over the local
nines. Sometimes we did it twice on Sundays.

Last year, while on a lecturing trip, I rode into Des Moines in a
Pullman--I don't mean a ""side-door Pullman,"" but the real thing. On
the outskirts of the city I saw the old stove-works, and my heart
leaped. It was there, at the stove-works, a dozen years before, that
the Army lay down and swore a mighty oath that its feet were sore and
that it would walk no more. We took possession of the stove-works and
told Des Moines that we had come to stay--that we'd walked in, but
we'd be blessed if we'd walk out. Des Moines was hospitable, but this
was too much of a good thing. Do a little mental arithmetic, gentle
reader. Two thousand hoboes, eating three square meals, make six
thousand meals per day, forty-two thousand meals per week, or one
hundred and sixty-eight thousand meals per shortest month in the
calendar. That's going some. We had no money. It was up to Des Moines.

Des Moines was desperate. We lay in camp, made political speeches,
held sacred concerts, pulled teeth, played baseball and seven-up, and
ate our six thousand meals per day, and Des Moines paid for it. Des
Moines pleaded with the railroads, but they were obdurate; they had
said we shouldn't ride, and that settled it. To permit us to ride
would be to establish a precedent, and there weren't going to be any
precedents. And still we went on eating. That was the terrifying
factor in the situation. We were bound for Washington, and Des Moines
would have had to float municipal bonds to pay all our railroad fares,
even at special rates, and if we remained much longer, she'd have to
float bonds anyway to feed us.

Then some local genius solved the problem. We wouldn't walk. Very
good. We should ride. From Des Moines to Keokuk on the Mississippi
flowed the Des Moines River. This particular stretch of river was
three hundred miles long. We could ride on it, said the local genius;
and, once equipped with floating stock, we could ride on down the
Mississippi to the Ohio, and thence up the Ohio, winding up with a
short portage over the mountains to Washington.

Des Moines took up a subscription. Public-spirited citizens
contributed several thousand dollars. Lumber, rope, nails, and cotton
for calking were bought in large quantities, and on the banks of the
Des Moines was inaugurated a tremendous era of shipbuilding. Now the
Des Moines is a picayune stream, unduly dignified by the appellation
of ""river."" In our spacious western land it would be called a ""creek.""
The oldest inhabitants shook their heads and said we couldn't make it,
that there wasn't enough water to float us. Des Moines didn't care,
so long as it got rid of us, and we were such well-fed optimists that
we didn't care either.

On Wednesday, May 9, 1894, we got under way and started on our
colossal picnic. Des Moines had got off pretty easily, and she
certainly owes a statue in bronze to the local genius who got her out
of her difficulty. True, Des Moines had to pay for our boats; we had
eaten sixty-six thousand meals at the stove-works; and we took twelve
thousand additional meals along with us in our commissary--as a
precaution against famine in the wilds; but then, think what it would
have meant if we had remained at Des Moines eleven months instead of
eleven days. Also, when we departed, we promised Des Moines we'd come
back if the river failed to float us.

It was all very well having twelve thousand meals in the commissary,
and no doubt the commissary ""ducks"" enjoyed them; for the commissary
promptly got lost, and my boat, for one, never saw it again. The
company formation was hopelessly broken up during the river-trip. In
any camp of men there will always be found a certain percentage of
shirks, of helpless, of just ordinary, and of hustlers. There were ten
men in my boat, and they were the cream of Company L. Every man was a
hustler. For two reasons I was included in the ten. First, I was as
good a hustler as ever ""threw his feet,"" and next, I was ""Sailor
Jack."" I understood boats and boating. The ten of us forgot the
remaining forty men of Company L, and by the time we had missed one
meal we promptly forgot the commissary. We were independent. We went
down the river ""on our own,"" hustling our ""chewin's,"" beating every
boat in the fleet, and, alas that I must say it, sometimes taking
possession of the stores the farmer-folk had collected for the Army.

For a good part of the three hundred miles we were from half a day to
a day or so in advance of the Army. We had managed to get hold of
several American flags. When we approached a small town, or when we
saw a group of farmers gathered on the bank, we ran up our flags,
called ourselves the ""advance boat,"" and demanded to know what
provisions had been collected for the Army. We represented the Army,
of course, and the provisions were turned over to us. But there
wasn't anything small about us. We never took more than we could get
away with. But we did take the cream of everything. For instance, if
some philanthropic farmer had donated several dollars' worth of
tobacco, we took it. So, also, we took butter and sugar, coffee and
canned goods; but when the stores consisted of sacks of beans and
flour, or two or three slaughtered steers, we resolutely refrained and
went our way, leaving orders to turn such provisions over to the
commissary boats whose business was to follow behind us.

My, but the ten of us did live on the fat of the land! For a long time
General Kelly vainly tried to head us off. He sent two rowers, in a
light, round-bottomed boat, to overtake us and put a stop to our
piratical careers. They overtook us all right, but they were two and
we were ten. They were empowered by General Kelly to make us
prisoners, and they told us so. When we expressed disinclination to
become prisoners, they hurried ahead to the next town to invoke the
aid of the authorities. We went ashore immediately and cooked an early
supper; and under the cloak of darkness we ran by the town and its
authorities.

I kept a diary on part of the trip, and as I read it over now I note
one persistently recurring phrase, namely, ""Living fine."" We did live
fine. We even disdained to use coffee boiled in water. We made our
coffee out of milk, calling the wonderful beverage, if I remember
rightly, ""pale Vienna.""

While we were ahead, skimming the cream, and while the commissary was
lost far behind, the main Army, coming along in the middle, starved.
This was hard on the Army, I'll allow; but then, the ten of us were
individualists. We had initiative and enterprise. We ardently believed
that the grub was to the man who got there first, the pale Vienna to
the strong. On one stretch the Army went forty-eight hours without
grub; and then it arrived at a small village of some three hundred
inhabitants, the name of which I do not remember, though I think it
was Red Rock. This town, following the practice of all towns through
which the Army passed, had appointed a committee of safety. Counting
five to a family, Red Rock consisted of sixty households. Her
committee of safety was scared stiff by the eruption of two thousand
hungry hoboes who lined their boats two and three deep along the
river bank. General Kelly was a fair man. He had no intention of
working a hardship on the village. He did not expect sixty households
to furnish two thousand meals. Besides, the Army had its
treasure-chest.

But the committee of safety lost its head. ""No encouragement to the
invader"" was its programme, and when General Kelly wanted to buy food,
the committee turned him down. It had nothing to sell; General Kelly's
money was ""no good"" in their burg. And then General Kelly went into
action. The bugles blew. The Army left the boats and on top of the
bank formed in battle array. The committee was there to see. General
Kelly's speech was brief.

""Boys,"" he said, ""when did you eat last?""

""Day before yesterday,"" they shouted.

""Are you hungry?""

A mighty affirmation from two thousand throats shook the atmosphere.
Then General Kelly turned to the committee of safety:--

""You see, gentlemen, the situation. My men have eaten nothing in
forty-eight hours. If I turn them loose upon your town, I'll not be
responsible for what happens. They are desperate. I offered to buy
food for them, but you refused to sell. I now withdraw my offer.
Instead, I shall demand. I give you five minutes to decide. Either
kill me six steers and give me four thousand rations, or I turn the
men loose. Five minutes, gentlemen.""

The terrified committee of safety looked at the two thousand hungry
hoboes and collapsed. It didn't wait the five minutes. It wasn't going
to take any chances. The killing of the steers and the collecting of
the requisition began forthwith, and the Army dined.

And still the ten graceless individualists soared along ahead and
gathered in everything in sight. But General Kelly fixed us. He sent
horsemen down each bank, warning farmers and townspeople against us.
They did their work thoroughly, all right. The erstwhile hospitable
farmers met us with the icy mit. Also, they summoned the constables
when we tied up to the bank, and loosed the dogs. I know. Two of the
latter caught me with a barbed-wire fence between me and the river. I
was carrying two buckets of milk for the pale Vienna. I didn't damage
the fence any; but we drank plebian coffee boiled with vulgar water,
and it was up to me to throw my feet for another pair of trousers. I
wonder, gentle reader, if you ever essayed hastily to climb a
barbed-wire fence with a bucket of milk in each hand. Ever since that
day I have had a prejudice against barbed wire, and I have gathered
statistics on the subject.

Unable to make an honest living so long as General Kelly kept his two
horsemen ahead of us, we returned to the Army and raised a revolution.
It was a small affair, but it devastated Company L of the Second
Division. The captain of Company L refused to recognize us; said we
were deserters, and traitors, and scalawags; and when he drew rations
for Company L from the commissary, he wouldn't give us any. That
captain didn't appreciate us, or he wouldn't have refused us grub.
Promptly we intrigued with the first lieutenant. He joined us with the
ten men in his boat, and in return we elected him captain of Company
M. The captain of Company L raised a roar. Down upon us came General
Kelly, Colonel Speed, and Colonel Baker. The twenty of us stood firm,
and our revolution was ratified.

But we never bothered with the commissary. Our hustlers drew better
rations from the farmers. Our new captain, however, doubted us. He
never knew when he'd see the ten of us again, once we got under way in
the morning, so he called in a blacksmith to clinch his captaincy. In
the stern of our boat, one on each side, were driven two heavy
eye-bolts of iron. Correspondingly, on the bow of his boat, were
fastened two huge iron hooks. The boats were brought together, end on,
the hooks dropped into the eye-bolts, and there we were, hard and
fast. We couldn't lose that captain. But we were irrepressible. Out of
our very manacles we wrought an invincible device that enabled us to
put it all over every other boat in the fleet.

Like all great inventions, this one of ours was accidental. We
discovered it the first time we ran on a snag in a bit of a rapid. The
head-boat hung up and anchored, and the tail-boat swung around in the
current, pivoting the head-boat on the snag. I was at the stern of the
tail-boat, steering. In vain we tried to shove off. Then I ordered the
men from the head-boat into the tail-boat. Immediately the head-boat
floated clear, and its men returned into it. After that, snags, reefs,
shoals, and bars had no terrors for us. The instant the head-boat
struck, the men in it leaped into the tail-boat. Of course, the
head-boat floated over the obstruction and the tail-boat then struck.
Like automatons, the twenty men now in the tail-boat leaped into the
head-boat, and the tail-boat floated past.

The boats used by the Army were all alike, made by the mile and sawed
off. They were flat-boats, and their lines were rectangles. Each boat
was six feet wide, ten feet long, and a foot and a half deep. Thus,
when our two boats were hooked together, I sat at the stern steering a
craft twenty feet long, containing twenty husky hoboes who ""spelled""
each other at the oars and paddles, and loaded with blankets, cooking
outfit, and our own private commissary.

Still we caused General Kelly trouble. He had called in his horsemen,
and substituted three police-boats that travelled in the van and
allowed no boats to pass them. The craft containing Company M crowded
the police-boats hard. We could have passed them easily, but it was
against the rules. So we kept a respectful distance astern and waited.
Ahead we knew was virgin farming country, unbegged and generous; but
we waited. White water was all we needed, and when we rounded a bend
and a rapid showed up we knew what would happen. Smash! Police-boat
number one goes on a boulder and hangs up. Bang! Police-boat number
two follows suit. Whop! Police-boat number three encounters the common
fate of all. Of course our boat does the same things; but one, two,
the men are out of the head-boat and into the tail-boat; one, two,
they are out of the tail-boat and into the head-boat; and one, two,
the men who belong in the tail-boat are back in it and we are dashing
on. ""Stop! you blankety-blank-blanks!"" shriek the police-boats. ""How
can we?--blank the blankety-blank river, anyway!"" we wail plaintively
as we surge past, caught in that remorseless current that sweeps us on
out of sight and into the hospitable farmer-country that replenishes
our private commissary with the cream of its contributions. Again we
drink pale Vienna and realize that the grub is to the man who gets
there.

Poor General Kelly! He devised another scheme. The whole fleet
started ahead of us. Company M of the Second Division started in its
proper place in the line, which was last. And it took us only one day
to put the ""kibosh"" on that particular scheme. Twenty-five miles of
bad water lay before us--all rapids, shoals, bars, and boulders. It
was over that stretch of water that the oldest inhabitants of Des
Moines had shaken their heads. Nearly two hundred boats entered the
bad water ahead of us, and they piled up in the most astounding
manner. We went through that stranded fleet like hemlock through the
fire. There was no avoiding the boulders, bars, and snags except by
getting out on the bank. We didn't avoid them. We went right over
them, one, two, one, two, head-boat, tail-boat, head-boat, tail-boat,
all hands back and forth and back again. We camped that night alone,
and loafed in camp all of next day while the Army patched and repaired
its wrecked boats and straggled up to us.

There was no stopping our cussedness. We rigged up a mast, piled on
the canvas (blankets), and travelled short hours while the Army worked
over-time to keep us in sight. Then General Kelly had recourse to
diplomacy. No boat could touch us in the straight-away. Without
discussion, we were the hottest bunch that ever came down the Des
Moines. The ban of the police-boats was lifted. Colonel Speed was put
aboard, and with this distinguished officer we had the honor of
arriving first at Keokuk on the Mississippi. And right here I want to
say to General Kelly and Colonel Speed that here's my hand. You were
heroes, both of you, and you were men. And I'm sorry for at least ten
per cent of the trouble that was given you by the head-boat of Company
M.

At Keokuk the whole fleet was lashed together in a huge raft, and,
after being wind-bound a day, a steamboat took us in tow down the
Mississippi to Quincy, Illinois, where we camped across the river on
Goose Island. Here the raft idea was abandoned, the boats being joined
together in groups of four and decked over. Somebody told me that
Quincy was the richest town of its size in the United States. When I
heard this, I was immediately overcome by an irresistible impulse to
throw my feet. No ""blowed-in-the-glass profesh"" could possibly pass up
such a promising burg. I crossed the river to Quincy in a small
dug-out; but I came back in a large riverboat, down to the gunwales
with the results of my thrown feet. Of course I kept all the money I
had collected, though I paid the boat-hire; also I took my pick of the
underwear, socks, cast-off clothes, shirts, ""kicks,"" and ""sky-pieces"";
and when Company M had taken all it wanted there was still a
respectable heap that was turned over to Company L. Alas, I was young
and prodigal in those days! I told a thousand ""stories"" to the good
people of Quincy, and every story was ""good""; but since I have come to
write for the magazines I have often regretted the wealth of story,
the fecundity of fiction, I lavished that day in Quincy, Illinois.

It was at Hannibal, Missouri, that the ten invincibles went to pieces.
It was not planned. We just naturally flew apart. The Boiler-Maker and
I deserted secretly. On the same day Scotty and Davy made a swift
sneak for the Illinois shore; also McAvoy and Fish achieved their
get-away. This accounts for six of the ten; what became of the
remaining four I do not know. As a sample of life on The Road, I make
the following quotation from my diary of the several days following my
desertion.

""Friday, May 25th. Boiler-Maker and I left the camp on the island. We
went ashore on the Illinois side in a skiff and walked six miles on
the C.B. & Q. to Fell Creek. We had gone six miles out of our way, but
we got on a hand-car and rode six miles to Hull's, on the Wabash.
While there, we met McAvoy, Fish, Scotty, and Davy, who had also
pulled out from the Army.

""Saturday, May 26th. At 2.11 A.M. we caught the Cannonball as she
slowed up at the crossing. Scotty and Davy were ditched. The four of
us were ditched at the Bluffs, forty miles farther on. In the
afternoon Fish and McAvoy caught a freight while Boiler-Maker and I
were away getting something to eat.

""Sunday, May 27th. At 3.21 A.M. we caught the Cannonball and found
Scotty and Davy on the blind. We were all ditched at daylight at
Jacksonville. The C. & A. runs through here, and we're going to take
that. Boiler-Maker went off, but didn't return. Guess he caught a
freight.

""Monday, May 28th. Boiler-Maker didn't show up. Scotty and Davy went
off to sleep somewhere, and didn't get back in time to catch the K.C.
passenger at 3.30 A.M. I caught her and rode her till after sunrise to
Masson City, 25,000 inhabitants. Caught a cattle train and rode all
night.

""Tuesday, May 29th. Arrived in Chicago at 7 A.M....""

       *       *       *       *       *

And years afterward, in China, I had the grief of learning that the
device we employed to navigate the rapids of the Des Moines--the
one-two-one-two, head-boat-tail-boat proposition--was not originated
by us. I learned that the Chinese river-boatmen had for thousands of
years used a similar device to negotiate ""bad water."" It is a good
stunt all right, even if we don't get the credit. It answers Dr.
Jordan's test of truth: ""Will it work? Will you trust your life to
it?""




BULLS


If the tramp were suddenly to pass away from the United States,
widespread misery for many families would follow. The tramp enables
thousands of men to earn honest livings, educate their children, and
bring them up God-fearing and industrious. I know. At one time my
father was a constable and hunted tramps for a living. The community
paid him so much per head for all the tramps he could catch, and also,
I believe, he got mileage fees. Ways and means was always a pressing
problem in our household, and the amount of meat on the table, the new
pair of shoes, the day's outing, or the text-book for school, were
dependent upon my father's luck in the chase. Well I remember the
suppressed eagerness and the suspense with which I waited to learn
each morning what the results of his past night's toil had been--how
many tramps he had gathered in and what the chances were for
convicting them. And so it was, when later, as a tramp, I succeeded in
eluding some predatory constable, I could not but feel sorry for the
little boys and girls at home in that constable's house; it seemed to
me in a way that I was defrauding those little boys and girls of some
of the good things of life.

But it's all in the game. The hobo defies society, and society's
watch-dogs make a living out of him. Some hoboes like to be caught by
the watch-dogs--especially in winter-time. Of course, such hoboes
select communities where the jails are ""good,"" wherein no work is
performed and the food is substantial. Also, there have been, and most
probably still are, constables who divide their fees with the hoboes
they arrest. Such a constable does not have to hunt. He whistles, and
the game comes right up to his hand. It is surprising, the money that
is made out of stone-broke tramps. All through the South--at least
when I was hoboing--are convict camps and plantations, where the time
of convicted hoboes is bought by the farmers, and where the hoboes
simply have to work. Then there are places like the quarries at
Rutland, Vermont, where the hobo is exploited, the unearned energy in
his body, which he has accumulated by ""battering on the drag"" or
""slamming gates,"" being extracted for the benefit of that particular
community.

Now I don't know anything about the quarries at Rutland, Vermont. I'm
very glad that I don't, when I remember how near I was to getting into
them. Tramps pass the word along, and I first heard of those quarries
when I was in Indiana. But when I got into New England, I heard of
them continually, and always with danger-signals flying. ""They want
men in the quarries,"" the passing hoboes said; ""and they never give a
'stiff' less than ninety days."" By the time I got into New Hampshire I
was pretty well keyed up over those quarries, and I fought shy of
railroad cops, ""bulls,"" and constables as I never had before.

One evening I went down to the railroad yards at Concord and found a
freight train made up and ready to start. I located an empty box-car,
slid open the side-door, and climbed in. It was my hope to win across
to White River by morning; that would bring me into Vermont and not
more than a thousand miles from Rutland. But after that, as I worked
north, the distance between me and the point of danger would begin to
increase. In the car I found a ""gay-cat,"" who displayed unusual
trepidation at my entrance. He took me for a ""shack"" (brakeman), and
when he learned I was only a stiff, he began talking about the
quarries at Rutland as the cause of the fright I had given him. He was
a young country fellow, and had beaten his way only over local
stretches of road.

The freight got under way, and we lay down in one end of the box-car
and went to sleep. Two or three hours afterward, at a stop, I was
awakened by the noise of the right-hand door being softly slid open.
The gay-cat slept on. I made no movement, though I veiled my eyes with
my lashes to a little slit through which I could see out. A lantern
was thrust in through the doorway, followed by the head of a shack. He
discovered us, and looked at us for a moment. I was prepared for a
violent expression on his part, or the customary ""Hit the grit, you
son of a toad!"" Instead of this he cautiously withdrew the lantern and
very, very softly slid the door to. This struck me as eminently
unusual and suspicious. I listened, and softly I heard the hasp drop
into place. The door was latched on the outside. We could not open it
from the inside. One way of sudden exit from that car was blocked. It
would never do. I waited a few seconds, then crept to the left-hand
door and tried it. It was not yet latched. I opened it, dropped to the
ground, and closed it behind me. Then I passed across the bumpers to
the other side of the train. I opened the door the shack had latched,
climbed in, and closed it behind me. Both exits were available again.
The gay-cat was still asleep.

The train got under way. It came to the next stop. I heard footsteps
in the gravel. Then the left-hand door was thrown open noisily. The
gay-cat awoke, I made believe to awake; and we sat up and stared at
the shack and his lantern. He didn't waste any time getting down to
business.

""I want three dollars,"" he said.

We got on our feet and came nearer to him to confer. We expressed an
absolute and devoted willingness to give him three dollars, but
explained our wretched luck that compelled our desire to remain
unsatisfied. The shack was incredulous. He dickered with us. He would
compromise for two dollars. We regretted our condition of poverty. He
said uncomplimentary things, called us sons of toads, and damned us
from hell to breakfast. Then he threatened. He explained that if we
didn't dig up, he'd lock us in and carry us on to White River and turn
us over to the authorities. He also explained all about the quarries
at Rutland.

Now that shack thought he had us dead to rights. Was not he guarding
the one door, and had he not himself latched the opposite door but a
few minutes before? When he began talking about quarries, the
frightened gay-cat started to sidle across to the other door. The
shack laughed loud and long. ""Don't be in a hurry,"" he said; ""I locked
that door on the outside at the last stop."" So implicitly did he
believe the door to be locked that his words carried conviction. The
gay-cat believed and was in despair.

The shack delivered his ultimatum. Either we should dig up two
dollars, or he would lock us in and turn us over to the constable at
White River--and that meant ninety days and the quarries. Now, gentle
reader, just suppose that the other door had been locked. Behold the
precariousness of human life. For lack of a dollar, I'd have gone to
the quarries and served three months as a convict slave. So would the
gay-cat. Count me out, for I was hopeless; but consider the gay-cat.
He might have come out, after those ninety days, pledged to a life of
crime. And later he might have broken your skull, even your skull,
with a blackjack in an endeavor to take possession of the money on
your person--and if not your skull, then some other poor and
unoffending creature's skull.

But the door was unlocked, and I alone knew it. The gay-cat and I
begged for mercy. I joined in the pleading and wailing out of sheer
cussedness, I suppose. But I did my best. I told a ""story"" that would
have melted the heart of any mug; but it didn't melt the heart of that
sordid money-grasper of a shack. When he became convinced that we
didn't have any money, he slid the door shut and latched it, then
lingered a moment on the chance that we had fooled him and that we
would now offer him the two dollars.

Then it was that I let out a few links. I called him a son of a toad.
I called him all the other things he had called me. And then I called
him a few additional things. I came from the West, where men knew how
to swear, and I wasn't going to let any mangy shack on a measly New
England ""jerk"" put it over me in vividness and vigor of language. At
first the shack tried to laugh it down. Then he made the mistake of
attempting to reply. I let out a few more links, and I cut him to the
raw and therein rubbed winged and flaming epithets. Nor was my fine
frenzy all whim and literary; I was indignant at this vile creature,
who, in default of a dollar, would consign me to three months of
slavery. Furthermore, I had a sneaking idea that he got a ""drag"" out
of the constable fees.

But I fixed him. I lacerated his feelings and pride several dollars'
worth. He tried to scare me by threatening to come in after me and
kick the stuffing out of me. In return, I promised to kick him in the
face while he was climbing in. The advantage of position was with me,
and he saw it. So he kept the door shut and called for help from the
rest of the train-crew. I could hear them answering and crunching
through the gravel to him. And all the time the other door was
unlatched, and they didn't know it; and in the meantime the gay-cat
was ready to die with fear.

Oh, I was a hero--with my line of retreat straight behind me. I
slanged the shack and his mates till they threw the door open and I
could see their infuriated faces in the shine of the lanterns. It was
all very simple to them. They had us cornered in the car, and they
were going to come in and man-handle us. They started. I didn't kick
anybody in the face. I jerked the opposite door open, and the gay-cat
and I went out. The train-crew took after us.

We went over--if I remember correctly--a stone fence. But I have no
doubts of recollection about where we found ourselves. In the darkness
I promptly fell over a grave-stone. The gay-cat sprawled over another.
And then we got the chase of our lives through that graveyard. The
ghosts must have thought we were going some. So did the train-crew,
for when we emerged from the graveyard and plunged across a road into
a dark wood, the shacks gave up the pursuit and went back to their
train. A little later that night the gay-cat and I found ourselves at
the well of a farmhouse. We were after a drink of water, but we
noticed a small rope that ran down one side of the well. We hauled it
up and found on the end of it a gallon-can of cream. And that is as
near as I got to the quarries of Rutland, Vermont.

When hoboes pass the word along, concerning a town, that ""the bulls is
horstile,"" avoid that town, or, if you must, go through softly. There
are some towns that one must always go through softly. Such a town was
Cheyenne, on the Union Pacific. It had a national reputation for being
""horstile,""--and it was all due to the efforts of one Jeff Carr (if I
remember his name aright). Jeff Carr could size up the ""front"" of a
hobo on the instant. He never entered into discussion. In the one
moment he sized up the hobo, and in the next he struck out with both
fists, a club, or anything else he had handy. After he had man-handled
the hobo, he started him out of town with a promise of worse if he
ever saw him again. Jeff Carr knew the game. North, south, east, and
west to the uttermost confines of the United States (Canada and Mexico
included), the man-handled hoboes carried the word that Cheyenne was
""horstile."" Fortunately, I never encountered Jeff Carr. I passed
through Cheyenne in a blizzard. There were eighty-four hoboes with me
at the time. The strength of numbers made us pretty nonchalant on
most things, but not on Jeff Carr. The connotation of ""Jeff Carr""
stunned our imagination, numbed our virility, and the whole gang was
mortally scared of meeting him.

It rarely pays to stop and enter into explanations with bulls when
they look ""horstile."" A swift get-away is the thing to do. It took me
some time to learn this; but the finishing touch was put upon me by a
bull in New York City. Ever since that time it has been an automatic
process with me to make a run for it when I see a bull reaching for
me. This automatic process has become a mainspring of conduct in me,
wound up and ready for instant release. I shall never get over it.
Should I be eighty years old, hobbling along the street on crutches,
and should a policeman suddenly reach out for me, I know I'd drop the
crutches and run like a deer.

The finishing touch to my education in bulls was received on a hot
summer afternoon in New York City. It was during a week of scorching
weather. I had got into the habit of throwing my feet in the morning,
and of spending the afternoon in the little park that is hard by
Newspaper Row and the City Hall. It was near there that I could buy
from pushcart men current books (that had been injured in the making
or binding) for a few cents each. Then, right in the park itself, were
little booths where one could buy glorious, ice-cold, sterilized milk
and buttermilk at a penny a glass. Every afternoon I sat on a bench
and read, and went on a milk debauch. I got away with from five to ten
glasses each afternoon. It was dreadfully hot weather.

So here I was, a meek and studious milk-drinking hobo, and behold what
I got for it. One afternoon I arrived at the park, a fresh
book-purchase under my arm and a tremendous buttermilk thirst under my
shirt. In the middle of the street, in front of the City Hall, I
noticed, as I came along heading for the buttermilk booth, that a
crowd had formed. It was right where I was crossing the street, so I
stopped to see the cause of the collection of curious men. At first I
could see nothing. Then, from the sounds I heard and from a glimpse I
caught, I knew that it was a bunch of gamins playing pee-wee. Now
pee-wee is not permitted in the streets of New York. I didn't know
that, but I learned pretty lively. I had paused possibly thirty
seconds, in which time I had learned the cause of the crowd, when I
heard a gamin yell ""Bull!"" The gamins knew their business. They ran. I
didn't.

The crowd broke up immediately and started for the sidewalk on both
sides of the street. I started for the sidewalk on the park-side.
There must have been fifty men, who had been in the original crowd,
who were heading in the same direction. We were loosely strung out. I
noticed the bull, a strapping policeman in a gray suit. He was coming
along the middle of the street, without haste, merely sauntering. I
noticed casually that he changed his course, and was heading obliquely
for the same sidewalk that I was heading for directly. He sauntered
along, threading the strung-out crowd, and I noticed that his course
and mine would cross each other. I was so innocent of wrong-doing
that, in spite of my education in bulls and their ways, I apprehended
nothing. I never dreamed that bull was after me. Out of my respect for
the law I was actually all ready to pause the next moment and let him
cross in front of me. The pause came all right, but it was not of my
volition; also it was a backward pause. Without warning, that bull had
suddenly launched out at me on the chest with both hands. At the same
moment, verbally, he cast the bar sinister on my genealogy.

All my free American blood boiled. All my liberty-loving ancestors
clamored in me. ""What do you mean?"" I demanded. You see, I wanted an
explanation. And I got it. Bang! His club came down on top of my head,
and I was reeling backward like a drunken man, the curious faces of
the onlookers billowing up and down like the waves of the sea, my
precious book falling from under my arm into the dirt, the bull
advancing with the club ready for another blow. And in that dizzy
moment I had a vision. I saw that club descending many times upon my
head; I saw myself, bloody and battered and hard-looking, in a
police-court; I heard a charge of disorderly conduct, profane
language, resisting an officer, and a few other things, read by a
clerk; and I saw myself across in Blackwell's Island. Oh, I knew the
game. I lost all interest in explanations. I didn't stop to pick up my
precious, unread book. I turned and ran. I was pretty sick, but I
ran. And run I shall, to my dying day, whenever a bull begins to
explain with a club.

Why, years after my tramping days, when I was a student in the
University of California, one night I went to the circus. After the
show and the concert I lingered on to watch the working of the
transportation machinery of a great circus. The circus was leaving
that night. By a bonfire I came upon a bunch of small boys. There were
about twenty of them, and as they talked with one another I learned
that they were going to run away with the circus. Now the circus-men
didn't want to be bothered with this mess of urchins, and a telephone
to police headquarters had ""coppered"" the play. A squad of ten
policemen had been despatched to the scene to arrest the small boys
for violating the nine o'clock curfew ordinance. The policemen
surrounded the bonfire, and crept up close to it in the darkness. At
the signal, they made a rush, each policeman grabbing at the
youngsters as he would grab into a basket of squirming eels.

Now I didn't know anything about the coming of the police; and when I
saw the sudden eruption of brass-buttoned, helmeted bulls, each of
them reaching with both hands, all the forces and stability of my
being were overthrown. Remained only the automatic process to run. And
I ran. I didn't know I was running. I didn't know anything. It was, as
I have said, automatic. There was no reason for me to run. I was not a
hobo. I was a citizen of that community. It was my home town. I was
guilty of no wrong-doing. I was a college man. I had even got my name
in the papers, and I wore good clothes that had never been slept in.
And yet I ran--blindly, madly, like a startled deer, for over a block.
And when I came to myself, I noted that I was still running. It
required a positive effort of will to stop those legs of mine.

No, I'll never get over it. I can't help it. When a bull reaches, I
run. Besides, I have an unhappy faculty for getting into jail. I have
been in jail more times since I was a hobo than when I was one. I
start out on a Sunday morning with a young lady on a bicycle ride.
Before we can get outside the city limits we are arrested for passing
a pedestrian on the sidewalk. I resolve to be more careful. The next
time I am on a bicycle it is night-time and my acetylene-gas-lamp is
misbehaving. I cherish the sickly flame carefully, because of the
ordinance. I am in a hurry, but I ride at a snail's pace so as not to
jar out the flickering flame. I reach the city limits; I am beyond the
jurisdiction of the ordinance; and I proceed to scorch to make up for
lost time. And half a mile farther on I am ""pinched"" by a bull, and
the next morning I forfeit my bail in the police court. The city had
treacherously extended its limits into a mile of the country, and I
didn't know, that was all. I remember my inalienable right of free
speech and peaceable assemblage, and I get up on a soap-box to trot
out the particular economic bees that buzz in my bonnet, and a bull
takes me off that box and leads me to the city prison, and after that
I get out on bail. It's no use. In Korea I used to be arrested about
every other day. It was the same thing in Manchuria. The last time I
was in Japan I broke into jail under the pretext of being a Russian
spy. It wasn't my pretext, but it got me into jail just the same.
There is no hope for me. I am fated to do the Prisoner-of-Chillon
stunt yet. This is prophecy.

I once hypnotized a bull on Boston Common. It was past midnight and he
had me dead to rights; but before I got done with him he had ponied up
a silver quarter and given me the address of an all-night restaurant.
Then there was a bull in Bristol, New Jersey, who caught me and let me
go, and heaven knows he had provocation enough to put me in jail. I
hit him the hardest I'll wager he was ever hit in his life. It
happened this way. About midnight I nailed a freight out of
Philadelphia. The shacks ditched me. She was pulling out slowly
through the maze of tracks and switches of the freight-yards. I nailed
her again, and again I was ditched. You see, I had to nail her
""outside,"" for she was a through freight with every door locked and
sealed.

The second time I was ditched the shack gave me a lecture. He told me
I was risking my life, that it was a fast freight and that she went
some. I told him I was used to going some myself, but it was no go. He
said he wouldn't permit me to commit suicide, and I hit the grit. But
I nailed her a third time, getting in between on the bumpers. They
were the most meagre bumpers I had ever seen--I do not refer to the
real bumpers, the iron bumpers that are connected by the
coupling-link and that pound and grind on each other; what I refer to
are the beams, like huge cleats, that cross the ends of freight cars
just above the bumpers. When one rides the bumpers, he stands on these
cleats, one foot on each, the bumpers between his feet and just
beneath.

But the beams or cleats I found myself on were not the broad, generous
ones that at that time were usually on box-cars. On the contrary, they
were very narrow--not more than an inch and a half in breadth. I
couldn't get half of the width of my sole on them. Then there was
nothing to which to hold with my hands. True, there were the ends of
the two box-cars; but those ends were flat, perpendicular surfaces.
There were no grips. I could only press the flats of my palms against
the car-ends for support. But that would have been all right if the
cleats for my feet had been decently wide.

As the freight got out of Philadelphia she began to hit up speed. Then
I understood what the shack had meant by suicide. The freight went
faster and faster. She was a through freight, and there was nothing to
stop her. On that section of the Pennsylvania four tracks run side by
side, and my east-bound freight didn't need to worry about passing
west-bound freights, nor about being overtaken by east-bound
expresses. She had the track to herself, and she used it. I was in a
precarious situation. I stood with the mere edges of my feet on the
narrow projections, the palms of my hands pressing desperately against
the flat, perpendicular ends of each car. And those cars moved, and
moved individually, up and down and back and forth. Did you ever see a
circus rider, standing on two running horses, with one foot on the
back of each horse? Well, that was what I was doing, with several
differences. The circus rider had the reins to hold on to, while I had
nothing; he stood on the broad soles of his feet, while I stood on the
edges of mine; he bent his legs and body, gaining the strength of the
arch in his posture and achieving the stability of a low centre of
gravity, while I was compelled to stand upright and keep my legs
straight; he rode face forward, while I was riding sidewise; and also,
if he fell off, he'd get only a roll in the sawdust, while I'd have
been ground to pieces beneath the wheels.

And that freight was certainly going some, roaring and shrieking,
swinging madly around curves, thundering over trestles, one car-end
bumping up when the other was jarring down, or jerking to the right at
the same moment the other was lurching to the left, and with me all
the while praying and hoping for the train to stop. But she didn't
stop. She didn't have to. For the first, last, and only time on The
Road, I got all I wanted. I abandoned the bumpers and managed to get
out on a side-ladder; it was ticklish work, for I had never
encountered car-ends that were so parsimonious of hand-holds and
foot-holds as those car-ends were.

I heard the engine whistling, and I felt the speed easing down. I knew
the train wasn't going to stop, but my mind was made up to chance it
if she slowed down sufficiently. The right of way at this point took a
curve, crossed a bridge over a canal, and cut through the town of
Bristol. This combination compelled slow speed. I clung on to the
side-ladder and waited. I didn't know it was the town of Bristol we
were approaching. I did not know what necessitated slackening in
speed. All I knew was that I wanted to get off. I strained my eyes in
the darkness for a street-crossing on which to land. I was pretty well
down the train, and before my car was in the town the engine was past
the station and I could feel her making speed again.

Then came the street. It was too dark to see how wide it was or what
was on the other side. I knew I needed all of that street if I was to
remain on my feet after I struck. I dropped off on the near side. It
sounds easy. By ""dropped off"" I mean just this: I first of all, on the
side-ladder, thrust my body forward as far as I could in the direction
the train was going--this to give as much space as possible in which
to gain backward momentum when I swung off. Then I swung, swung out
and backward, backward with all my might, and let go--at the same time
throwing myself backward as if I intended to strike the ground on the
back of my head. The whole effort was to overcome as much as possible
the primary forward momentum the train had imparted to my body. When
my feet hit the grit, my body was lying backward on the air at an
angle of forty-five degrees. I had reduced the forward momentum some,
for when my feet struck, I did not immediately pitch forward on my
face. Instead, my body rose to the perpendicular and began to incline
forward. In point of fact, my body proper still retained much
momentum, while my feet, through contact with the earth, had lost all
their momentum. This momentum the feet had lost I had to supply anew
by lifting them as rapidly as I could and running them forward in
order to keep them under my forward-moving body. The result was that
my feet beat a rapid and explosive tattoo clear across the street. I
didn't dare stop them. If I had, I'd have pitched forward. It was up
to me to keep on going.

I was an involuntary projectile, worrying about what was on the other
side of the street and hoping that it wouldn't be a stone wall or a
telegraph pole. And just then I hit something. Horrors! I saw it just
the instant before the disaster--of all things, a bull, standing there
in the darkness. We went down together, rolling over and over; and the
automatic process was such in that miserable creature that in the
moment of impact he reached out and clutched me and never let go. We
were both knocked out, and he held on to a very lamb-like hobo while
he recovered.

If that bull had any imagination, he must have thought me a traveller
from other worlds, the man from Mars just arriving; for in the
darkness he hadn't seen me swing from the train. In fact, his first
words were: ""Where did you come from?"" His next words, and before I
had time to answer, were: ""I've a good mind to run you in."" This
latter, I am convinced, was likewise automatic. He was a really good
bull at heart, for after I had told him a ""story"" and helped brush off
his clothes, he gave me until the next freight to get out of town. I
stipulated two things: first, that the freight be east-bound, and
second, that it should not be a through freight with all doors sealed
and locked. To this he agreed, and thus, by the terms of the Treaty of
Bristol, I escaped being pinched.

I remember another night, in that part of the country, when I just
missed another bull. If I had hit him, I'd have telescoped him, for I
was coming down from above, all holds free, with several other bulls
one jump behind and reaching for me. This is how it happened. I had
been lodging in a livery stable in Washington. I had a box-stall and
unnumbered horse-blankets all to myself. In return for such sumptuous
accommodation I took care of a string of horses each morning. I might
have been there yet, if it hadn't been for the bulls.

One evening, about nine o'clock, I returned to the stable to go to
bed, and found a crap game in full blast. It had been a market day,
and all the negroes had money. It would be well to explain the lay of
the land. The livery stable faced on two streets. I entered the front,
passed through the office, and came to the alley between two rows of
stalls that ran the length of the building and opened out on the other
street. Midway along this alley, beneath a gas-jet and between the
rows of horses, were about forty negroes. I joined them as an
onlooker. I was broke and couldn't play. A coon was making passes and
not dragging down. He was riding his luck, and with each pass the
total stake doubled. All kinds of money lay on the floor. It was
fascinating. With each pass, the chances increased tremendously
against the coon making another pass. The excitement was intense. And
just then there came a thundering smash on the big doors that opened
on the back street.

A few of the negroes bolted in the opposite direction. I paused from
my flight a moment to grab at the all kinds of money on the floor.
This wasn't theft: it was merely custom. Every man who hadn't run was
grabbing. The doors crashed open and swung in, and through them surged
a squad of bulls. We surged the other way. It was dark in the office,
and the narrow door would not permit all of us to pass out to the
street at the same time. Things became congested. A coon took a dive
through the window, taking the sash along with him and followed by
other coons. At our rear, the bulls were nailing prisoners. A big coon
and myself made a dash at the door at the same time. He was bigger
than I, and he pivoted me and got through first. The next instant a
club swatted him on the head and he went down like a steer. Another
squad of bulls was waiting outside for us. They knew they couldn't
stop the rush with their hands, and so they were swinging their clubs.
I stumbled over the fallen coon who had pivoted me, ducked a swat from
a club, dived between a bull's legs, and was free. And then how I ran!
There was a lean mulatto just in front of me, and I took his pace. He
knew the town better than I did, and I knew that in the way he ran lay
safety. But he, on the other hand, took me for a pursuing bull. He
never looked around. He just ran. My wind was good, and I hung on to
his pace and nearly killed him. In the end he stumbled weakly, went
down on his knees, and surrendered to me. And when he discovered I
wasn't a bull, all that saved me was that he didn't have any wind left
in him.

That was why I left Washington--not on account of the mulatto, but on
account of the bulls. I went down to the depot and caught the first
blind out on a Pennsylvania Railroad express. After the train got good
and under way and I noted the speed she was making, a misgiving smote
me. This was a four-track railroad, and the engines took water on the
fly. Hoboes had long since warned me never to ride the first blind on
trains where the engines took water on the fly. And now let me
explain. Between the tracks are shallow metal troughs. As the engine,
at full speed, passes above, a sort of chute drops down into the
trough. The result is that all the water in the trough rushes up the
chute and fills the tender.

Somewhere along between Washington and Baltimore, as I sat on the
platform of the blind, a fine spray began to fill the air. It did no
harm. Ah, ha, thought I; it's all a bluff, this taking water on the
fly being bad for the bo on the first blind. What does this little
spray amount to? Then I began to marvel at the device. This was
railroading! Talk about your primitive Western railroading--and just
then the tender filled up, and it hadn't reached the end of the
trough. A tidal wave of water poured over the back of the tender and
down upon me. I was soaked to the skin, as wet as if I had fallen
overboard.

The train pulled into Baltimore. As is the custom in the great Eastern
cities, the railroad ran beneath the level of the streets on the
bottom of a big ""cut."" As the train pulled into the lighted depot, I
made myself as small as possible on the blind. But a railroad bull saw
me, and gave chase. Two more joined him. I was past the depot, and I
ran straight on down the track. I was in a sort of trap. On each side
of me rose the steep walls of the cut, and if I ever essayed them and
failed, I knew that I'd slide back into the clutches of the bulls. I
ran on and on, studying the walls of the cut for a favorable place to
climb up. At last I saw such a place. It came just after I had passed
under a bridge that carried a level street across the cut. Up the
steep slope I went, clawing hand and foot. The three railroad bulls
were clawing up right after me.

At the top, I found myself in a vacant lot. On one side was a low wall
that separated it from the street. There was no time for minute
investigation. They were at my heels. I headed for the wall and
vaulted it. And right there was where I got the surprise of my life.
One is used to thinking that one side of a wall is just as high as the
other side. But that wall was different. You see, the vacant lot was
much higher than the level of the street. On my side the wall was low,
but on the other side--well, as I came soaring over the top, all holds
free, it seemed to me that I was falling feet-first, plump into an
abyss. There beneath me, on the sidewalk, under the light of a
street-lamp was a bull. I guess it was nine or ten feet down to the
sidewalk; but in the shock of surprise in mid-air it seemed twice that
distance.

I straightened out in the air and came down. At first I thought I was
going to land on the bull. My clothes did brush him as my feet struck
the sidewalk with explosive impact. It was a wonder he didn't drop
dead, for he hadn't heard me coming. It was the man-from-Mars stunt
over again. The bull did jump. He shied away from me like a horse from
an auto; and then he reached for me. I didn't stop to explain. I left
that to my pursuers, who were dropping over the wall rather gingerly.
But I got a chase all right. I ran up one street and down another,
dodged around corners, and at last got away.

After spending some of the coin I'd got from the crap game and killing
off an hour of time, I came back to the railroad cut, just outside the
lights of the depot, and waited for a train. My blood had cooled down,
and I shivered miserably, what of my wet clothes. At last a train
pulled into the station. I lay low in the darkness, and successfully
boarded her when she pulled out, taking good care this time to make
the second blind. No more water on the fly in mine. The train ran
forty miles to the first stop. I got off in a lighted depot that was
strangely familiar. I was back in Washington. In some way, during the
excitement of the get-away in Baltimore, running through strange
streets, dodging and turning and retracing, I had got turned around. I
had taken the train out the wrong way. I had lost a night's sleep, I
had been soaked to the skin, I had been chased for my life; and for
all my pains I was back where I had started. Oh, no, life on The Road
is not all beer and skittles. But I didn't go back to the livery
stable. I had done some pretty successful grabbing, and I didn't want
to reckon up with the coons. So I caught the next train out, and ate
my breakfast in Baltimore.

              Would this be the last poker game--with all
              life at stake and every card a mere deuce?


MacPherson shuffled the cards over and over again. His hands were
almost steady.

""Want to place a limit on the bets?"" he asked.

His two colleagues who had made the night drive with him from the
University said nothing, but Rothman laughed.

""Today?"" he said. ""Today, the sky's the limit.""

MacPherson rested the deck on the table and watched as Rothman stood
up to look through the barred window at the glittering Arizona desert.
Rothman had got thinner during his months of confinement; his shoulders
were bony beneath the gray hospital robe and his balding head looked
like a skull.

""Are you going to play?"" asked MacPherson. ""Or is poker too childish an
amusement for a mathematician?""

Rothman turned his back to the window. ""Oh, I'll play. When three old
friends from the Project suddenly turn up for a visit, even a madman
will string along.""

Shuffling the cards again, MacPherson wished the other men would say
something; it wasn't fair of them to make him carry the conversation.
Professor Avery, who had cut his physics classes in order to join the
morning's party, sat in glum silence. His plump face was pale, and
behind thick-lensed spectacles which enlarged his eyes grotesquely, he
blinked as he watched the flickering cards. Dr. Neill, from Physical
Chemistry, was tapping his toe against the table leg, watching Rothman,
who stood at the window, waiting.

""But we can't have much of a game with only four people,"" said Rothman.
""We ought to have a fifth.""

""Maybe we can find someone."" MacPherson walked to the locked steel door
and rattled the rectangular lattice set in at shoulder height, put his
mouth to the metal bars and called out.

""Hey, Joe!""

       *       *       *       *       *

An attendant in white uniform shuffled into the corridor of closed
doors, carrying a tray with one hand and scratching his head with the
other.

""How about joining us for a game of poker?""

Joe shook his head and grinned. ""Not me, Professor! I start buddying
around with the loonies, I lose my job.""

""But we're not inmates!""

""Maybe not, but Dr. Rothman is.""

""Doesn't prove I'm crazy, Joe,"" said Rothman. ""Conversely, not being
inmates doesn't prove these men are sane.""

""It's a fact you don't look any crazier to me than a lot of
professors,"" confessed Joe. ""I don't know. All I know is, _I'm_
not crazy enough to break the rules and lose my job. Besides, you
long-hairs wouldn't stand a chance at poker with me.""

Still grinning, he shuffled out of sight down the hall.

MacPherson sighed and went back to the table. ""Well, we'll have to get
along with just the four of us.""

""There's always the unseen guest,"" said Rothman, ""but you won't need to
deal him a hand. He already holds all the cards.""

Neill looked up. ""Stop hamming and sit down. Quit making like a maniac.
It's not even a good act.""

""Okay."" Rothman drew up a chair. ""Now what was said about limiting the
bets?""

""Why bother setting a limit?"" said Neill. ""We're not likely to mistake
each other for millionaires and we all got exactly the same pay when we
were on the Project. Unless your sick pay has had two or three zeros
tacked onto it, you're not going to be making any wild bets, and as for
the rest of us--""

""University professors are still being paid less than nightclub
dancers,"" said Avery. ""You're lucky to be out of the rat race,
Rothman. While we worry about how to pay the grocery bill, you can
relax, eating and sleeping at government expense. You never had it so
good.""

""Maybe you'd like to get yourselves committed and keep me company?""

MacPherson rapped the deck on the table. ""Stop that kind of talk. We
came here to play poker.""

""Did you?"" asked Rothman, grinning. ""Then why don't you deal?""

""Cut, Neill?"" said MacPherson. As he shot the slippery cards over the
table top, each flick of his thumb watched by Rothman's intent eyes,
he regretted this impulsive visit; it now seemed a gesture without
meaning. He wondered whether the others were as nervous as he was.

On the drive over from Los Angeles during the night, Neill had seemed
calm enough and even Avery, who had changed a lot during work on the
Project, had chatted with them unconstrainedly. It was hard to be
certain what other men were feeling, even when you had known them a
long time, but it could not be pleasant for any of them to be visiting
a former colleague who had been removed from the Project directly to a
sanitarium.

""Tell me something,"" said Rothman as he picked up his cards. ""Do you
still think I'm crazy?""

""Don't be an idiot,"" MacPherson snapped. ""Do you think we'd cut our
classes and drive nearly five hundred miles just to play poker with a
lunatic?""

""No,"" said Rothman. ""That's how I know. But why aren't you frank about
it? Why keep on pretending there wasn't a special reason for your
visit?""

       *       *       *       *       *

Neill was beating his foot against the table leg again and Avery's eyes
were hard and staring as he examined his cards.

""Who'll open?"" MacPherson asked. ""I can't.""

""I can,"" said Rothman. ""I'm betting one blue chip. Listen, Avery, why
won't you look at me? If you think I'm hamming, what do you call your
own act? How long are we going to go on kidding each other? They've
shut me up here, but that doesn't mean they've stopped me from logical
thinking. My three old friends from the Project don't turn up in the
middle of a Friday morning just to calm my fevered brain with a card
game.""

""What's wrong with poker?"" demanded MacPherson.

""Poker? Nothing. I know--It must be the test. Total conversion of
matter to energy. Not just a minute percentage any more--_total_
conversion. They've finished the set, haven't they? They're ready to
test. They're going to disintegrate Waaku, aren't they? It must be
today. Then this is the day the world ends. Tell me, when is zero hour?""

Neill's cards had slipped from his fingers and he stooped to the floor,
fumbling for them. Avery was bending one corner of a card, creasing it,
smoothing it out, and creasing it again. Nobody was going to answer,
MacPherson realized. They were leaving it up to him.

He spoke sharply. ""You're getting onto forbidden ground, Rothman. You
know we're not allowed to discuss the Project with you. We're allowed
to visit you only under the strictest promise not to speak of it at
all. You're certainly rational enough to understand what the therapists
have told you, that you'd get well easily enough if you'd stop
worrying. Forget about zero hour. Everything's going to be all right.""

Rothman turned to look out the window. ""Is it today?""

""How should we know? We're only innocent bystanders now, like you.
Remember, we all left the Project over six months ago, except Avery,
and last month they let him go.""

Neill had rearranged his cards now and he looked at them instead of
Rothman as he spoke. ""There's nothing to worry about. Your calculations
were wrong. The test is not going to get out of control--if and when
they make it. But they don't tell us things any more.""

""Since they fired you,"" said Rothman.

""That's right, since they fired us,"" Neill said. The creased corner of
a card suddenly broke off in his fingers.

""If you didn't believe in my calculations, why did you back me up? I
didn't ask you to. If you didn't believe in the danger, why didn't you
stay out of the argument and keep your jobs? It wasn't your fight. You
could have kept out of it--or attacked me, like Avery.""

""All we did was insist that even if you had made a mistake in your
calculations, that didn't necessarily prove you were crazy,"" said
Neill. ""We didn't know whether you were right or not. We couldn't argue
about the math. Avery tore that to pieces and the boys at Columbia and
Harvard backed him up. MacPherson and I aren't competent to check your
math. To us, you didn't seem any crazier than the people who sent you
here. But after you'd scared them silly, they had to do something to
stop your scaring other people.""

       *       *       *       *       *

He turned to pick up his cards again, but stopped at the sight of
Avery. Avery was standing and crumpling a card spasmodically, his lips
were moving without sound, and he was breathing rapidly.

""Look here,"" said MacPherson. ""You'd better change the subject. If
little Joe passes by the door and hears us talking about the Project,
he'll have our visiting privileges revoked before you can say nuclear
fission, and they'll stay revoked forever.""

""How long is forever?"" asked Rothman.

Avery threw down his cards and walked to the window. Through the bars,
there was nothing to be seen but the expanse of sand, glinting in the
morning sun, and a cactus plant casting a stubby shadow. He whirled to
face the others.

""Look, MacPherson,"" he burst out. ""I'm fed up with this game. Snookums
Rothman mustn't think about the Project any more, so we mustn't say the
naughty word. But we were all in it together at the beginning and there
was a while when we were all every bit as scared as he was. Why not
tell him we came this morning in case--just in case--he'd heard about
the test and was worrying? What's the harm in telling him what the
whole university knows? That zero hour is today, this morning, now!""

""Shut up, you fool!"" said MacPherson.

But Rothman glanced at his cards again, then looked up. ""When does it
begin? What time is it now?""

""Don't answer!"" shouted MacPherson. ""Are you trying to knock him off
balance again?""

""I will answer!"" said Avery. ""I'm going to tell him. He scared us silly
with his calculations; now let us scare him with some cold facts. It'll
do him good. Maybe when the test is over, if he finds--I mean _when_ he
finds--he was wrong, he'll be cured.""

""Yes, and maybe he'll really be crazy.""

Grabbing Avery fiercely by the arm, MacPherson tried to drag him to the
door, but Avery broke away.

""Listen, Rothman!"" Avery's breath was coming quick and shallow. ""Today
is the day! Zero hour is eleven o'clock this morning!""

       *       *       *       *       *

MacPherson sagged. No one spoke or moved as they all watched Rothman.

At last Rothman sighed, once. ""What time is it now?""

From the door came a scratching sound. MacPherson turned to see Joe,
grinning at them through the steel lattice.

""How's things?"" Joe wanted to know. ""Thought I heard a commotion in
here. Doc Rothman's not acting up, I hope?""

""Everything's under control, Joe,"" MacPherson assured him. ""Just having
a friendly game.""

""Don't cheat while they're watching you,"" said Joe, and his face
disappeared.

""Well, the murder's out,"" said MacPherson.

""No use kidding you any longer,"" Neill said, fanning his cards.
""Eleven o'clock this morning. Six o'clock tomorrow morning, Waaku time.
But it's just another test. Nothing's going to happen.""

Avery took off his glasses and began to polish the lenses. ""Any idea
of a possible chain reaction is ridiculous. As a matter of fact, I
recently spent a full week checking the math again myself, so I know.
But we knew how you felt about it, Rothman, and we didn't want you to
be worrying here all alone, in case you'd found out. That's why we
came.""

Rothman was looking out the window. He did not answer. Slowly
MacPherson went back to his chair and picked up his cards. ""And now how
about playing some poker? Rothman, you opened for a blue. What about
you, Neill?""

""I'm staying,"" said Neill, shoving in a chip. ""Always was a gambler.
I'm going to stay till the cows come home.""

""What time is it?"" Rothman asked. ""I haven't got a wristwatch. They
think I might break the crystal and cut my throat.""

MacPherson slammed down his cards and jerked his watch from his pocket.
""What does it matter what time it is? Why couldn't they give you a
watch with a plastic crystal? If you have to know, it's eleven-forty.""

""And thirteen seconds,"" added Neill.

""Then it's already started,"" said Rothman.

       *       *       *       *       *

He leaned his head against the back of his chair and closed his eyes.
""It's on its way now. There's somewhat more than a third of the
Earth between us and Waaku--the place where Waaku was, I mean. The
disintegration wave is moving slowly. The seismic wave of an earthquake
would get here in about fifty minutes, more or less. But the shock wave
from Waaku, traveling somewhere around five thousand miles an hour,
will need about an hour and seventeen minutes, plus or minus a minute
or so. That means it will reach us in about thirty-seven minutes from
now, and the disintegration wave is following close behind. Well, nice
to have known you, fellows. Anyone want to check my math?""

He waved toward the desk behind him, piled high with manuscript and a
sprawling heap of books on which rested a slide-rule.

""Calm down,"" said MacPherson. ""Nothing is going to happen. Damn you,
Avery! Are you proud of what you accomplished?""

Avery glared. ""It'll do him good! He's got to learn to face reality,
like the rest of us. In a little more than half an hour, the test will
be finished. The world will still be here. Rothman will have to admit
his equations were wrong--and then he'll be cured.""

Rothman leaned forward. ""Or contrariwise, Rothman will _not_ have to
admit he was wrong and Rothman will _not_ be cured! If I made a mistake
in my math, why couldn't anybody put his finger on it? I'm not so crazy
that I wouldn't be able to see an error in calculus when it was pointed
out to me. If you're sure my calculations are wrong, why do you look so
frightened?""

""Do we have to go over all that again?"" said MacPherson. ""The boys
at Columbia told you where the mistake was. It's where you inverted
that twelve-by-twelve matrix. Didn't you bother to check the inverted
matrix?""

""The same old tale."" Rothman picked up his cards. ""No mathematician
will ever admit that another mathematician could invent a method beyond
his comprehension. Still harping on an error in my inverted matrix.
What time is it now?""

""There's no doubt that your calculations are wrong,"" said Neill, ""but
I still don't see why we have to insist on proving it the hard way.
With bombs, why do we need to fool around with the total disintegration
of matter? Sure, I know the new model releases a googol times the
energy you get out of uranium fission, but who cares? There's plenty of
uranium for our needs.""

""The trouble with uranium is that it doesn't make a big enough bang,""
said MacPherson. ""People aren't impressed by it any more. The same
goes for plutonium, even for lithium, at least for any size bomb we
can make. The idea is to show the world something so convincing that
they'll never even think of a war again. When they see every island in
the Waaku chain wiped off the map, they'll get the point.""

       *       *       *       *       *

Avery creased another card and cleared his throat. ""_Did_ you check the
inverted twelve-by-twelve, Rothman?""

""I suppose you think I forgot to. Have _you_ checked it?""

""Yes, I have. I may not know much math, but I did check it.""

""Even after the Columbia boys said it was nonsense? Well, does it come
out right?""

""No, it doesn't! You multiply the inverted matrix by the original and
you not only don't get zeros for all elements outside the diagonal,
you get a haphazard assortment of ones and twos. Worse still, every
element in the diagonal comes out equal to zero. The product of the two
matrices is about as different from the identity matrix as anything
could be. You're one of our most brilliant mathematicians--how could
you manage to make so many mistakes in one set of calculations?""

""Did I tell you that was an inverted matrix? Maybe, for this problem,
you need something a little more advanced than algebra. Anyhow, if my
math is all wrong, why did your first report okay it?""

""What do you mean, my first report?""

""The one you sent to Prexy. The one you later called in and burned.
Except Prexy showed it to me and I photostated it. Here."" Rothman
reached into the pile of papers on his desk and drew out a little
envelope. It contained photographic prints. He held one before Avery's
glasses. ""Does that look familiar?""

Avery drew his hand across his forehead, but did not reply.

""Is that true, Avery?"" asked MacPherson. ""Did you make a report okaying
Rothman's calculations and then withdraw it?""

""Well, what if I did? The report didn't seem to make me much more
popular than Rothman was. What if some very influential people in
Government explained to Prexy, and he explained to me, just how
unpopular that first report might make me? Or suppose they didn't.
Maybe I simply didn't find the mistakes in the math until later."" Avery
kept looking at his cards as he spoke.

""Oh, great,"" said MacPherson. ""Rothman gets put away here, Neill and
I lose our jobs, and there's hell to pay in Washington, all because
Avery says Rothman's math is full of holes. Now it turns out he wasn't
sure and maybe was pressured into it. Grand. Between a screwball and a
skunk, I'll choose the screwball. Maybe if Avery had stuck to his guns,
there wouldn't have been any test.""

       *       *       *       *       *

""It doesn't matter,"" said Rothman. ""Avery was probably warned to mend
his ways. I was. Or maybe he couldn't face the truth. I'm sure he's
been much happier, the last few months, believing I'm crazy. Anyway,
I don't blame him any more. Maybe my math will soon speak for itself.
For your benefit--"" he turned to Avery--""I may point out that the
errors you said you found affect only the _velocity_ of the wave of
disintegration. So what if that isn't quite right? The proof that the
reaction will be self-sustaining is independent of that.""

Avery was white with rage. ""The proof, as you called it, that the
reaction will be self-sustaining and will consume the entire substance
of the Earth doesn't make sense, either. You used D as an operator
where it should have been a constant. That's what finally made them
certain that you were insane.""

There was a rap at the door and Joe poked his head in. ""Lunch,
Professors! Twelve o'clock, high noon, like they say. How about some
turkey sandwiches?""

MacPherson began to sweat; the thought of food made him feel sick.

Was it possible, he wondered, that in spite of everything, he was not
quite sure? He looked at Neill and Avery, but they had turned their
heads away.

""We won't bother with lunch, Joe,"" said Rothman.

""Must be a pretty good game if you won't even knock off to eat,"" said
Joe. ""Well, will you at least mark your menu for tomorrow?""

""For tomorrow? Tomorrow isn't going to come, you know.""

""Nuts,"" muttered Joe as he closed and locked the door. ""Pure nuts.""

Avery cleared his throat, and his voice was thin. ""Look here, Rothman!
If the Universe were composed of matter as unstable as you claim,
it would have ceased to exist long ago. Somewhere, somehow, in the
infinity of chance events since the creation of the Earth, something
would have occurred to start the self-sustaining chain reaction, and
all matter would have been annihilated.""

""Are you trying to prove something to yourself?"" asked Rothman. ""Surely
you don't equate infinity with a mere four billion years. That's
a finite time--long enough for the more dangerous radioactives to
disappear completely, of course, but not long enough for all possible
chance events to have taken place. Anyway, I never have asserted that
the reaction would reach from Earth to the other planets, or even to
the Moon. The Universe, including the Solar System, will still go on.
But our old Earth is going up like a pile of magnesium powder mixed
with potassium chlorate when you drop a lighted match on it.""

       *       *       *       *       *

Avery wiped his forehead. ""I don't know why I keep arguing with
a lunatic. But you know yourself that the value you give for the
integration constant in those equations is a pure guess, only you
spend ten pages of doubletalk trying to hide that fact. If the constant
is the one you give, why, sure, then you get a chain reaction. But
you made it up! Who ever heard of a constant of that magnitude in the
solution of an ordinary differential equation?""

""That's one criticism of my work the Harvard and Columbia boys never
mentioned.""

""Okay, then I mention it. You're crazy!""

""Are you sure?""

""Positive!""

""Then why can't you forget the approach of zero hour? I'll tell you
why and you aren't even making a good show of hiding it. You know
that, compared to mine, your knowledge of mathematics is about on a
level with that of a college sophomore. Deep down, you know that my
calculations were correct. You are convinced--_convinced_--that the
bombing of Waaku has already started a chain reaction. And that about
seventeen minutes past twelve, around eight minutes from now, the shock
wave will reach us, and then the wave of disintegration. Look out of
the window! See that cactus in the sand, with its little yellow flower?
It will be annihilated. All that desert will go, too--every pebble,
every grain of sand. Everything you see, and you yourself, will be
disintegrated, transformed into energy!""

Suddenly he relaxed into a grin and softened his voice. ""I thought we
were playing poker. We're waiting for you to bet. Why don't you at
least look at your cards?""

Avery opened his mouth, then closed it, and picked up his hand,
riffling the five cards.

""I'm staying,"" he said. ""Here's your blue and I raise you a blue.""

Slowly the others picked up their hands and stared at the cards.
MacPherson scarcely looked at his as he spoke.

""I'm staying."" He picked up the deck. ""Cards, gentlemen?""

Rothman shook his head. ""I'll play these.""

Neill took two. ""I like to hold a kicker,"" he explained.

Avery and MacPherson drew three.

""I opened,"" said Rothman, ""and I'll bet five blue chips.""

""See you and raise you a blue,"" Neill said.

""I'll string along,"" said Avery.

MacPherson threw his hand in. ""I'll let you guys fight it out.""

       *       *       *       *       *

They all looked at Rothman, who was studying his cards.

""I'll see you,"" he began, and paused. Then he shoved all of his chips
into the pot. ""I'll see you and raise you a hundred blue chips.""

""Damn it Rothman!"" MacPherson protested. ""I know we agreed on no
limit, but if you go on playing like this, you'll lose more than you
can afford.""

""I've already lost everything,"" said Rothman, ""and so have you. Don't
you know what time it is? In a few minutes, none of you will be around
to try to collect. What time is it now?""

Avery reached for his watch, then stopped.

Rothman turned his head. ""What's that?""

Nobody moved.

A noise like the roar of a swift freight train rushed into the
room, rattling the windows. The walls shook, the floor trembled, the
slide-rule slid off the pile of books and clattered to the floor.

They jumped to their feet and Avery ran to the window, clutching at the
bars.

""Not yet,"" said Rothman calmly. ""The cactus plant will still be there,
casting its little shadow. You might as well sit down and finish the
game. That was only the shock wave. Have you forgotten that it is
transmitted through the Earth faster than the wave of disintegration?
We still have a few minutes left. Isn't anybody going to see my bet?""

Avery lurched to the desk, grabbed a remnant of torn paper and
scribbled on it

""I'll see you,"" he yelled, ""and raise you a hundred and twenty-five
billion blues!""

MacPherson walked to the window. ""Look at the sky. This is it.""

They all jammed against his back, trying to see the horizon, waiting.
Avery dropped the scrap of paper and covered his eyes.

""What is there to see?"" Neill whispered.

""I thought--there was a flash...."" MacPherson's voice trailed off, and
he rubbed his eyes.

""But I didn't see anything,"" said Neill. ""There's nothing to see.""

       *       *       *       *       *

A minute went by. The desert remained calm, the blue sky was unmarked
by even a cloud, the air was still.

A second minute went by.

Neill drew out his watch, looked wonderingly at the steady march of
the second hand. Then he turned and stumbled into the lavatory. They
could hear his dry heaves.

Rothman's eyes wavered from MacPherson to Avery, and back to
MacPherson, and he sighed.

""Looks as if I was wrong, gentlemen,"" he said. ""Maybe I am crazy, after
all. I wonder if that integration constant could have been wrong."" He
reached down to the floor to pick up the fallen slide-rule, sat down
and drew a pad of paper toward him.

MacPherson leaned against the window, too weak to move. He saw Avery
take his hands away from his eyes. He could hear the chattering of
Avery's teeth, could hear them click as he clamped them together,
trying to control his lips. It seemed a long time before Avery managed
to speak.

""_You!_"" cried Avery. He lunged forward, grabbed Rothman by the
shoulder and jerked him to his feet. ""This--will teach you--not to
make--mistakes--""

He smashed his fist into Rothman's face.

Still MacPherson could not move, could not even shout. He could only
listen to Avery.

""And this will teach you--not to set up matrices--that don't
multiply--that burn up--the world--""

Again Avery struck and knocked Rothman to the floor.

Breaking through his paralysis, MacPherson clutched Avery by the
shoulder, but Avery kicked at the man on the floor, again and again.

""Avery!"" shouted MacPherson. ""Snap out of it, man! It's all over! The
test is finished. We're still here. Rothman was wrong, just as we
always knew he was!""

But Avery was on his knees, pounding Rothman with both fists, sobbing
out meaningless words, oblivious to the shouts outside and to
MacPherson's tugging.

The door burst open and Joe rushed in, followed by two other attendants.

""What goes on?"" After a glance at Avery's contorted face, Joe grabbed
for his legs. ""Send for the doc, boys. We're going to need help.""

       *       *       *       *       *

One of the men ran down the corridor while Joe and the others succeeded
in pulling Avery away from Rothman, who struggled to his feet. A doctor
came in with a loaded hypodermic. He gave Avery an injection in the arm.

""Go easy there,"" said MacPherson. ""He'll be all right in a few minutes.
He's had a shock, that's all.""

""Shock,"" Avery mumbled.

MacPherson gripped Avery's arm. ""Try to relax, man. It's finished. We
never believed in it, of course. But I'll admit it's a relief, even to
me, to be _sure_ there was no danger of a chain reaction at all.""

Suddenly he felt cold.

There was no understanding in Avery's eyes. He slumped to the floor.

""Do you think he'll be all right when he comes out from under the
drug?"" asked MacPherson.

""I can't say,"" said the doctor. ""I only saw him a few minutes, when
you came here this morning. I thought at the time he was pretty
disturbed. Much more than Rothman here. Next week, I think, we're going
to send Rothman home.""

Rothman wiped the blood off his chin and grinned weakly. ""You don't
mean that, Doc. I used the wrong integration constant in a little
calculation. I must be crazy.""

 CHAPTER I.
 DE JURE.

“I really feel quite guilty,” said the Master of St Saviour’s
College to the distinguished foreigner whom he was escorting to the
Senate House. “Your time in Cambridge is so short that every moment
must be needed for your work.”

“Pray do not reproach yourself, sir,” replied Professor Panagiotis,
with the deliberate precision of one who has learned English from
books. “What greater honour could be afforded me than permission to
observe the contests of your youthful heroes for the rewards of poetry
and oratory?”

“You mustn’t expect too much,” said the Master, with some anxiety;
“though if it had been merely the usual recitation of prize exercises,
I should have left you in peace in the Library. But the subject of the
English Poem has such a close connection with that of your great
book--not, of course, that it was intentionally chosen; merely a
coincidence,” he added conscientiously--“that I felt you ought to be
present.”

“I am entirely agreed with you,” responded the author of the famous
German work on the fall of the Eastern Empire, wondering why his host
was so determined not to let him see a compliment where none was
meant. “The subject, then, is historical?”

“The Fall of Czarigrad,” replied the Master, “and the medal has come
to a St Saviour’s man, which has not happened for many years. I
understand that he studied your book very carefully before writing his
poem, and that is my reason for dragging you here.”

It was in the Professor’s mind to wish that his book had not been
studied, as he sat in the Senate House and heard various agitated
young men, their faces vying sometimes with the white of the M.A.
hoods and sometimes with the Doctors’ scarlet, declaim compositions in
various languages, with all the grace and dignity to be expected from
extreme nervousness subject to the perpetual encouragement of
well-meaning friends. Latin the Professor despised, and the Cambridge
Greek, from the difference of pronunciation, he scarcely recognised as
his own language, but the English Poem roused in him a certain amount
of interest, though he felt a mighty longing to relieve the author of
the task of reciting it. The medallist was fortunate in being pale,
and not red, for Professor Panagiotis considered blushing a purely
feminine exercise, but he shared with his fellows the English
incapacity for letting himself go. In his most thrilling passages the
note of shamed self-consciousness was clearly audible, and he endured
the applause accorded him with a stolid resignation that seemed to
inquire why he could not be allowed to perform a distasteful duty in
peace. This was the more irritating to Professor Panagiotis because
the poem, whenever he could catch the words, struck him as remarkable.
The author had chosen as his theme the final day in the long struggle
of the Cross against the Crescent, when the Moslem tide overflowed at
last the grand bulwark of Christendom, and the Emperor John Theophanis
fell fighting as a common soldier in the breach. The recital was
placed in the mouth of the Emperor, and the description of the night’s
vigil, the dawn of the fatal day, the fanatic fury of the assault, the
desertion of the Christian cause by its allies, and the last desperate
fight, into which Theophanis was to hurl himself, determined to
perish, impressed the listener with a curious sense of realism. He had
lived for months and years among the records of these scenes, but he
could not have described them with the sure hand of this
undergraduate. The tale was plain and unvarnished, the telling crude
and bald, but as the fragmentary lines, unassisted by any rhetorical
graces in the reciter, reached the hearer, he felt such a thrill as
the unadorned narrative of an eyewitness might produce. The young man
must be a poet of quite unusual power, and Professor Panagiotis forgot
the manuscripts awaiting him at the Library in the determination to
cultivate his acquaintance.

“But, my dear friend, you have a genius there!” he cried, when the
Master rejoined him at the close of the ceremony. “Who is this poet of
yours, whose name I could not hear on account of the noise of the
envious relatives of his fellow-students?”

An irrepressible smile crossed the Master’s face, but he answered with
all gravity. “Teffany--Maurice Teffany--a third-year man. He goes down
next week, after he has taken his degree.”

“Teffany! _Himmel und Erde_, is it possible?” cried the Professor.
“And yet I might have known. The thing is the most extraordinary
coincidence! Pardon me,” as his host looked at him in surprise, “but I
have associations with the name. I am all interest. He is the pride of
the college, this young man?”

“Not at all,” said the Master, laughing. “In fact, it’s a curious
case. Teffany has always been rather a puzzle to me. He is not what
you would call a popular man, but he has exercised a good deal of
influence in a quiet way. I must confess I found him a little
disappointing, especially in comparison with his sister, a very clever
girl. She used to attend my lectures with other Girtham students, and
did extremely good work for me, showing a distinct capacity for
original research. Teffany worked well, but in a plodding, uninspired
sort of way. I was always irritated by the feeling that we had never
yet hit on his special line.”

“But now--since this poem--you can have no doubt?” asked Professor
Panagiotis quickly.

The Master shook his head. “I am still doubtful,” he said. “I asked
his tutor to find out whether he had done anything else in the
poetical line--one would expect reams of amateur verse, you know--but
there was not a scrap. He had never written verses before, and he
seems to have no wish to do it again.”

“The young man interests me,” said the Professor. “His name alone----”
he stopped abruptly, as though he had changed his mind. “Quite
independently of his name, I mean.”

“Ah, of course, his subject would appeal to you,” said the Master
unsuspiciously. “You would like to meet him, perhaps? I will invite
him to dine with us to-night. He has reflected honour on the college,
and I shall be glad to mark my sense of it.”

At dinner that evening Professor Panagiotis scanned his neighbour
narrowly whenever he found an opportunity. To him, as to the Master,
the young man was a disappointment. He was extraordinarily ordinary.
Neither tall nor short, neither dark nor fair, neither foppish nor
careless, neither talkative nor silent, he seemed in no way
distinguished or distinguishable. It was only on comparing him with
the other guests that the Professor arrived at a conclusion which gave
him something of a shock. There was a strength and decision about the
jaw and chin which did not amount to obstinacy, but suggested that the
owner might be difficult to turn aside, and a steady calmness about
the eyes which bespoke an indisposition to be hurried.

“The worst type in the world to manage!” was the Professor’s inward
groan. “I must do what I can to gain his confidence, but I foresee it
will be necessary to approach him through the brilliant sister.”

Presently Maurice Teffany found himself addressed by the distinguished
guest, the great Greek man of letters who had made his German
university famous all over the world. His previous silence, coupled
with his keen glances, had made him appear somewhat formidable, but he
now talked pleasantly enough, and the young man became confidential on
the subject of the prize poem, which he seemed to his questioner to
regard as a huge joke.

“It’s an utter fraud, my getting the medal,” he said. “It ought to
have gone to my sister--or perhaps to you, sir. My sister was awfully
keen on my trying for it, because there were a lot of old books about
Czarigrad which we were very fond of as children, but I hadn’t the
slightest idea of it. Then this last winter I sprained my ankle badly
at the very beginning of the vac.--only about six weeks before the
poems had to be sent in--and couldn’t get out, and she gave me no
peace. She had your book, and she translated all the most thrilling
bits and read them to me, and then--well, it got hold of me somehow,
and I seemed to know all about it. So I just wrote it down, and she
criticised it, and copied it out for me, and it got the medal! The
Master says it’s brutal and rugged and everything that a poem ought
not to be, but that there’s _vision_ in it--whatever he may mean by
that.”

“And you agree with him?”

“Oh, I suppose so. Anyhow, he’s sure to know the right thing to say.
You see, sir, I don’t feel that I wrote it. It just came--as if I had
been there and seen it. My sister and I always call it ‘The Finest
Story in the World’ between ourselves--but perhaps you don’t know
Kipling?”

“I fear not, if you allude to some English writer on the subject of
reincarnation. But I am going to ask you a rude question on a point of
psychology. Is it possible that the poem was actually your sister’s
composition, but that she impressed it upon your mind, so that you
accepted and wrote it as your own?”

Young Teffany considered the matter gravely, and then laughed. “Rather
not!” he said. “Zoe’s an awfully clever girl, and writes a good bit,
but she has never dabbled in poetry any more than me. She was just as
much surprised at the way the thing turned out as I was. And as to
making her poem pass into my mind without my knowing it--why, she
couldn’t do it. I’m as certain of that as I am of anything, though I
think a lot of her--but of course I don’t tell her so.”

“My dear sir, you have already grasped one of the main secrets of the
management of the female sex,” said the Professor sententiously. “But
may I suggest a variation of your reincarnation theory? I am at
present engaged in following up my larger work by tracing the
dispersal of the Greeks who survived the fall of Czarigrad, and it
occurs to me that your family may be descended from one of them.”

He scanned his companion’s face closely, as though to discover whether
the idea was new to him, but the young man only laughed. “A case of
inherited memory? I’m afraid it’s no go, sir. There’s nothing in the
least Greek about us.”

“Four centuries of English marriages would go far to obliterate racial
traits,” was the dry reply. “Your Christian name is Greek, at any
rate.”

“All our names are. It’s a kind of tradition in the family. My father
was Theodore, and his father and grandfather were both Constantine.
However far back you go, it’s always Basil and Gregory and so on for
the men, and Dorothea and Katharine and names of that sort for the
women.”

“That is very curious,” with repressed eagerness. “And you are sure
there is no tradition of a Greek ancestry?”

“None that I know of. But my sister would be a better person to ask.
She’s had flu., you know, with a touch of bronchitis, or else she’d
have been here to-day, and she said she was going to forget her
sorrows in rummaging among the family papers. There are a few at home,
and some at the lawyer’s. But really, I’m afraid there’s not much to
find out. We have only been settled at our present place for sixty or
seventy years--horribly new, you see.”

“Then where was your family established before that?” The Professor
leaned forward anxiously.

“Oh, somewhere in the wilds of Cornwall. My grandfather could just
remember the old place. My sister and I talk sometimes of making a
pilgrimage down there--seeking the cradle of our race, you know--but I
believe it’s only a farmhouse now.”

“The cradle of your race!” with measureless contempt. “My dear Mr
Teffany”--the Professor modified the eagerness of his tone as his
hearer looked at him in astonishment--“I must see those papers--any
family relics you may possess. What this identification, if it is
established, may mean to me--to you--I hardly dare think. I--I had
traced the family of which I am in search as far as Penteffan on the
Cornish coast, and there all sign of them was lost. This is like new
life to me. You will not refuse your help?”

“Of course, we shall be glad to do anything we can,” was the reply,
given without effusion. “Penteffan was the name of my
great-grandfather’s place, certainly. We have a picture of it--‘The
Seat of Constantine Teffany, Esq.’ Will you come down with me next
week, and look over the papers with my sister--if you are not afraid
of the flu.?”

“No, no; I have paid toll to the devil,” replied the Professor
hurriedly. His hearer interpreted the somewhat startling assertion
correctly as referring to the influenza-fiend, and they proceeded to
discuss ways and means. It was settled at last that Maurice should go
home the next week, as he had intended, and obtain the papers of which
his lawyer had charge, and that the Professor, who was to receive an
honorary degree from the University, should follow as soon as
possible, when they would go through the documents together.

 * * * * * * *

“Maurice, an awful blow!” Zoe Teffany sprang up to meet her brother as
he put his head in at the door of the library where she was at work.
“I believe our name is really Smith!”

“That’s cheerful. What makes you think so?”

“Why, I was tidying the top shelves of the bookcases, and I found a
lot of grandpapa’s old schoolbooks, and every one of them had ‘C.
Smith’ or ‘Constantine Smith’ inside. Then I remembered those old
letters of great-grandmamma’s--about buying this place, you know--and
when I looked at them they were all addressed to ‘Mrs Smith.’ The
address was written in the middle of one side of the paper, in the old
way--there were no envelopes--and I had not noticed it when I saw them
before.”

“What a frightful sell for Professor Panagiotis!” chuckled Maurice.
“Shall we wire, and put the old fellow out of his misery?”

“Oh no, no! Why, it mayn’t be true; we’ll hope it isn’t. I have been
looking at everything else I can think of, to try and be certain one
way or the other, and I can only find the name Smith just when
grandpapa was a boy. His parents were Teffany before he was born, and
we know he was Teffany when we knew him. What can it mean?”

“Well, since he was a small boy at school when he called himself
Smith, it can hardly mean that he had done something and was in
hiding. There’s one piece of comfort for you, at any rate. But I tell
you what, I’ll ask old Lake, when I ride over to-morrow to get the
papers. He ought to know, if any one does.”

“Oh, do; and be sure and hurry back. I shall be dying to know. I hope
there’s some romantic reason, at any rate. Smith is such a terribly
unromantic name. Couldn’t you go to-day?”

“Scarcely, since my appointment with Lake is for to-morrow.”

“Oh, how prosaic you are--talking of appointments, when you ought to
saddle your fleetest steed and spur him headlong over hill and dale to
discover the truth!”

“Ah, I’m not a budding novelist, you know.”

“No, only a full-blown tragic poet.” Zoe raised her voice as Maurice
beat a hasty retreat. The varying literary fortunes of the two
afforded endless opportunity for mutual chaff, but whereas Zoe gloried
in her abortive efforts at fiction, on the ground that they were too
good for any publisher to accept, Maurice was inclined to be ashamed
of his success. The romantic was Zoe’s province, not his, and the only
excitement he felt over her momentous discovery was due to the
possible disappointment in store for Professor Panagiotis, for whom he
had conceived a certain distrust, due to his mysterious hints and
half-revelations. There was no enthusiasm, therefore, in his tone when
he entered the library on the following afternoon.

“Well,” he said, “our name is Teffany all right. I have interviewed
old Lake, and you may sleep in peace. There was a reason for the Smith
business, and I suppose you would call it romantic. I call it
cracked.”

“Oh, do tell me!” cried Zoe. “Was it a feud?”

“Nobody knows. Lake could only tell me what his father told him, and
what they guessed. His father had just gone into the office when our
great-grandmother and her little boy arrived in the neighbourhood
about seventy years ago. She had excellent bankers’ references, and
began to negotiate for the purchase of this place. She told them that
she was left sole guardian of her son, and that she had been obliged
to remove from her former part of the country on account of grave
dangers threatening his life. For safety’s sake, they would be known
for the present by the name of Smith. She was a handsome woman, and
the Lakes thought there must be some revengeful discarded lover in the
case. She bought this place and lived here unmolested, and when her
son was twenty-one, he resumed the name of Teffany, which the lawyers
heard then for the first time. At the same time, he sold Penteffan,
which had been managed by a London firm. He would have liked to go
back there, but his mother objected so vehemently that he humoured
her, especially since the old house had been allowed to fall into
decay. The Lakes could never discover anything to account for her
horror of the place, except that the people remembered two foreigners
coming and making inquiries about the family soon after she left.
That’s absolutely all they know.”

“Oh, Maurice, how thrilling!” cried Zoe, drawing a long breath. “Do
you think the house was haunted? or--no, I am sure it was smugglers.
Perhaps she had betrayed them to the revenue officers, and they meant
to kidnap her child in revenge. I wonder if there’s anything about it
in the papers you have brought. Shall we look at them now?”

“No, nonsense! Leave them till the Professor comes. Let’s go and see
how the new croquet-lawn is getting on.”

The Professor arrived the next day, casting keen, curious glances
about him. The sober stateliness of the house, the old family
servants, the unobtrusive perfection of every detail indoors and out,
and the easy kindliness of the young master and mistress--all were, so
to speak, noted in his memory and labelled for reference. He remarked
also Zoe’s unconcealed eagerness for the hour when the family papers
were to be examined, and the tolerant resignation with which Maurice
awaited it. He would find the motive force in the sister, the staying
power in the brother, he assured himself again.

“This is what will interest you most, I expect,” said Maurice, when
they had retired to the library after dinner, unrolling a long
parchment scroll as he spoke. “It is our family tree, properly drawn
out.”

Professor Panagiotis peered at the document with a hungry look. “You
are right,” he said; “it is priceless. Your family has dwindled
strangely, Mr Teffany. I cannot tell you how many collateral branches
I have followed up, only to find that they died out, while the direct
line was in existence unknown to me.”

“Yes, my sister and I are the sole representatives of the name, as far
as this pedigree shows,” said Maurice.

“Exactly--so far as this pedigree shows,” agreed the guest, comparing
the document with the entries in a note-book which he had brought with
him.

“Oh, Maurice, look!” cried Zoe. “Isn’t it funny? Do you see that the
beginning of the parchment is sealed down? There must be some secret
charge, or something of that sort, inside.”

“Lake said that our grandfather sealed it in his presence,” returned
Maurice. “But it must have been sealed a good many times before, to
judge by all the old seals.”

“Oh dear, I hoped it would reveal the mystery!” sighed Zoe. The
Professor looked up sharply.

“My sister gave us a great fright two days ago,” explained Maurice.
“It appears that my grandfather and his mother adopted the name of
Smith for about fifteen years after they moved here from Penteffan.”

 “_This is what will interest you most, I expect_,” _said Maurice, ...
 unrolling a long parchment scroll as he spoke._]

“Indeed?” with growing excitement. “This gives me my last link,
explains the one fact for which I could not account--the sudden and
absolute disappearance of the Teffanys from Penteffan seventy-two
years ago. I could find no record of the death of the widow of the
last proprietor and her infant son, and yet I could not succeed in
tracing them.”

“Then you know who the foreigners were who made inquiries?” “Then you
can explain why she called herself Smith?” burst from Maurice and Zoe
simultaneously.

“I can explain it now. The foreigners were delegates from the Greek
National Assembly, seeking a leader whose very name would rally round
him the contentious factions that disgraced the cause of liberty, each
fighting for its own hand. The widowed Mrs Teffany, herself the
daughter of an Englishman who had fallen in the cause of Greece, had
too little faith in that cause to devote her son to it, and removed
him effectually out of sight.”

“But why should they want a little boy of five, who couldn’t even
fight?” cried Zoe. “It wasn’t as if he was a king.”

“He would have been proclaimed king, doubtless. It was not the person,
so much as the name, that was of importance.”

“But why the name? Is there something we don’t know? Is it here, under
these seals?”

“Possibly.” The Professor cast a side glance at Maurice. “Mr Teffany
desires me to continue?”

“Yes, yes!” cried Zoe, as Maurice nodded. “Tell us, quick!”

She seized the parchment, but the Professor removed it from her hands.
“It is your brother’s right,” he said. “He is the head of the house.
You observe that the pedigree goes back to Alexius Teffany, who
settled in Cornwall in the sixteenth century. Now break the seals,
sir, if you please. You observe that Alexius was the son of John, who
was the son of Manuel, who was the son of Basil----”

“Who was the son of John Theophanis, Roman Emperor, who died
gloriously on the walls of Czarigrad!” shrieked Zoe. “Oh, Maurice,
isn’t it splendid?”

“That is not all,” said Professor Panagiotis. “You, Maurice Teffany,
are at this moment the rightful Emperor of the East.”




 CHAPTER II.
 OF THE STOCK OF THE EMPERORS.

“Oh, Maurice!” gasped Zoe, almost voiceless in her excitement.

“Well,” said Maurice, perhaps with greater carelessness than he felt,
“it sounds very nice, but plenty of people are the rightful something
or other, and it makes no difference to practical politics. Besides,
there’s almost certain to be some flaw.”

“Flaw!” cried the Professor, “no flaw is possible. Here is the table
of your descent, as kept by your family, agreeing exactly with that
which I have compiled from old local histories and the registers and
monuments at Penteffan. Every member of the family in direct descent
is buried there, except one.”

“And there the chain breaks, I suppose?” said Maurice.

“By no means, sir. The missing Nicholas is buried in Westminster
Abbey. Doubtless he died when on a visit to London.”

“Westminster Abbey!” breathed Zoe softly. “Think of having a relation
buried there, and not knowing it!”

“This will interest you,” said the Professor, passing her a paper. It
was the copy of a seventeenth-century entry in a marriage register,
and she read the name of the bride aloud.

“‘_Eugenia Theophanes, de stirpe imperatorum_.’ Oh, and that----”

“That is what you are,” said the Professor, with a bow.

“_Zoe Theophanes, de stirpe imperatorum_,” she murmured under her
breath.

“Don’t be ecstatic, Zoe,” said Maurice sharply. “What difference can
it make, our knowing this? It’s quite clear that our grandfather knew
it, and it made no difference to him.”

“Yes, he knew it,” agreed Professor Panagiotis, glancing from the
pedigree on the table to the decorations of the room, in which the
family crest, a golden eagle with its feet resting on two gates, was
unobtrusively repeated again and again. Zoe had been her grandfather’s
assistant in designing the frieze and the carvings of the high
mantelshelf, little guessing the meaning attaching to them in the old
man’s mind, or that the two gates were those of Rome and of Czarigrad.

“He spent his life quietly here, doing his duty to his tenants,”
persisted Maurice, as though combating something that had been said.

“He did,” responded the Professor; “but when he reached manhood, and
learned for the first time of his lofty ancestry, the present kingdom
of Morea had long been established under a German prince. In the
crisis of 1862, his countrymen, ignorant of his existence, made no
attempt to summon him to their head, and a constitutional
reticence--resembling, shall I say, that of his grandson?--withheld
him from putting himself forward, so that the crown passed without
opposition to the present Cimbrian ruler.”

“I presume you are not suggesting that I should deprive King William
of Morea of his throne?” asked Maurice, with an angry laugh.

“No,” said the Professor emphatically. “The Morean kingdom, grievously
as it has disappointed the hopes fixed upon it, may be disregarded
until the day comes for it to take its place among the federal States
of the revived Empire. It is Unredeemed Greece which claims your
attention--the only portion of Europe still groaning under the Roumi
yoke.”

“I see; you are an Emathian agitator,” was the chilling answer.

“I am and I am not,” replied the Professor. “I am an Emathian Greek,
cherishing warm hopes of the deliverance of my country; but I have
nothing in common with those bands of miscreants which, financed and
directed by interested committees in Thracia and Dardania, have
brought the name of Emathia into discredit throughout Europe by their
wholesale assassinations. I hold them in the utmost detestation. Even
the Roumis are less to be feared.”

“No connection with any one else in the same line of business,”
murmured Maurice. “Surely,” he observed aloud, “you would do better if
you could unite into one body all who had the same object in view?
Then you could moderate the Balkan passion for assassination, and they
would bring you a welcome accession of numbers and money.”

Professor Panagiotis laughed bitterly. “Your words prove that you
share the usual English ignorance of the state of affairs in Emathia,”
he said. “To the schismatic Thracians and Dardanians, an Orthodox
Christian is equally hateful with a Roumi, and the same treatment is
meted out to him.”

“A pleasant prospect for the future!” said Maurice. The Professor
turned upon him almost savagely.

“Joke, jest, mock, Mr Teffany--anything to drive away from your mind
the conviction that you are called upon to espouse the cause of your
country, your subjects! This is the difference between your case and
your grandfather’s--that the crisis which had not arisen in his day
now confronts you. We Emathian Greeks are faced by an organised
conspiracy to despoil us, slay us, make renegades of us--in fact, to
wipe us out, as you would say, from our own country.”

“But how is it? who is doing it?” cried Zoe.

“The schismatics, with Scythia working behind them,” was the reply.
“By immemorial right and tradition Emathia is a Greek country, but
agitators are being sent among the people--ours predominantly by race,
converted, shepherded, educated by us--to persuade them by bribes and
threats to declare themselves Thracians, Dardanians, even
Dacians--anything that may give colour to the fiction of Slav descent,
and consequently alienate them from us.”

“But which are they really? Or are they so mixed that they may be
anything?”

“The mixture of races and languages is extraordinary,” conceded the
Professor unwillingly. “But in the incredible confusion that exists,
we Greeks alone present a clear issue. Until recently, every Christian
in the Roumi dominions was styled a Greek without question, and if our
people are not tampered with, we can continue to supply them with
education and religious ministrations, and confine their agitation for
release from Roum within legal limits. But this unites against us all
the aspiring nationalities--as they call themselves--that covet
Emathian territory, and the result is that our churches are
desecrated, and whole families massacred for the sole crime of
fidelity to Orthodoxy. I dare not recount in the presence of your
sister the fate that has befallen young Greek schoolmistresses, living
unprotected in the villages of the parents of their pupils.”

“Why send unprotected girls to run such risks?”

“The girls accepted them of their own free will,” returned the
Professor smartly. “They placed the Greek cause--the cause of their
race--above life itself.”

“What do you want me to do?” demanded Maurice.

“Your countrymen in Emathia need a rallying-point, a hope. Inevitably
many of them succumb, less to the temptations held out than to the
reign of terror that surrounds them, and declare themselves Thracians
or Dardanians. A Thracian or Dardanian priest takes charge of them, a
school follows, and the next generation will actually be Thracians or
Dardanians by education. But let it be whispered among them secretly
that a deliverer is at hand, that the descendant of their ancient
rulers is waiting to place himself at their head, and they will hold
out. At the same time, the minds of the wealthy Greeks in the cities,
in Czarigrad itself, will also be prepared, and when the outrages of
the revolutionary committees have stirred Europe from its lethargy, we
shall appeal against them. The impossibility of discovering a suitable
ruler for Emathia, who would also be acceptable to its inhabitants,
has been the great difficulty of the past, but when a man appears who
has actually the right to rule, and yet is willing to stand as the
nominee of the Powers, as Vali, Commissioner, Prince--what you
will--they must accept the solution with relief, from pure weariness
of the subject. It has been the case already in Minoa. Once you were
established, the Roumis could not long hold Czarigrad. For four
centuries they have occupied European soil, though only as birds of
passage. They will leave no monuments, their very houses are temporary
lodging-places. They have always kept one eye on Asia, and when the
moment comes they will return thither--perhaps without striking a
blow. You will have delivered Europe from its most shameful stain.”

“Oh, Maurice, you will do it?” entreated Zoe.

“You don’t understand,” said Maurice harshly. “The Professor is
talking of success, but what about failure? And this is not the kind
of thing that can be lightly begun, and laid down if it seems to be
going to fail. If we once take it up, we can never drop it.”

Zoe would have remonstrated, but the Professor stopped her.

“Your brother is right, Miss Teffany,” he said, “and I rejoice at the
spirit in which he approaches the matter. That he should perceive so
clearly that the contest can end only with his life, and yet
contemplate entering upon it, gives me the most vivid hope for the
future. But as I have been instrumental in placing this choice before
him, may I be permitted to make a suggestion? Do not decide at once,
sir. Pay a visit to Emathia, and do me the honour of being my guest at
my villa near Therma. My house in the city itself is untenanted during
the summer, but in the hills you and your sister will find the climate
pleasant and salubrious. My wife, a most estimable woman, with the
heart of a cook and the form of the Niederwald Germania, will rejoice
to display for your benefit the resources of her skill.”

“But if you are constantly exposed to these revolutionary raids, a
country house can scarcely be safe for ladies,” said Maurice,
frowning.

“There is a Roumi garrison not far off, and I am on good terms with
the officers. You must understand that, before quitting my
professorial chair at Benna, I had become heir to the very
considerable possessions of a relative. All that I own is consecrated
to the Greek cause, and a portion of it smoothes my way with the Roumi
authorities, and thus enables me to maintain communication with the
Greeks scattered throughout Emathia. The Committees accuse us, of
course, of being traitors to the Christian faith, but can they wonder
that we should prefer the Roumis to such Christians as they are? But
come and visit me at Kallimeri, and you shall see the state of things
for yourself. You shall meet the leaders of the Greek party, and you
shall have every opportunity I can contrive to become acquainted with
the methods of the Slav propagandists. You are committed to nothing
unless you choose.”

“I will think about it, and give you an answer to-morrow.”

“Oh, Maurice, to-night, to-night!” entreated Zoe. “Think of the copy I
could get! I shan’t sleep a wink.”

“To-morrow,” replied Maurice inexorably, and Zoe went to bed murmuring
“_Zoe Theophanes, de stirpe imperatorum_,” with loving iteration.

“You mustn’t think that Maurice is slack or cold-hearted,” she said to
the Professor, meeting him in the garden the next morning. “He won’t
be hurried into anything, and he never lets any one make up his mind
for him, but when once he sees that a thing is right, he holds on to
it like grim death.”

“Precisely my own reading of your brother’s character,” agreed the
Professor. “Shall I confess that I was at first a little disappointed
at not finding in Mr Teffany that enthusiasm for our persecuted
compatriots which is so manifest in his sister? But I perceived
quickly the tenacity of his purpose--a quality which it is even more
important to enlist on our side.”

“Yes,” said Zoe warmly, “if he once decides to join you, you will
never be disappointed in him. He is so thoroughly dependable. Of
course, I never let him know what I think of him,” she added
inconsequently--“it wouldn’t be good for him--but he is splendid. Very
few men would have gone to college, as he did, at a good deal over the
usual age, after practically managing the estate for my grandfather
for years. But he felt it was the right thing to do, and as soon as he
was free he did it.”

“But surely you did the same?”

“Yes, I went up to Girtham at the same time. But a girl is always
thankful to get an education, you know, just as a boy is always
thankful to escape it. So you won’t hurry Maurice, will you, or try to
influence his judgment?”

“My lips are sealed, unless Mr Teffany himself addresses me on the
subject. But I am infinitely indebted to Miss Teffany for her
warning.”

The Professor’s thanks gave Zoe an uncomfortable feeling of disloyalty
to Maurice, and, in flat contradiction of the advice she had just
given, she attacked her brother on the momentous subject when she saw
him next.

“Oh, Maurice, you will do it, won’t you? It is so splendid to think of
your driving the Roumis from Czarigrad, and establishing peace in
Emathia.”

“The question at present before the House is that of our summer trip,”
was the discouraging reply.

“But that shows you are inclined to take up the matter, doesn’t it? If
it doesn’t, why hesitate about going to Therma?”

“Because I can’t bring myself to trust the Professor absolutely. I
should object to be entirely in his hands.”

“I know; I saw you were not quite satisfied. But why?”

“Did you like the way he spoke of his wife? I should have thought that
would have rubbed you the wrong way at once.”

“Why, Maurice, it was a whole life’s tragedy compressed into two
lines! I thought how artistically he did it, revealing the state of
affairs without unduly obtruding his sorrows upon us. I do adore a
light touch.”

“Oh, don’t talk shop! Well, then, didn’t it strike you how determined
he was that we should see everything in Emathia from one side--his
side, of course? It isn’t reasonable that the Greek Emathians should
possess all the virtues and the other fellows all the vices. I want to
know what the Thracians and Dardanians have to say for themselves.”

“Well, perhaps you will be able to manage that.”

“Not if I am exhibited from the very beginning as the private property
of Professor Panagiotis. The man may be perfectly straight, but it’s
unlikely, to say the least, that he doesn’t expect to reap a full
equivalent for any services he may render.”

“Oh, you think he would want to be Premier or something?”

“Something a good deal more, I should say. Keeper of my conscience,
power behind the throne, and that sort of thing. And you see, he has
the game in his hands. I have nothing but my name, he has the sinews
of war, the local knowledge, the political organisation, and he thinks
that corners me. ‘Such cunning they who dwell on high Have given unto
the Greek.’ No, I haven’t decided, Zoe. I’m thinking it out, and if I
can see a way of going to Therma without delivering myself over body
and soul to Panagiotis, you shall have your trip. I know that ‘copy’
is more important than anything in heaven or earth.”

Somewhat abashed, Zoe retired, and if she said little, thought the
more until, after dinner, Maurice again suggested a move into the
library. She waited in breathless suspense.

“My sister and I have been talking over your kind invitation, sir,” he
said, rather formally, “and if you can assure us on one or two points,
we shall accept it with pleasure. It is understood that we come purely
as your private guests, and that we are at liberty to cultivate the
society of the opposite party, as well as of your own friends, as far
as opportunity offers?”

“You shall enjoy every opportunity that I can give you,” returned the
Professor heartily. “I will not pretend that Committee leaders are
often to be found near Kallimeri, for the Roumi garrison close at hand
is too strong, but their dupes, the peasants, you will be able to
question. And as for your first condition, I shall surprise you by
asking for a greater degree of privacy than you expect. I am going to
request that you will conceal your too-significant surname under an
alias.”

“I don’t see the necessity,” said Maurice stiffly.

“Without this precaution, I cannot guarantee your safety. Consider, my
dear sir; the difference between Theophanis and Teffany is not so
great but that their identity may occur to a watchful enemy--or to
many at once. Then you and your sister are at once set up as a target
for the efforts of the many whose interest it is to have you removed.”

“Then there are other claimants?” asked Maurice, conscious that Zoe
had turned a little pale.

“Who is not a claimant? The King of Thracia would like to add Emathia
to his dominions, but we need not fear him since he has got rid of his
English Prime Minister. That firebrand, the Princess Dowager of
Dardania, who filched from us the province of Rhodope a few years ago,
intended to merge her son’s petty principality in a State comprising
the whole of Emathia. She has now quarrelled with him, but she
continues her intrigues on behalf of her younger son, an officer in
the Scythian army. I need not remind you of the desires of Scythia,
Pannonia, and Morea, and you have always to consider the revolutionary
committees, many of whose members are fanatical republicans. No, Mr
Teffany, I cannot accept the responsibility of your visit unless you
will consent to pass by a less distinctive name.”

“Very well,” said Maurice reluctantly, this sudden turning of the
tables upon him serving, perhaps, to stimulate his unfixed resolution.

“Then we will be Smiths, of course,” said Zoe joyfully. “We have a
hereditary right to the name, and it is splendid for an alias, because
no one will think it is one.”

“Moreover,” proceeded the Professor, “you must remember that you are
not altogether unprovided with relations, outside the limits of that
pedigree there. For instance, your ancestor Alexius Theophanis, the
first of the name to settle in England, came to Cornwall from Italy,
where many of the Greek families preserved their nationality and faith
for more than a century. He left there a sister, Eudoxia, who married
Romanos Christodorides, and became the ancestress of the powerful
family of Christodoridi, Despots of the island of Strio. Her
descendants would not succeed until after those of her brother, of
course.”

“And they would naturally not be sorry to see the brother’s
descendants wiped out, you mean?” suggested Maurice.

“Hardly that. Prince Christodoridi would probably prefer to base his
claim on the invalidity of the marriage of Alexius Theophanis with a
foreigner and a member of another church, contrary to the law of the
Imperial house.”

“If that’s true, he holds a pretty strong card,” said Maurice.

“The law was disregarded several times,” said Zoe quickly. “Gibbon
says so.”

The Professor regarded her approvingly. “Quite so. But as we do not
wish to incite the Christodoridis to take action, we will not bring
your existence to their ears before it is necessary. In any case,
Prince Christodoridi’s claims are unimportant. The Emperor John, your
heroic ancestor, left another son and two daughters besides your
progenitor Basil. Anna, the eldest daughter, married Boris, Grand
Prince of Scythia, and carried the blood of the Cæsars into the
Scythian Imperial house. Helena, the younger, married into the Dacian
family of Gratianco, from which is descended the mother of Prince
Timoleon Malasorte, the Neustrian Imperial claimant. But these claims
through females are merely curious. The only person whose right at all
approaches yours is the descendant of Leo, second son of John
Theophanis. About forty years ago the officiousness of Scythian agents
ferreted out in Dacia an obscure landed proprietor directly descended
from Leo. He was invited to Pavelsburg, decorated, given the title of
Royal Highness, with estates and a pension to support it, and
complimented with the hope of being restored to his ancestor’s throne.
Of course there was no thought of fulfilling the promises made him;
the only intention was to keep him under surveillance. He wore out his
life in fruitless attempts to get his cause adopted, and when I
managed to approach him, as I have now approached you, he had not the
energy to take the steps to which my advice and the detestation he had
conceived for Scythia would have urged him. He left only a daughter,
and it was this disappointment which sent me to England to make one
more attempt to trace the descendants of Basil. A male heir in the
male line is what we want. The work before us is not for women.”

“This man was a Theophanis, then?” asked Maurice.

“Prince Nicolai Andréivitch Féofan--so they call it in Scythia. It
seems that his family had preserved the memory of their Imperial
descent through the centuries, though fear of the Roumis kept them
from disclosing it. When he was summoned to Pavelsburg, he thought it
only an ante-room to Czarigrad, and when he found himself deceived, he
wished to retire to Dacia again, but this was not permitted. At his
death, he was little better than a State prisoner, and he left his
daughter in the same position. No doubt a marriage will be arranged
for her with one of the less important Grand Dukes, that her claim
also may be safely vested in the Imperial family.”

“Poor thing!” said Zoe. Now that Maurice’s claim was incontestably
established to be the strongest, she felt a curious pity for the girl
who must believe herself to be what Maurice actually was, the rightful
inheritor of the glories of the Empire of the East.




 CHAPTER III.
 THE ORIENT EXPRESS.

Not more than three weeks later, Maurice and Zoe stood on the
platform of the Gare de l’Est, about to enter upon the second stage of
their journey eastwards. Professor Panagiotis had urged that they
should start as soon as possible, before the increasing heat should
make railway travelling disagreeable, but he scouted Zoe’s suggestion
that they should go when he did. Their visiting him at Kallimeri would
attract quite sufficient attention, he said, and it was most important
that no idea of their being connected in any way with his political
schemes should get abroad. He had made the arrangements for their
journey, procuring them passports as Maurice and Zoe Smith, and, at
his suggestion, Maurice had requested his bankers to honour cheques
bearing their signatures in these names. It was understood among their
friends that Zoe had persuaded Maurice to take her to Eastern Europe
that she might lay the scene of a novel there, and she gave colour to
the opinion by the number of note-books of different sorts and sizes
which made her luggage heavy, if not bulky. These were destined to
cause endless trouble at the several frontiers, for the official mind,
unable to understand why so many blank volumes should be needed,
conceived the idea that they contained Anarchist literature written in
invisible ink, and insisted on subjecting them to severe tests. But
this was still in the future, and Zoe was rejoicing in the imminent
prospect of romance, to be not only written but lived. During the few
hours they spent in London, she had dragged Maurice to Westminster
Abbey, that they might visit the obscure grave of “Mr Nicholas
Thephany.” Maurice refused sternly to allow her to take a wreath for
it, but she succeeded, behind his back, in dropping upon the stone the
handful of carnations which had been tucked into her belt.
Unfortunately, they were carefully gathered up and returned to her by
a polite verger, which spoilt the significance of the act, and exposed
her to Maurice’s sarcasms. But nothing could detract from the joy of
having an ancestor buried in the Abbey, or of tracing one’s lineage
back to the Cæsars.

At the Paris station Zoe’s eyes met Maurice’s, in a kind of
half-ashamed smile, across the pile of luggage conspicuously labelled
“Smith,” while he was directing the porter, but before she had time to
make any remark a uniformed attendant approached.

“The other ladies of Monsieur’s party are here,” he said, and they
followed him mechanically, too much astonished to protest. He led the
way to a compartment intended for four, in which two ladies were
already seated, one elderly, with an almost aggressive air of high
breeding, the other a girl rather younger than Zoe, in a smart
travelling-gown, which had not come from the hands of any English
tailor. Zoe, surveying it from the satisfactory standpoint of her own
workmanlike coat and skirt, remarked mentally that it simply shrieked
“Vindobona!” The ladies’ luggage, which occupied the other two seats,
was labelled “Smith.” With a wave of his hand the attendant motioned
Maurice and Zoe to enter, and departed. Zoe imagined that he received
an approving glance from the younger lady, who sprang up and began to
move her possessions.

“Oh, we are to be fellow-passengers, then?” she cried pleasantly,
speaking with a slight foreign accent. “That is excessively agreeable.
Pray come in.”

“There must be some mistake----” began Maurice.

“A mistake? But let us convert it into an advantage! We shall be
delighted to enjoy your society.”

“Edith! Heart’s dearest!” cried the other lady, speaking English with
an obvious effort, “you outrage the proprieties, you affront Monsieur
and Mademoiselle. Recall the position, I beg of you.”

“It does not seem to me that Monsieur and Mademoiselle are in the
least affronted,” said the girl readily, but with a heightened colour.
“Is it not natural for us to travel together--as compatriots, and
doubtless distant relations?” with a little bow which had a suspicion
of mockery in its politeness.

“You are very kind----” said Zoe stiffly, but the elderly lady
interrupted her.

“Did I not tell you so, Emily?” Zoe intercepted an angry glance of
warning from the girl. “The young lady is scandalised--shocked--at
your behaviour. Pray do not persist.”

“We are very much obliged,” said Zoe firmly, “but we have chosen our
seats elsewhere, and our things are waiting for us.”

“But you could have them brought here,” suggested the irrepressible
Miss Smith.

“Thank you, but we are going to have dinner as soon as the train
starts.”

“Ah, we have dined already, but after this evening we might share a
table. Why are you so little kind?” the girl’s voice followed Zoe
pleadingly as she closed the discussion by turning away. She had an
odd feeling of self-reproach, though she had only acted in the most
prudent and proper way, and Maurice offered her no comfort. He could
not bring himself to say that the unconventional invitation ought to
have been accepted, but it was evident he thought she might have
managed to decline it without hurting Miss Smith’s feelings. It was
not until they were half-way through dinner that the sense of
constraint produced by the incident wore off, and Zoe felt inclined to
talk freely.

“I feel so delightfully thrilled!” she said, leaning back luxuriously.
“My heart always leaps up when I see the words ‘Orient Express’--just
as the sight of a cabin-trunk with a P. & O. label makes me think of
the Black Hole and the Mutiny and all sorts of interesting things--and
now to be actually on board! Have you found out yet which is the
compartment always reserved for an emissary of the British
Government?”

“Patience, patience!” entreated Maurice. “Give a man a little time.”

“Well, I have spotted the man--the emissary I mean,” said Zoe
triumphantly. “He has J. G. W. on his bag, and he is a soldier and has
been in India, and he has the most startlingly blue eyes I ever saw.”

“Now, why startling?” asked Maurice tolerantly.

“Why, with that brown face and fairly dark hair you expect dark eyes,
and it gives you quite a shock when he looks up and you see how blue
they are.”

“I expect the startling man with the blue eyes got a shock when he
looked up and found you staring at him. I know the fellow you mean,
but when you managed to find out the details of his personal history
beats me.”

“Purely inference, my dear boy. Any one could see he was a soldier,
and he has the Indian look about the eyebrows.”

“My good girl, Sherlock Holmes was nothing to you.”

“Thanks, so much! I believe he is a King’s messenger.”

“Inference again, I suppose?”

“Well, he seems to have something on his mind. I can’t quite decide
whether he’s in charge of something very precious, or whether he has
lived so much among enemies that he’s got into the habit of being
always on the alert for an attack.”

“It’s just as well you are a little modest, for I’m pretty certain
that a King’s messenger wears a badge of some sort, and lugs a
despatch-box about with him.”

“Oh, Maurice, you are dense! Of course he is on very special service,
and has been warned not to exhibit anything that would reveal his
identity.”

“And he is so clever in concealing it that he lets himself be spotted
by the first girl he runs across who’s been reading detective stories!
Tell you what, I’ll make up to him and break his self-betrayal to him
gently. He really ought to know.”

“Oh no, don’t ask him outright what he is! It’s so much more
interesting to think of him as a King’s messenger than as somebody’s
nephew on his way to spend part of his leave at Czarigrad. He doesn’t
look important enough for a military attaché.”

“Look here, Zoe, you really must curb your unbridled imagination.
You’ll have the whole train peopled with mysterious personalities in
no time. By the bye,” with elaborate carelessness, “what do you make
of our namesakes?”

“Mrs Smith may possibly have married an Englishman,” meditatively,
“but her name is the only English thing about her. As for the girl,
her name is no more Smith than----”

“Ours is!” cried Maurice. “The plot thickens. Go on.”

“I believe she is a Scythian spy,” said Zoe calmly.

“Oh, draw it mild! That girl? I say, this fitting people with
imaginary characters is all very well, but you have no right---- Do
spies generally go about chaperoned by elderly aunts?”

“If it is her aunt. Why, Maurice, don’t you see? She has designs upon
the document which the King’s messenger is in charge of, of course,
and even the very youngest and greenest of King’s messengers would be
suspicious of a fascinating unchaperoned young lady by this time.”

“Well, I should have said if she had designs on any one, it was on
you.”

“Oh, that’s only a blind. No; I see it! She isn’t sure about the
King’s messenger. He has effaced himself so carefully that she is
wavering between you and him. My presence may be intended to divert
suspicion from you, as the aunt’s is from her, and she will try to
attack you by getting round me. Then in the night I shall catch her,
with a dark lantern, ransacking my dressing-bag, because she will
think I have the document concealed in it. There, Maurice!”

“If you must make up these idiotic things, you might as well try to
put just a touch of probability into them.”

“Probability! Why, it’s all but certainty. Of course, she’s not a
professional spy. She is some one of very high rank who has got
herself into the power of the Scythian Government, either by gambling
or by being mixed up in political movements. That explains why, with
all her anxiety for our acquaintance, she was determined to keep me in
my place. Don’t you know how gratified a City lady feels when she has
been presented to Royalty at a bazaar? She tells all her friends how
affable the dear Princess was, but that no one would dream of taking a
liberty with her. I don’t in the least want to take liberties with
Miss Edith Emily Smith, but she is afraid I might, and so she adopts
this superior tone. Oh, Maurice, if she only knew! Isn’t it perfectly
lovely to think of?”

“The waiter has been watching despairingly for your plate for some
time,” said Maurice. “When you have quite finished, I shall be glad to
go and get a smoke.”

“And you are to be sure and make friends with the King’s messenger,
mind,” said Zoe, hastily finishing her dessert; but Maurice replied
darkly, as he turned towards the smoking-car, that he would not
promise.

Returning to her own compartment, not without a secret intention of
glancing in at Mrs and Miss Smith as she passed, Zoe had a narrow
escape of falling headlong over a travelling-bag which the younger
lady, with reckless disregard for the safety of the public, was
thrusting out into the corridor. The offender was profuse in her
apologies.

“Oh, how careless I am!” she cried. “You might have hurt yourself
seriously. I should never have forgiven myself if my negligence had
injured you, of all people.”

“Your malignity, rather, for it’s quite clear you did it on purpose,”
was Zoe’s mental comment. “Why am I so much more precious than all the
other people on board?” she asked.

“Oh, because----” with arch hesitation--“because of that mistake about
our names, you know, and because you and I are the only young girls in
the train. Certainly we ought to help one another.”

“I should say you needed about as little help as any person I know.
And you needn’t try to flirt with _me_!” thought the unbelieving Zoe.
“How could I help you?” she inquired aloud.

“Oh, come and talk to me a little. My aunt is always sleeping. I feel
idle. All the people in the train have some acquaintance, some
occupation, except ourselves”--she indicated the slumbering Mrs Smith
and herself. “Even you are doubtless travelling for the sake of the
business of your respectable brother? Oh!” as she caught the shadow of
a smile on Zoe’s face, “is that bad English? Now you see what help you
can give me in teaching me to speak my own language.”

“Oh, we have no business to see to; we are only out on a spree--if you
know that word?” said Zoe wickedly. “My brother has just done with
college, and we felt he deserved a holiday. If we have any business,
it’s mine--looking for local colour. You know what that is--the stuff
which you have to put into a book if you’re writing it, but which you
always skip in reading it? Everybody that knows about my writing is
always saying, ‘Oh, you must travel. It will enlarge your mind so
much, and think of the local colour you will gain!’ I have note-books
crammed full of local colour, only waiting for the stories which are
to bring it in, and the worst of it is that when I do write anything,
I am always so frightfully interested in the people that the local
colour gets crowded out.”

Miss Smith looked somewhat bewildered by this fragment of literary
autobiography. “Then you are an author--a Bohemian?” she said, with a
distinct touch of disapproval.

“An author? Well, in a sort of way--a very humble way at present. But
a Bohemian--oh, no! I only wish I was! Who ever heard such a stolid,
steady-going name as Smith associated with Bohemianism?---- I knew it!
I knew her name wasn’t Smith!” she told herself delightedly, noticing
that the other girl did not wince.

“And I have not even the excuse of looking for local colour!” remarked
the self-styled Miss Smith. “I wanted to travel--to be really
English--and I made my aunt come. She is a foreigner--you may have
noticed?--and she has brought me up abroad with her.”

“I fancy you brought yourself up, wherever you were. I don’t think
poor Mrs Smith had much voice in the matter,” thought Zoe. “Well, you
ought to be satisfied now,” she said aloud.

“I know I ought, but do you know”--the girl bent towards her
confidentially--“I am a little--almost frightened. We have never
travelled unattended before, and my aunt is so nervous.”

“But why in the world didn’t you bring a maid or a courier, or both?”
cried Zoe, astonished.

“That is what we ought to have done, of course, and at Therma I shall
insist on our finding suitable attendants. But I was going to propose
that we should join forces for the journey. If you and your brother
will favour us with your society--especially at meals--we should have
no fear of making disagreeable acquaintances.” She spoke with the
utmost coolness, and without any of the blushing diffidence that might
have been expected--almost as if the suggestion, which should surely
in any case have come from her aunt, was an honour not to be declined.

“My good girl, what _is_ your game?” thought the scandalised Zoe. “Is
it Maurice?” with a sister’s instinctive vigilance. “If it is, you are
the very coolest hand I ever saw. I don’t think you need be in the
least frightened,” she said frigidly. “English ladies are not likely
to be molested when there are so many Englishmen in the train.”

“What did I tell you, Eirene?” cried Mrs Smith, waking at an
inopportune moment. “You have too little regard for the conventions.
This young lady finds your freedom altogether shocking.”

“Edith--Emily--Irene! How many more names has she got?” was Zoe’s
mental comment as she watched, rather mercilessly, the flush which
rose into Miss Smith’s face.

“I have requested you already to leave this matter to me,” said the
young lady coldly, and the aunt collapsed. “Yes, my name is Eirene,”
turning to Zoe with a radiant smile. “Spelt with an E, you know,” as
Zoe’s eyes wandered to the “E. E. Smith” upon a jewel-case. “We were
so anxious to be English that my aunt has been trying to call me by a
real English name, but it is no use. I hope you will call me Eirene in
future. And you will relieve my curiosity by telling me your name? Z
is such a strange initial, and I saw it upon your bag.”

“My name is Zoe,” admitted the owner of the name reluctantly as she
rose to leave the compartment.

“A Greek name, surely, like my own? Perhaps we are really distant
cousins after all! Then it is settled that you and your brother join
us at meals?”

“I beg your pardon, we have already made our arrangements, and secured
a table that only holds two,” said the exasperated Zoe, flinging this
Parthian shaft as she departed with all the dignity that the motion of
the train would allow.

“What is she after?” she asked herself again as she reached her own
compartment, whither Maurice had not yet returned. “Can she really be
a spy? If so, I suppose the best thing will be to appear quite
innocent and unsuspicious. She can’t make us tell anything we don’t
want to. I must give Maurice a hint not to let her worm things out of
him. The funny part is that I believe she really is frightened. Her
eyes were upon every one who passed. Pardon me, that seat is engaged,”
as some one pressed past her. “Oh, this is really too much!” for the
intruder was Miss Smith, who sat down in Maurice’s place, gripping the
arms of the seat as though she feared Zoe would eject her by force.

“I wished to tell you that they will place us at the same table at
breakfast,” she said hurriedly. “The man came to ask me just as a
matter of course, and I--I said, ‘_Mais sans doute_.’ I meant to do
it, and yet--it slipped out at the moment. I am come to entreat you
not to countermand the order. You can’t understand what a difference
it will make to me to be allowed to travel as a member of a party--of
a family.”

The wildest suspicions were seething in Zoe’s brain. What was this
girl--a murderess, a Nihilist, or a thief? What designs might she not
have on Maurice, on his prospects? Anxiety for him made her manner
glacial. “I am sorry we cannot add to our party,” she said. “We are
going to stay with friends.”

“But it is only for the journey!” cried the girl eagerly. “Once at
Therma, you go your way, I mine. We do not meet again, but you will
hear--yes, you will certainly hear about me, and I assure you that you
won’t find me ungrateful.”

“I don’t care about your gratitude,” said Zoe bluntly. “What I want to
be sure of is that you are not doing anything wrong.”

“Wrong? What wrong should I do? Do you think I am an Anarchist, laden
with bombs to fling at the Grand Seignior? I find your suspicions
singularly insulting.”

“I am sorry for it. Has it occurred to you that I might think the same
of your persistent efforts to force your company upon us?” “That will
fetch her, if anything will!” said Zoe triumphantly to herself.

The girl’s eyes flamed. “You are insolent!” she flashed out. “How dare
you---- But no, I have drawn it upon myself. Mademoiselle, will you
accept my assurance that I have no evil-doing in view? I am taking my
journey upon a purely family matter, confided to me by a dying parent.
I carry with me my jewels, which are of considerable
value--inestimable value to me. Upon their safety may hang the success
of my expedition. Once more I ask you to grant me the protection of
your company and that of Monsieur your brother, and pray do not think
that it is easy for me to entreat. I am not accustomed to it.”

“I think we ought to have some idea of your object before being asked
to mix ourselves up with it,” said Zoe, but less firmly.

“If it affected myself alone, I would reveal it to you without a
moment’s hesitation, but it concerns others. No, if my assurance is
not enough for you, you must continue to regard me as an adventuress,
a spy--what you will--and I must endure it.” She folded her hands in
her lap with sorrowful dignity, but her lips were quivering, and a
tear rolled slowly down her face.

“Oh, don’t cry!” said Zoe hastily, with the modern woman’s horror of
tears. “Of course you can have your meals with us, and we’ll travel
together if you really want it. Only I can’t say that you belong to us
if I’m asked.”

“You will not be asked. A family party will pass unquestioned. It is
two ladies alone who would attract attention. Oh, I am so glad!” she
cried, abandoning disguise, and drying her eyes vigorously. “Evdotia
Vladimirovna--my aunt, I mean--is so frightened, and I have been
obliged to encourage her, and I was so frightened myself. Every one
might be a spy or a secret agent. Then I saw the luggage with the name
‘Smith,’ and I saw you and your brother, and your faces looked
trustworthy, and I thought we should be safe with you. I shall never
forget this service, you may be sure,” with a return to stateliness,
as she rose and departed.

“I feel a regular fool!” said Zoe viciously to herself. “But, after
all, she did play fair. If she had attacked Maurice instead of me, she
wouldn’t have had a quarter of the trouble.”

“I have scraped acquaintance with your startling-eyed friend,” said
Maurice, coming in. “He is not a King’s messenger, you will be
interested to hear, but an Indian officer going back after his leave.
He’s to stay a week or two with a friend who’s in the Emathian
Gendarmerie, and his name’s Wylie.”

“Well, I told you nearly as much about him simply from inference. Did
you hear anything about Miss Smith?”

“Oh, one fat old chap, who seems to come this way about once a week
and knows all the officials, was very busy hinting that he had it from
the sleeping-car attendant that she was somebody very big travelling
_incog_.”

“A Princess running away from school, I should think!” murmured Zoe.
“Well, to-morrow morning either she will sink in the general
estimation or we shall go up, for we are to breakfast together.”

“You don’t mean to say that you have taken her up after all?” cried
Maurice. “Well, don’t say it was my doing.” But his warning tone was
not wholly devoid of satisfaction.




 CHAPTER IV.
 A FULL STOP.

In after days it seemed to Zoe that the stages of the journey were
marked by the progress of her intimacy with Eirene Smith. There was
that terrible midnight hour when, sleepy and bewildered, she was
called upon by a ferocious German customs officer to explain the
nature and purpose of the note-books in her dressing-bag, and could
reply in nothing but scraps of French, Latin, and Greek, which ought
to have increased the official’s respect for her, but only deepened
his suspicions. Not a word of German would come to her mind, and the
occupant of the other berth, an elderly French lady in an astonishing
nightcap, was not only of no practical use, but was evidently watching
between her curtains with awful joy to see Zoe haled from the train
and arraigned before the authorities. Never was anything more welcome
than the appearance of Eirene from the next cabin in an exquisite
embroidered dressing-gown. She had heard the altercation, and, coming
upon the scene, assumed the direction of affairs. Her German did not
forsake her, and the customs officer went away placated, but grimly
assuring Zoe that she might thank _Ihre Fräulein Schwester_ that she
and her possessions were not detained. The relief was great, and Zoe
thanked Eirene heartily in rather tremulous tones. The French lady,
disappointed of her expected sensation, transferred herself easily to
the side of the victor, and inveighed against the brutality of the
official while eulogising the courage and coolness of Eirene.

“And the prudence also of mademoiselle!” she cried. “She has there
even her jewel-case, not forgetting to snatch it up at a moment of the
greatest tension!”

“I never let it leave me,” said Eirene simply. “See, madame, they are
very precious to me, these jewels. They are of the possessions of my
late dear mother.”

She opened the box, and took out one or two of the trinkets it
contained, handsome and old-fashioned; not at all sufficient, in Zoe’s
opinion, to account for the anxiety she had expressed in speaking of
them to her.

“Ah, very pretty,” said madame, regarding them with greedy eyes. “Too
old in style for a young girl, but you will doubtless have them reset.
But how comes it that all the jewels are yours, mademoiselle, while
your elder sister wears not so much as a pin?”

“We are not own sisters, madame,” returned Eirene, with a fascinating
mixture of truth and audacity. “But that makes no difference to our
love, does it, my Zoe?”

Eirene had the jewel-case with her again when she and Zoe met in the
dressing-room the next morning. They had been charged to make haste,
as the elder ladies desired the room to themselves for the process of
hair-dressing, which could not properly be performed before youthful
eyes, but Eirene fastened the doors and opened her box a second time.

“Now I will show you!” she said gleefully. “You shall see that I trust
you, though you don’t trust me, and that I am willing to confide to
you anything that affects myself alone. Look, then!” and Zoe gazed,
astonished, as the satin lining of the lid fell forward on the
pressure of a spring, revealing a wonderful necklace of huge pearls
fitting into a shallow receptacle evidently constructed for it. In
like manner the sides and trays of the box, judiciously manipulated,
revealed a number of emerald and diamond sprays--the stones
extraordinarily fine--which might either be used separately, or united
to form a necklace or tiara, and a bodice ornament of great rubies in
the shape of a globe flanked by spreading wings, with a deep pendant.
Lastly, Eirene showed that the box had also a false bottom.

“This is my greatest treasure,” she said, exhibiting a number of
golden plaques which could be fastened one to another to form a
girdle. Each plaque was curiously embossed with the figure of a saint,
apparently raised in enamel upon the gold background, while the halo
and portions of the dress were encrusted with precious stones. “I am
obliged to take it to pieces for travelling, but I do it with terror,
for it is old--yes, of an astonishing antiquity, and there is nothing
like it in the whole world.”

“It must be Byzantine work, surely?” asked Zoe, examining it with
intense interest.

Eirene looked at her with something like suspicion. “Yes,” she said
coldly, and, taking the massive clasp from Zoe’s hands, she returned
it to its place and snapped down the false bottom over it. Her
displeasure was so uncalled for that Zoe experienced a return of the
unamiable feelings of the evening before, but before the box had been
restored to its usual appearance the momentary cloud had passed away,
and Eirene was replying with gay defiance to Mrs Smith’s remonstrances
through the closed door on her delay.

The next stage in Zoe’s appreciation of her new friend’s personality
came at breakfast-time, when Eirene remarked with smiling effrontery
to Maurice, whom Zoe had just introduced to her with a formality
intended to show that the acquaintance of the day before was
insufficient--

“It is so kind of Zoe to have arranged everything, so that we need not
enter upon any tiresome explanations. Please be assured of my best
thanks for adopting me as a sister during the journey. Until we part
at Therma I am Eirene, if you please. You, if I am not mistaken, are
Maurice?”

As much astonished as his rightful sister, and conscious of Mrs
Smith’s face of wrathful agony in the background, Maurice had
sufficient presence of mind to accept the situation, and mutter
something about pleasure and honour. The only unembarrassed member of
the party was Eirene herself, who motioned Zoe to the seat beside her
at the table, and Maurice to that opposite, informing her outraged
aunt that she would find her step-nephew _bien gentil_ and truly
conversable. Taking the lead herself as a matter of course, she
insisted on making the talk general, and before long Maurice and Zoe
found their embarrassment fading away. Mrs Smith remained implacable,
and answered only when she was directly addressed; but the other three
were able to laugh and talk quite naturally. From his solitary table
on the other side of the gangway, the man whom Zoe had styled the
King’s messenger watched them with wistful amusement.

“It’s pretty clear the younger girl is only Smith’s step-sister,” he
said to himself, “and the aunt is her private property. I suppose the
aunt married the father’s brother, as her name is Smith too. No, that
would make her their aunt as well. It’s a sort of puzzle in
relationships; but with such a common name it may well be a mere
coincidence. I should say the aunt and the younger girl’s mother were
foreign and noble, and a good deal inclined to look down on the plain
English part of the family. Smith will soon get tired of being
tyrannised over by that little minx, and I could see Miss Smith didn’t
half like it when they came in. It’s the sort of thing that palls
pretty quickly. I suppose they wanted to make the step-sister’s
acquaintance, but why bring the aunt, who has evidently made her the
sun and centre of things? What a pity we can’t eliminate Mrs Smith! If
she was out of the way--a convenient headache, now--I think Smith
might take pity upon my loneliness and ask me to their table. They
sound awfully jolly all together, and with three of us against her, it
would be hard if we couldn’t take Miss Eirene down a peg. Her brother
and sister are much too meek.”

Mrs Smith was not accommodating enough to have a headache--indeed, her
expression implied that heartily as she detested her present position,
wild horses should not drag her from it--but Captain Wylie was not
forbidden the introduction he desired. “My sister, Miss Smith--Miss
Eirene Smith,” said Maurice, bringing him up to the girls after
breakfast, and receiving a smile from Eirene for his adroitness,
though the presentation did not seem altogether to please her,
apparently because her consent had not been secured beforehand. She
gave Wylie the cold shoulder, as though she had read his sentiments
towards her and reciprocated them, but Zoe, who had incited Maurice to
introduce him, was quite satisfied. Wylie was the kind of man she
liked. If he would talk, he could tell her things about India which
might be useful in future; if not, she could look at him and make up
far more wonderful things about him herself. He was not much of a
talker, as it turned out, but sufficiently articulate to answer
informingly when he was questioned, and Zoe was a past mistress in the
art of what she called drawing people out, and Maurice, picking their
brains.

As the day wore on it became evident to Zoe that Eirene was growing
increasingly nervous. She could not rest for a moment, but roamed from
one compartment to another, and up and down the corridor, shaking with
agitation when she came face to face with any of the other passengers
or an official. At last Maurice brought out his travelling chess-board
and induced her to sit down to a game, promising that she should walk
off her restlessness at Vindobona, so far as a stop of twenty minutes
and the limits of the station would allow. But when they were
approaching the Imperial city, and Maurice had gone to get his hat,
she clutched Zoe’s arm convulsively.

“Oh, I dare not leave the train! It is here I shall be recognised if
anywhere. Begin a game, quick; then I can keep my head bent over the
board. May I hold your hand?”

Cold and trembling, her hand gripped Zoe’s under the flap of the
table, and she was arranging the pieces when Maurice was heard
returning. The clutch tightened.

“Don’t let them go far from the carriage. Oh, make them return to us
continually! Couldn’t they stay here with us? No, it would excite
suspicion. But tell them not to go far.”

Maurice and Wylie were much puzzled by the girls’ obstinate absorption
in what appeared a singularly erratic game, and their firm refusal to
walk about on the platform, but they made themselves useful by first
going to the bookstall to see what Tauchnitz volumes were in stock,
then making an expedition to buy one for Eirene, a second to get one
for Zoe, and a third to change Eirene’s, which she discovered she had
read before. Zoe was almost as much excited as Eirene by the time this
point was reached. It was all very well to want to keep Maurice near
at hand, but if Eirene was arrested, as she seemed to fear might be
the case, what did she expect him to do? She could scarcely imagine
that he and Wylie would attempt to rescue her from the Pannonian
police. Of course they would appeal to the British Ambassador; but Zoe
did not now believe that Eirene was even a British subject, and
Maurice would probably have to declare his real name, with what danger
to the purpose of his journey who could tell?

“Oh, Zoe, how carelessly you play! Check!” cried Eirene. “You are
worse than you were months ago.” This for the benefit of a guard who
had approached near enough to hear what they said. “Ah, it is nearly
over!” with a sigh of relief. Zoe, looking up with the hasty idea of
asking Maurice to get her some chocolate, by way of manufacturing
another errand, saw to her delight the passengers returning hurriedly
to the train. The dreaded twenty minutes was at an end.

“You know, I ran away,” said Eirene softly to her, as the train glided
out of the station.

“I thought so,” responded Zoe; “but it can’t have been so very bad, as
you took your aunt with you.”

“But I could never have gone alone!” in horror.

“No, I know it isn’t usual,” drily.

“Some day I will tell you how I did it,” pursued Eirene. “I thought I
was safe, but if any of my precautions had failed, I knew it would be
here they would catch me. Oh, and there is still another station
before we are out of Vindobona! Begin another game, quickly!”

But the second station was comparatively unimportant, and the interval
of terror of the briefest, and Zoe and Eirene released one another’s
hands, and pretended to Maurice that a sudden intense interest in
chess had prevented their having any desire to look out at the city
and its buildings. At dinner, notwithstanding Mrs Smith’s objections,
Wylie was accommodated with a temporary and most uncomfortable seat at
the end of the table, and found himself very graciously treated, owing
partly to Eirene’s sense of relief from her fears, and partly to the
alacrity with which he had assisted Maurice in running her errands at
the station. The night passed without alarm, for though the Thracian
frontier had to be crossed, the Customs examination was considerately
delayed until the morning, though it was necessary to get it over
before reaching Tatarjé, where the passengers for Therma changed into
another train, the Express going on to Czarigrad. As she watched it
out of sight, Zoe sighed that half the romance was gone out of the
journey, for the new train was unknown to fame, and by no means
comparable with the wonderful microcosm which had been their home for
nearly two days. Moreover, it moved as deliberately as the most local
of English local trains, and its rusty engine groaned complaints as it
dragged itself reluctantly out of the station.

Tatarjé naturally called up memories of Count Mortimer, the great
English Minister whom the young King of Thracia had discarded on
attaining his majority, and who was one of Zoe’s heroes. Wylie, who
had heard little of him, was quite willing to be instructed and to
share her enthusiasm, but Eirene was contemptuous. It was easy for any
man to rise to power when he served a Queen who was willing to resign
everything into his hands, she said; dealing with men was another
matter. The discussion which ensued was of the nature of those
parallel lines which can never meet, for it appeared that Eirene’s
information was entirely derived from Scythian sources, and possessed
nothing but the statesman’s name in common with Zoe’s. The crossing of
the Roumi frontier gave a desirable change to the conversation, and
Zoe sprang up to look out at “our own country,” as she whispered to
Maurice. Her own country received her inhospitably, for rain was
falling in torrents, and the general aspect was bare and neglected in
the extreme. A squalid little station reached early in the afternoon,
apparently unconnected with any town or village, was crowded with
Roumi soldiers, and Wylie’s professional interest was aroused. He and
Maurice left the carriage, taking with them all the cigarettes they
possessed, and distributed them to the dripping, patient men. An
elderly non-commissioned officer, who had been in Egypt, and
recognising Wylie as a British officer, stood rigorously to attention
when addressed, answered his questions in Arabic. The detachment had
been ordered up to guard the railway, owing to a report that there was
a band of Thracian revolutionaries in the neighbourhood with designs
upon it. They had been at the station since early morning, without
shelter or food, their uniforms ragged, their boots in holes. The
station buildings were occupied by the Kaimakam of the district, under
whose orders they were acting; he was immersed in business, but when
he had time, would doubtless remember the needs of his troops. Some of
the younger and more impatient spirits had spoken of bribing his
secretary to draw his attention to the matter, but apart from the fact
that with their pay months in arrears they could not offer enough to
tempt so great a man, the sergeant considered that such an attempt
would be an improper interference with the decrees of destiny. He
saluted smartly, and stood back among his men, a stolid, shivering
figure of military virtue in evil case.

“Some of the best material in the world!” said Wylie wrathfully to
Maurice. “What soldiers we could make of them in India! British troops
would have mutinied six hours ago. Look at the two sick men in that
goods-shed, with the rain falling on them--and the Kaimakam, no doubt,
is soothing himself with _hashish_ in the station-master’s quarters!”

“Let’s go and rout him out, and shame him into putting the men in
shelter,” said Maurice.

Wylie shook his head. “I daren’t,” he said. “It would only mean
quartering them upon the Christian inhabitants of the village over
there. That’s what’s bound to be done at last, I suppose, but one
wouldn’t care for the responsibility of hurrying it on.”

He looked over the straggling houses of the place, which was visible
at this point round the shoulder of a hill, flat-roofed, dingy white,
huddled together apparently for the sake of company rather than
protection, then brought his eyes back to the face of the old
sergeant, who had advanced and was saluting again.

“Is the Bimbashi Bey come hither to serve in the new Gendarmerie?” he
asked respectfully.

“No; merely to visit a friend,” answered Wylie.

“God be praised!” responded the old man, with evident satisfaction.

“Now why?” demanded Maurice, when Wylie had translated the question.
“Make him say.”

The sergeant needed some pressing, but at length gave his reason
boldly. “The Bey Effendi’s eyes are of the cruel colour,” he said.
“Never have I beheld eyes more cruel, and I have seen many men.”

Wylie’s disconcerted face made Maurice insist upon a translation,
which delighted him extremely. “Ask the old blighter if he really
believes that rot,” he demanded.

“The Bimbashi Bey’s eyes will indeed strike terror into his enemies,
so that they will flee before him and he will grind them to powder,”
returned the sergeant, anxious to be conciliatory. “But his own men
would fain see his eyes like those of the young Effendi, his friend.”

“There! They think you’re squeezable, you see,” said Wylie in triumph.
“When you’re made High Commissioner of Emathia, you’d better send for
me to be your commander-in-chief, and put a little stiffening into
you.”

“All right. Mind, it’s a bargain!” cried Maurice, returning to the
train at the summons of the guard, and smiling to think how closely
Wylie’s jest had approached the possible truth.

“Oh, Maurice, it’s an omen!” came in an awestruck whisper from Zoe,
who had been at the window.

“A fiddlestick!” responded Maurice lightly. “Now for thrilling
mountain scenery, with revolutionary bands thrown in gratis!”

The train was now entering the mountains, and the four young people
established themselves at the corridor window, which presented the
most extensive views, but Mrs Smith refused to leave the compartment.
Emathia possessed the most brutal and savage scenery in the world, she
declared, and it made her shiver even to look at it. She would
endeavour to forget it, and if a French novel and slumber are aids to
forgetfulness, it was not long before she did so. The prospect from
her side of the carriage was certainly not inspiriting, since it was
limited to the rocky cliff in which the track had been blasted out,
but on the other side there was something like a view, as Maurice
said. From the very edge of the line, dark woods sank down, down, to
depths which the eye could not penetrate, rising again on the other
side of the valley to heights behind which the sun was already
setting, at barely five o’clock on a summer afternoon. In one or two
places there was a glimpse of foaming water, but generally the woods
alone were visible. They made her feel weird, Zoe said; it was like an
enchanted forest. She did not mind going through them in the train,
but to think of venturing into them on foot was enough to make the
bravest heart quail.

“We ought to reach the great viaduct which crosses the river
presently,” said Wylie. “I believe the line winds so much just there
that from this end of the train you see the engine and the first half
apparently at right angles with you as it enters on the bridge.”

“There it is!” cried Eirene presently. She and Zoe were sitting on the
seat below the window, Maurice and Wylie standing behind them. They
all looked out eagerly to see the famous bridge, and withdrew their
heads again laughing, with ruffled hair, for in this narrow valley the
wind was strong. Eirene drew back to adjust a hairpin, the two men
were laughing at one another’s dishevelled aspect, and only Zoe was
still looking out when that happened which she would never forget,
though she could not determine exactly the sequence of the several
events. In anticipation of the appearance of the head of the train,
she was keeping her eyes fixed upon the bridge, when the end nearest
her rose suddenly in the air, suddenly and, as it seemed, quietly. She
had opened her mouth to cry, “Look at the bridge!” when the words were
drowned by the sound of an explosion, which must have been
simultaneous with the upheaval, but seemed to follow at a perceptible
interval. The train rocked and staggered, the glass from the windows
and lamps shivered and fell in showers with a curious tinkling noise,
Maurice and Wylie were thrown violently across the corridor. Zoe found
herself and Eirene on their feet, gazing at one another with dilated
eyes, heard Wylie shout to them angrily to sit down, had a vague idea
that the train had left the metals and was trying to climb the
mountain--or what was the meaning of those agonised jerks which felt
like earthquakes? She knew that she was saying something foolish--“the
hill above the line was not quite so steep here, was it?”--but the
words were frozen on her lips. The floor was slipping away beneath
her, the place where the window had been was somehow rising to the
roof, then there came a great crash, a sensation of falling through
space, and all was silence.




 CHAPTER V.
 THE JEWEL-CASE.

When Zoe came to herself, the first sensation of which she was
conscious was a stinging taste in her mouth, the next the dark woods
cutting the sky opposite her. She cried out weakly, and closed her
eyes to shut out the sight.

“That’s right!” said a voice. “How do you feel?”

“All smashed up,” she murmured feebly.

“Nonsense! Stretch out your arms!” The tone was so peremptory that she
obeyed mechanically. “Now your feet,” and she gave two spasmodic
kicks. “You’re all right,” said the voice, which was gradually
becoming familiar. “A little more brandy?”

“Oh, no!” said Zoe in disgust, wriggling away from the offered flask,
and discovering that her head was supported on Wylie’s arm. “I’m quite
well now. Did I faint? Where’s Maurice? Oh!” as recollection rushed
upon her, “is Maurice safe?”

“He’s all right, helping to dig out your sister. We could hear her
voice, and I left him to get her out, while I brought you up here. Now
I am going to get you something for a pillow, and then I shall leave
you.”

Raising herself with difficulty on her elbow, Zoe found that she was
lying on a steep bank of stones and rubble, sparsely covered with
grass. Below her was the wrecked train, lying on its side on the
slope. Men were standing on the sides of the carriages and dragging
others through the holes where the windows had been, or thrusting
aside distorted pieces of iron and masses of splintered wood. Some of
the rescued were sitting on the slope bemoaning themselves, or
stanching wounds in head or hands with their handkerchiefs; others
were being carried towards a tree at one side, under which a man in
his shirt-sleeves was bending over a woman lying on the ground. Thus
much Zoe was able to see before Wylie ran up the bank again with a
small box, which had been thrown aside out of the way of the rescuers,
in his hand.

“I’ll put this under your head,” he said hastily, “and with that big
stone at your feet you won’t slip down the bank. Just shut your eyes
and lie quiet, and the shock will soon pass off.”

“Can’t I come down and help?” asked Zoe.

“No, no. Keep out of the way, that’s the best thing you can do. I’ll
call you when we get your sister out.”

Zoe disobeyed him only so far as to watch the men at work on the train
until she had distinguished Maurice, and then lay down, unable to
repress a hysterical little laugh at the thought of Wylie’s sending
him to the rescue of a stranger while she was left to the care of
others. It was not long before she heard herself summoned.

“Miss Smith, we are taking your sister to the doctor. She is hurt, but
I hope not badly. You would like to come?”

Rising unsteadily to her feet, she was glad to accept the aid of
Wylie’s hand down the slope. Eirene was half unconscious, and moaned
when she was touched, and Maurice and Wylie carried her to the
improvised field-hospital, where a French surgeon, who had fortunately
been among the passengers, was giving such aid as he could to the
injured. One or two ladies who had escaped unhurt were tearing up
their dust-cloaks for temporary bandages, and behind the tree at the
back lay several quiet forms, reverently covered with rugs and
macintoshes hastily collected. Zoe shivered at the sight, but the
doctor had no time to waste. Discovering that Eirene’s most serious
injury was a dislocated shoulder, he reduced the dislocation by rough
and ready means, and bound her arm tightly into place, then told Zoe
to take her away, since cuts and contusions must await a more
opportune moment for treatment. Maurice came forward to help her, and
whispered to the doctor, who nodded vigorously.

“By all means get her to bed as soon as possible. An emotional
temperament--I have observed it myself--fever very likely to
supervene. I will see that she goes with the first batch of wounded.”

But as Maurice and Wylie laid her gently on the slope, Eirene
struggled into a sitting position. “My jewel-case!” she screamed. “My
jewel-case! where is it?”

“It must be in the carriage still,” said Maurice. “We shall come upon
it.”

“Bring it to me!” she cried angrily. “I must have it.”

“It will be found,” said Zoe soothingly, “but no one has seen it yet.
Don’t worry yourself, Eirene; it will be all right.” Her tone had
grown a little impatient, for she had gathered from Maurice’s whisper
to the doctor that Mrs Smith was among the killed, and Eirene had not
even asked after her.

“It is lost, stolen!” cried Eirene. “I threw it out of the window when
the train began to turn over. Offer a reward, quickly--a million
francs, anything!”

“Your wealth must be greater than your prudence, mademoiselle, or you
would hardly carry such valuables about with you,” remarked the doctor
drily. Like every one else in her immediate vicinity, he had been
attracted by Eirene’s shriek.

“They are all I have in the world. My jewels are everything to me,”
she cried wildly. “I will not leave this place without them. I will
search the line on my hands and knees. It is marked ‘E. E. Smith’--a
small box covered with leather, with brass ornaments. Has no one seen
it?”

Zoe gave a gasp, and seized Maurice’s arm, pointing to the box as it
lay neglected high up the slope. The next moment he had fetched it
down, and between tears and laughter she restored it to its owner.

“Oh, Eirene, I am so sorry! Captain Wylie brought it me for a pillow,
and I hadn’t an idea what it was. But when you mentioned brass
ornaments, I remembered how uncomfortable the handle was. Now it’s all
right, isn’t it?”

Eirene lay down, almost fainting, but gripping the box, while the
bystanders dispersed, whispering and muttering, and much disappointed
with this tame conclusion. Communication had now been established with
the nearest station--a mere hill-hamlet, compared with which the
village where the Roumi soldiers were to be quartered was a town--and
presently a trolley came down the line with an official and several
workmen. They brought the news that help had been telegraphed for from
the larger station, but that it was not likely to amount to more than
an engine and open trucks, which might not arrive that night. It was,
therefore, for the passengers to choose whether they would remain
where they were, or walk back to the small station in company with the
men in charge of the trolley. The purpose which this was intended to
serve was quickly evident, for several heavy cases were extracted with
great difficulty from a locked van, which had been specially guarded
since the accident, and piled upon it. The doctor obtained leave for
Eirene and three other passengers, whose injuries were not so severe
as to prevent their sitting up, to use the chests as seats, and they
were lifted to their places as gently as possible, Eirene gripping the
jewel-case fast in her uninjured hand. The passengers who chose to
walk were asked to keep close to the trolley, so as to form a guard,
headed by the two armed officials who were in charge of the treasure.
Owing to the prohibition of the import of arms, Wylie had sent his
regulation weapons by sea, and though both he and Maurice had brought
sporting guns (which it had cost them much time and trouble to get
through the customs), these could not yet be extricated from the
confused heap of luggage in the train. Wylie had a miniature revolver,
from which a long experience of danger had taught him never to
separate himself, and he showed it reassuringly to Zoe as they set
out, lighted in the gathering twilight by the fires kindled on the
banks for the passengers who chose to remain by the train.

“Why, what is there to be afraid of?” she asked him. “Wolves?”

“Possibly; but I didn’t mean to frighten you, only to calm your fears
if you had any.”

“Wylie doesn’t follow the bewildering changes of your mind,” said
Maurice, who was carrying Zoe’s dressing-bag, the only thing they had
been able to bring. “You professed to be afraid of the forest when you
were perfectly safe in the train, but now you seem to think it rather
a lark to be walking through it at this particularly ghostly hour.”

“Oh no, I know what you mean,” cried Zoe, “the people who destroyed
the bridge! You do think it was done on purpose, then?”

“Dynamite, undoubtedly,” returned Wylie, “worked by one of those
clockwork arrangements which are timed to go off at a certain moment.
This one went off about forty seconds too soon. The guard actually saw
the bridge blow up, and had just time to put the brakes on hard. If
the train had been on the bridge, as the fiends who laid the dynamite
intended, not a soul would have escaped.”

“I saw it too,” said Zoe, with a shudder. “And who do you think it
was?”

“Why, the Thracian revolutionaries we heard of from the sergeant, of
course,” said Maurice. “The troops had been carefully got out of the
way by a false alarm, and the bridge was left defenceless. It was very
neatly arranged. They were saying at the train that all these Thracian
bands are under the orders of the Bishop of Tatarjé, who is a great
pan-Slavist.”

“But what good would it have done them to destroy a whole train-load
of people who had nothing to do with their troubles?” said Zoe. “Were
they after the treasure?”

“Very likely,” said Wylie. “Money means more dynamite and more rifles.
But even if it had all gone down into the river and been lost, the
moral effect on Europe of the destruction of a train like this would
have been immense. It would have called attention to their grievances,
and advertised them as heroes who stick at nothing.”

“And you think they may be hiding in the trees now?”

“No, since their blow failed, I should imagine they are off
double-quick march to some other part of the country, so as to
establish a serviceable alibi. But even if they were here, I don’t
think we look worth attacking.”

“We are a disreputable lot,” said Maurice, trying to scan his torn
hands and ragged clothes in the twilight. “You will have to doctor our
wounds and bruises when we get to the station, Zoe. She is one of
those people who pride themselves on travelling with a specimen of
every conceivable kind of thing that may possibly be wanted,” he
explained to Wylie, “so she is sure to have plaster.”

“Plenty in my luggage, but only a little here,” said Zoe, “so we must
use it economically. I suppose,” she added nervously, “you don’t think
they may be lying in wait somewhere in front to get the treasure?”

“Not a bit of it,” said Wylie. “We are prepared for them now, and they
know it. And to-morrow, I understand, the treasure is to be sent on at
once with an armed escort. If I may offer a piece of advice, it is
that the jewellery your sister is so anxious about should be sent on
too.”

“She will never part with it,” said Zoe, with conviction. “Oh, don’t
look at me as if I could persuade her. If I had the least influence
over her, do you think she would be carrying it about with her as she
does?”

“We are almost strangers to her, you see,” explained Maurice rather
lamely. “We can’t expect to have much influence.”

“Well, it seems to me to be distinctly a case for the exercise of
fraternal authority. Make him speak seriously to her, Miss Smith, and
not shove off all the disagreeable things on you. I’m afraid you’ll
have a bad time breaking the news of Mrs Smith’s death to your sister.
By the bye, she was not your aunt, was she?”

“Oh no, no relation to us whatever,” said Zoe.

“We never met her before this journey,” added Maurice.

“That was what I said to myself when I saw you first,” said Wylie to
Zoe. “Then her being named Smith was merely a coincidence?”

“Purely a coincidence,” said Zoe emphatically, and Maurice added, “You
must think us a queer set.”

“Not at all,” returned Wylie politely and falsely.

“Oh, but you must!” cried Zoe. “I am sure, if we met ourselves, we
should think we were the most extraordinary family that ever lived.
But how can we help it?”

“One’s family is one of the things that have to be lived down,” said
Wylie, with the kindest intentions, and went on to give instances in
point from the history of people he had known, while Maurice and Zoe
wished vainly that they could explain the true state of
affairs--vainly, for how could they betray the history of their
acquaintance with Eirene without her consent?

“It’s awful, Maurice,” lamented Zoe afterwards. “What will he think
when he sees us separate at Therma, or if he ever meets her without
us, or us without her? It will seem as if we had deliberately deceived
him all along.”

But this was after they had arrived at the village, and accepted
without enthusiasm the only quarters available. The Han, or inn, might
have served satisfactorily to accommodate one or two sportsmen who did
not mind roughing it, but now, invaded by a crowd of tired, hungry
travellers, many of them bringing nothing but the clothes they wore,
its resources were hopelessly overtaxed. The railway officials,
securing Wylie, whose experience they recognised, as an ally, set to
work to house their charges as best they could. The long loft which
formed the upper storey of the inn was devoted to the ladies, and all
the beds in the establishment--which were not above suspicion--were
transferred thither, while rugs and sacks were requisitioned to
provide couches for the men below. Bowls of coarse porridge, and
platters of hastily boiled mutton, were forthcoming after a time, meal
and a sheep having been commandeered from the neighbourhood, but there
were no knives and forks, and spoons quickly ran short. Wylie shared
in the abuse heaped upon the railway management, who ought, it
appeared, to have provided a perfectly equipped hotel, with
restaurant, hair-dressing saloons, bathrooms, and a large stock of
borrowable clothing, at this particular spot, but he went on his way
with a polite smile and unbending courtesy, arranging for breakfast on
the morrow. Bare-footed, untidy girls, called in to help, fell over
one another on the ladder-like staircase, or stood saucer-eyed to
watch the “European” ladies and gentlemen, seated most uncomfortably
on the floor, and grumbling over what seemed to Emathian minds a
highly luxurious banquet. Hot water was absolutely unattainable, even
if there had been cans to contain it, and the brushes and combs of
such passengers as possessed them were passed from hand to hand for
the benefit of the less fortunate. Zoe was happy in escaping early
from the turmoil, for being in charge of Eirene, she was allowed to
take her upstairs as soon as a bed could be prepared, and Maurice
brought them a bowl of broth--or rather, water in which the mutton had
been boiled--with pieces of meat floating in it. Eirene would eat
nothing. While they sat outside the Han, waiting for the loft to be
got ready, she had raised her head suddenly from Zoe’s shoulder, as if
waking from a stupor, and demanded--

“Where is Evdotia Vladimirovna? I have not seen her.”

“I--I think she stayed behind, at the bridge,” stammered Zoe.

“Is she wounded? She would not have left me to you. What is the matter
with her? Is she dead?”

Zoe struggled to say something, and failed, and Eirene read the truth
from her broken accents.

“She is dead, then?” she said. “And I made her come with me!”

She would say nothing more, and the tears for which Zoe hoped would
not come. Eirene allowed herself to be helped upstairs, and lay down
obediently, but not to sleep. When the noise and confusion that
reigned throughout the inn had at last subsided, Zoe was roused by
hearing her voice. Sometimes she spoke in French or English, sometimes
in an unknown tongue, which Zoe thought must be Scythian, rambling on
and on, and moaning pitifully. Once she called out for her jewel-case,
and Zoe, fearing that the other passengers would be disturbed, rose
and brought it to her, leaving it on the bed, so that she might be
sure it was safe. She held long conversations with some one,
apparently urging some course of action, and Zoe guessed that her mind
was recurring to the difficulty she had experienced in inducing Mrs
Smith to accompany her on her quest, whatever it was. The delirium had
passed off in the morning, but Eirene remained weak and feverish, and
Zoe welcomed the appearance of the doctor, who came up from the scene
of the accident with the rest of his patients in the emergency train
as soon as it was light. Bustle was everywhere again, and the
officials and Wylie had their hands full in producing order out of
chaos. The most serious cases among the injured were to be sent back
to Tatarjé, while those who were only slightly wounded, and the
unhurt, were to proceed by road as fast as carriages could be provided
to convey them, following the old route through the mountains which
had preceded the railway, crossing the river by a Roman bridge at some
distance lower down, and rejoining the line at the nearest station on
the other side, where a train would be waiting to take them on to
Therma. This would have been the natural course for Maurice and Zoe to
follow, but there was Eirene to consider, and Zoe felt no surprise
when the doctor remarked airily--

“She must not be moved, of course. A few days’ perfect rest and
freedom from strain is necessary. You will be able to renew the
dressings, mademoiselle, and I will leave you sufficient material.
Your interesting sister is in no danger, but she will certainly not be
fit to travel for a week.”

“Of course we must stay and look after her,” said Maurice, when he
heard the verdict. “We can’t leave her here alone.”

This was Zoe’s own opinion, but for some reason Maurice’s ready
agreement displeased her. “She has no claim on us whatever,” she said,
rather tartly. “She simply tacked herself on to us.”

“What a low thing to say!” cried Maurice, really angry. “And the poor
little girl in such trouble!”

“Of course she’s in trouble, but whose fault is it? You may say what
you like, but you know you’d be horribly, frightfully angry if I went
running about Europe and hooked myself on to a strange man and his
sister.”

“That would be quite different. I mean, it would be quite different
with strangers. She had sense enough to pick out us. At any
rate”--Maurice had a dim idea that there was something not quite
conclusive about his argument--“we ought to be very thankful that she
did.”

“We? Scarcely. But I think she ought,” snapped Zoe, and having
permitted herself this licence, set to work to atone for it. “Don’t
look so righteously angry, Maurice. I never dreamed for a moment of
leaving her alone here; only it struck me all at once how different it
would have seemed to you if I had been in her place. Don’t be afraid;
I’ll be her guide, philosopher, and friend as long as she’ll let me,
and hand her over to her parents and guardians a reformed character,
when they turn up at last.”

“Yes, one forgets that,” said Maurice, with what Zoe felt was
unnecessary solemnity, and she turned away a little hastily.

“Is she going to come between Maurice and me?” she asked herself. “No,
that she can’t do unless I let her. She isn’t a bad child, really--for
a child, always seeing how far she can go, and half frightened at the
things she does, and expecting other people to take the
responsibility. I do wonder who she really is.”

“Good morning,” said Wylie, meeting her. “You look none the worse for
your adventures, I’m glad to see. I met the doctor just now. Horribly
bad luck for you to be fixed here. I hope you are not anxious about
your sister?”

“The doctor says it is only rest she needs, thank you. I suppose this
is ‘good-bye’?” noticing that he was equipped for a journey.

“Not exactly. I’m only going down with your brother to see if we can
disinter your family luggage from the wreck. Er--I found I was more
knocked about than I thought,” as Zoe looked at him in surprise, “and
I thought a--a little rest wouldn’t do me any harm, so I’m staying on
too--if you don’t mind, that is?”

“Why should I mind?” asked Zoe coolly. “I think it will be very nice
for my brother to have a companion, as I shall be so much taken up. I
hope you are not seriously hurt?”

“Oh no, no--nothing at all,” he assured her. “I am sending a message
to my friend not to expect me just yet. Oh, by the bye, they will soon
be packing off the treasure. What about your sister’s jewel-case? It
has been a good deal talked of already, and the villagers are prepared
to regard your party as possessed of illimitable wealth. I really
think we should be safer without it.”

“I’ll speak to her at once,” said Zoe, as she mounted the stair. By
way of proceeding in a gentle and diplomatic manner, she began by
telling Eirene that Wylie was remaining with them, which seemed to
fill her with compunction.

“I have not deserved this fidelity,” she said feebly, “for I have
never shown him any special distinction. But he shall not go
unrewarded. Oh,” meeting Zoe’s astonished and rather indignant eyes,
“I forgot; he does not know. But his intention is kind.”

“He thinks you had better send your jewel-case on with the treasure,
and get it placed in safety,” said Zoe bluntly, unreasonably irritated
by Eirene’s assumption that Wylie was staying on her account.

“Never!” said Eirene decisively. “I won’t part with it.”

“Oh, very well. Every one is talking about it, and the revolutionaries
are sure to hear. Then they will come and besiege the inn, and you
will have to give it up.”

“Not while I live.”

“Well, if you think Maurice and Captain Wylie--or any one--would
sacrifice the lives of a whole houseful of people just for the sake of
your jewels, I don’t.”

Eirene wavered a little. “What does Maurice say?” she asked.

“He thinks, as I do, that if you are our sister, your brother’s wishes
ought to have some effect on you.”

“If I only knew they would be safe!” sighed Eirene.

“Why, they are sure to be safe. You will be given a receipt for them,
I expect, and then the railway people would be responsible.”

“If I thought that----!” Eirene was still gripping the box. “Zoe, will
you find out at once? If the railway people will guarantee the safety
of the case, I will entrust it to them.”

Much relieved by this reasonable attitude, Zoe went downstairs again,
found the official in charge of the treasure, obtained all possible
assurances from him, and returned to Eirene, who had opened the
jewel-case, and with reluctant fingers was rearranging its more
obvious contents--the trinkets which, as she had told the French lady,
had belonged to her mother--in their proper places.

“Take it quickly, before I change my mind,” she said, locking it
hastily.




 CHAPTER VI.
 A TRAP.

The week’s stay at the Han was drawing to a close. Twice the train
from “Europe” had deposited its passengers at the station, and they
had been sent on by road, as those of the wrecked train had been, to
rejoin the line on the other side of the river. Gangs of navvies were
at work on the repairs to the bridge, and the passage of
construction-trains kept the station staff busy. Maurice and Wylie had
extricated as much as possible of their possessions and those of the
girls from the pile of damaged and partially plundered luggage (for
the navvies had enjoyed first choice) rescued from among the
_débris_, and the village carpenter found himself overworked, or so
he asserted, with orders for making new boxes and repairing others.
The party at the inn had been increased by the addition of Haji Ahmad,
a trusted Roumi servant of Wylie’s friend Captain Palmer, who had been
sent to make himself generally useful, which he did. Poor Mrs Smith
had been buried in the neglected churchyard, a ragged and dirty priest
hurrying through a service which seemed little more intelligible to
himself than to the three English who listened, and displaying an
indecent keenness as to the fees due to him.

“Eirene,” said Zoe, on the fifth day of their stay, “Maurice wanted me
to ask you what you would like put on the tombstone. He has found a
man who can carve letters, and he would like to make sure that it is
properly done before we leave.”

“‘Evdotia Vladimirovna’--nothing else,” replied Eirene, after a
moment’s reflection. “Some day I shall build a memorial church here,
to commemorate her fidelity, but it is not the time for that yet.”

Zoe wondered silently whether the poor lady might not have preferred a
peaceful life to this honoured death, and Eirene caught her look. “You
know that she was not really my aunt?” she said doubtfully.

“I have thought it might be so,” returned Zoe.

“She was my mother’s--companion,” said Eirene, hesitating over the
word, “and then she was one of my governesses. I was obliged to tell
her what I meant to do, and she could not let me come alone. I said I
should go without her, but of course I could not have done it. I knew
she would come sooner than that. And I told her what to do, and she
really tried to do it. You don’t know how cunningly I laid my plans!”
with sudden enthusiasm. “I made use of my father’s steward to take
passages to America for us from Havre, and get American passports for
us as Mrs Silas Lapham and Miss Philadelphia Lapham, and to transfer
money in that name to a bank in New York. He is a Jew, and I knew that
however heavily I bribed him to silence, he would betray me if he
found himself in danger, so I let him think he was wholly in my
confidence, and yet I never trusted him at all. Through an English
merchant with whom my father had dealings, I got these English
passports, and then all was clear. We had been staying at a French
watering-place, and we left it in our proper characters and embarked
on the Nord Express. Our maids went on unsuspiciously with the luggage
to--where we used to live, but Evdotia Vladimirovna and I had left the
train at the first stopping-place and returned to Paris. A duplicate
set of luggage was sent through to Havre in the name of Lapham, to
make further confusion, while we, with entirely different luggage,
took tickets for the Orient Express as Mrs and Miss Smith. I knew that
if Levinssohn betrayed us, he could only direct pursuit to Havre,
where the false luggage would be stopped; but it would be some days
before they would suspect we were not coming that way at all, and by
that time our traces in Paris would be lost. I was foolish in being so
frightened at Vindobona, for it was most unlikely that my precautions
should have failed, but it was terrible to think that after such a
bold stroke I might be dragged back.”

“Well, I only hope you had a good reason for it all,” was Zoe’s
unsympathetic rejoinder. Eirene looked offended.

“Arrangements were proposed for me which I could not possibly accept,”
she said, with much dignity. “My reasons were absolutely valid, as you
will acknowledge if I ever explain them to you. I should like to
justify myself by doing so now, but it is out of the question,
unless---- Zoe,” she broke off suddenly, “it occurs to me sometimes
that you and Maurice may not be what you seem. You also--I mean, you
yourselves--may be travelling _incognito_. If it was so----?”

The possibilities of the situation flew through Zoe’s mind as Eirene’s
voice ceased. If she were to make a bargain--to exchange her secret
for Eirene’s? But the secret was not hers alone, but Maurice’s, and
Wylie was still in ignorance of it. Besides, what if Eirene were
really the spy she had at first imagined her, and this was a bold bid
on her part for success in her nefarious schemes? Zoe’s decision was
taken in an instant. “You mustn’t be so fanciful,” she said. “Maurice
and I have lived the most unromantic life you can imagine. He is
really an English country gentleman, as he has told you. We do really
live in a nice, square, ugly, old Georgian house, with good grounds.
When we are ambitious we call them the park. We have a good many
tenants, who are a continual bother through wanting things done for
them and not paying their rents. We are exactly like our neighbours,
except that we have both been to college.” A prudential instinct, for
which she commended herself, restrained her from mentioning the Gold
Medal, though she had already exulted in Wylie’s undisguised
astonishment when he was made acquainted with Maurice’s poetical fame.

Eirene sighed. “I am so sorry,” she said. “I had fancied---- There is
something so striking about your brother--a mingling of strength and
gentleness and carelessness--no, that is the wrong word; _insouciance_
is what I mean--that I could not help hoping he was really noble.”

The temptation to reveal the truth was so overwhelming that Zoe took
refuge in a highly moral tone. “You have such a horribly snobbish way
of looking at things,” she said severely, “thinking whether people are
noble instead of whether they are nice. Maurice and Captain Wylie are
English gentlemen, and an English gentleman is the equal of any one in
the world.”

“And an English lady?” demanded Eirene smartly.

“Superior to any one in the world, I should think, judging by the way
in which foreign royalties employ English governesses,” retorted Zoe.

“I had an English governess,” said Eirene, closing her eyes languidly.
“She was very highly connected, she said so; and she believed that one
of the foresters--gamekeepers, you say?--was in love with her. She
used to drop her handkerchief for him to pick up.”

“Poor thing! No doubt she wanted some consolation--or perhaps she was
going crazy,” said Zoe. “I expect you led her a life.”

“You consider me very unamiable?” asked Eirene curiously. “Tell me,
then; what do you think of me, honestly?”

“I don’t think you are unamiable really, but you seem to think of no
one but yourself, and you are always thinking of yourself. You told me
to say what I thought.”

“I know; I suppose it is true. You consider me selfish. Well, I will
try to improve. And to begin, I beg you will go to Maurice and ask him
from me to take you for a long walk. I have kept you too much with
me.”

“Oh, nonsense!” said Zoe, laughing; “it’s very nice here. I’m not
going to leave you all alone.”

“I insist that you go. And don’t fear my being dull. I have much to
do, for I must mend my skirt before I put it on to-morrow. Pray leave
me your workbox.”

“Why, I never noticed it,” said Zoe, turning to the skirt as it hung
on the wall. Five or six inches of braid were hanging in a loop. “But
I’ll do it for you in a minute.”

“No,” said Eirene stiffly, “you are not my maid.”

“Then we’ll do it together, if you are so proud. But you can’t work
with one hand in a sling.”

“It is only the left, and it will suffice to hold the work,” persisted
Eirene. “Go!” she cried, with sudden anger. “I will not have you
criticising my untidy stitches. I will do it by myself, if it takes me
till dark.”

Shrugging her shoulders, Zoe took her hat and left the room. When she
returned at dusk, after a glorious walk through the hills, Eirene had
accomplished her task, and was trying the skirt on. Zoe looked at it
in surprise.

“Why, how funny it looks!” she said. “You must have puckered it
dreadfully. It sticks out in such a queer way above the hem. Let me
pull it down.”

She knelt to try and twitch the folds into place, but Eirene pulled
them away pettishly.

“How tiresome you are, Zoe! It will look all right. I have put in some
weights to keep it down better. If you don’t call attention to it,
nobody will notice, and it will fall perfectly when I have worn it a
day or two.”

“Well, I must say I don’t admire your tailoring,” said Zoe, rising
from her knees. “You must have put in too many weights. Your tailor
would simply break his heart if he saw that skirt. I believe I could
have done it better, though I don’t profess to be great at sewing.”

“I have arranged it as I like it,” said Eirene, with so much dignity
that her companion dropped the subject, though the ill-hung skirt was
an eyesore to her all the next day, when Eirene came downstairs and
was escorted on a short walk through the village. On the following day
they left the Han to resume their interrupted journey, but intending
to spend a night at the station on the other side of the river, lest
Eirene should be over-tired by the long drive. They took only their
hand-luggage with them in the carriage, leaving the larger boxes to
follow with those of the passengers who would be due to join the train
the next morning. The whole population of the village seemed to have
turned out to see them start, from the priest to the most slipshod
drudge at the inn, and Zoe flattered herself that they presented an
imposing appearance, with Haji Ahmad, armed to the teeth, on the box
beside the driver. The carriage itself, a nondescript vehicle of the
victoria species, stood much in need of a visit to the coachbuilder’s,
but it was large enough to allow of Eirene’s being made comfortable
with cushions, and Wylie gave it as his mature opinion that, with
reasonable care on the driver’s part, it ought to hold out until the
end of the day. The road did not lead through the dark forests of
evergreen oak, but through much more cheerful beechwoods, and the
scenery was less savage than that in the river-gorge. It was just like
a picnic, Zoe declared, and she only wished they could finish their
journey to Therma in this way instead of by train.

About noon they stopped to change horses, and ate their lunch in a
rickety shelter of poles and vines attached in lean-to fashion to the
post-station. A little beyond this the road divided, presenting a
fairly steep ascent on the right, and a more gradual descent on the
left. The driver took the road to the right without hesitation, and
Maurice and Wylie and Haji Ahmad got out to make it easier for the
horses. Maurice walked by the side of the carriage, chatting with the
girls, but Wylie and the servant fell behind, and it seemed to Zoe
that they were talking earnestly. When the top of the hill was
reached, showing a prospect of further hills, the road through which
was barely distinguishable, Wylie went forward and spoke sharply to
the driver, using a jargon of his own invention of broken Thracian
helped out with Roumi and Arabic words, in which he had managed to
make himself understood at the Han. The driver answered at first only
by a broad stare and a look of bewilderment, but presently his face
cleared, and he poured forth a torrent of words, gesticulating
vehemently with his whip. The explanation he offered seemed to satisfy
Wylie, though Haji Ahmad still looked uneasy as he climbed to his
place. As soon as Wylie was in the carriage again, Zoe asked him what
had passed.

“Haji Ahmad thought we were taking the wrong road,” he answered
lightly, “but the driver says this is shorter than the other, and the
landlord told him to take it in order to make the journey as short as
possible for your sister.”

“But it is much rougher,” objected Zoe.

“So I told him, but he says that he had not allowed for our stopping
for lunch, and that to go back down that long hill would lose so much
time that we shouldn’t get in till after dark, which would be no joke
on these roads. I don’t think there’s any fear of his losing himself.
As he says, it’s obvious that both roads lead to the river and the
Roman bridge, though this one goes across the hill and the other goes
round it.”

Maurice and Eirene had scarcely noticed what had been said, and under
cover of their talk and laughter Zoe ventured to ask, “But what if he
did lead us wrong?”

“I’m afraid I should be guilty of conniving at Roumi oppression, and
leave him to Haji Ahmad to deal with,” said Wylie, laughing. They went
on into the hills, the track becoming rougher as they advanced, until
Maurice wedged Eirene in with all the luggage of the party, that she
might not be thrown out. Zoe heard Wylie muttering maledictions on the
driver under his breath, and saw him casting glances alternately at
the sun and the way they had come, evidently calculating whether there
was time even now to retrace their steps. The driver was obviously
anxious to escape as soon as possible from the resentment of his
passengers, who were being rattled about like peas in a pod, for he
was driving furiously, making the dilapidated carriage bound from
hillock to hollow. Zoe looked across at Wylie, and, raising her voice,
asked if he could not tell the man to go more quietly; but before he
could turn his head, the driver had disappeared suddenly from her
view. Something whirred over the carriage, sweeping Haji Ahmad from
the box to the ground with a clatter of weapons, and the driver was in
his place again as if by magic, pulling up his horses frantically in
obedience to hoarse shouts in front. He must have ducked to avoid a
rope fastened across the road, was Zoe’s last coherent thought. The
carriage stopped violently, half across the track, and events came
with a rush. Zoe saw Maurice and Wylie spring up from their seats, saw
Maurice felled with the butt-end of a gun, and Wylie raging, furiously
helpless, in a noose which the driver had dexterously thrown over him,
pinioning his arms to his sides. Huge, hairy hands seized her and
Eirene, dragged them out and flung them roughly on the ground, while
fierce voices cursed them by saints with uncouth names. A wild
struggle was going on, and the two prostrate girls were undoubtedly in
the way, so that they were trampled upon impartially by both sides.
Zoe had an awful glimpse of Haji Ahmad, his face streaming with blood,
fighting desperately for his life, before she succeeded in dragging
herself out of the fray, to find Maurice flung aside stunned and
bleeding, and Eirene, who had fallen on her wounded arm, moaning
faintly. The mob of ruffians in dirty white kilts who were yelling and
struggling round the carriage paid no attention to her, and she crept
towards the other two.

“Don’t look that way--don’t!” cried Wylie, breaking out of the crowd
and thrusting himself between her and them--a ludicrous figure enough,
with torn coat, no hat, and arms bound tightly behind him. “That’s all
right,” as she lifted Maurice’s head. “There’s a flask in my pocket if
you can get at it. Buck up, Miss Eirene! Don’t let these fellows hear
an English girl making that noise.”

“I am not English!” cried Eirene, sitting up indignantly. “At least, I
mean---- Oh, what are they doing?” as a single awful cry of agony came
from the centre of the throng of robbers, and made Zoe almost drop the
flask.

“Don’t look, don’t look!” entreated Wylie. “That’s it, Miss Smith, try
and get a drop into his mouth. Now, Miss Eirene”--sharply--“can’t you
unfasten your brother’s collar, and hold up his head?”

“I’ll do it,” said Zoe, as Eirene touched Maurice’s tie delicately;
“you take the flask. Oh!” stopping short with trembling fingers, as a
second and feebler cry was heard.

“It’s over now, at any rate,” said Wylie, setting his lips. “Get your
brother’s head tied up quickly, before these fiends have time to
remember us. Each man is bound to give the poor wretch a stab, dead
though he may be.”

“Is it Haji Ahmad?” asked Zoe faintly, as she folded her handkerchief
into a pad.

“Yes. A Roumi need expect no mercy from these fellows. Take my
handkerchief for a bandage; it’s larger than yours. Oh, good heavens!
have you no knife or scissors that you could cut this rope with, and
give me a chance to stand up to them when they turn round?”

“In the carriage?” suggested Zoe, measuring the distance with her eye.
“Oh, Maurice has a knife, of course.”

“Leave it, leave it!” he cried quickly; “they’re coming. Stand up if
you can, Smith,” as Maurice opened his eyes feebly. “No, it’s no good.
Keep quiet.”

He stood before the girls, and it seemed to Zoe that the advancing
robbers quailed when they met his eye, and shuffled their
blood-stained yataghans out of sight, as though suddenly conscious of
the awful mass on the ground behind them.

“Can any of you speak English?” he cried.

“Me--a leetle,” said a small, slim man, pushing his way to the front.

“What do you want with us?”

“We take all you got, zen get moch money for you,” was the reply,
given with an ingratiating grin.

“So I thought. Well, I have this to say to you. You can pillage my
friend and me if you like, but you won’t lay a finger upon the ladies.
They will turn out their pockets and show you what they’ve got, and
you can take what you want.”

The interpreter turned to his friends, apparently not sorry to escape
from Wylie’s glance, and explained the terms to them. Absurd though it
seemed, the will of the bound and defenceless prisoner prevailed above
the murmurs that arose, and the interpreter undertook, on behalf of
the chief of the band, that the girls should not be searched if Wylie
would swear on the Evangelists that they had given up everything.

“Turn out your pockets, quickly,” he said to them, as two of the men
seized him, and two others dragged Maurice to his feet and propped him
against a tree.

“I won’t!” cried Eirene, her eyes flaming.

“Nonsense! you must. Didn’t you hear me promise for you?” He spoke
with difficulty, trying to turn round while his captors thrust and
pulled him about.

“I don’t care. I never gave you leave to make promises for me. If they
touch me, I’ll kill them.”

What she held in her hand neither Zoe nor Wylie could see, but the
brigands were clamouring and the interpreter insistent.

“Let me talk to her,” cried Wylie, wrenching himself, with his collar
loose and his coat hanging by one sleeve, from the hands that held
him. “Look here, Miss Eirene, you must. You are not going to expose
your sister to the risk of being searched by these fellows?”

“She can do as she likes. I won’t be searched, and I will give up
nothing.”

“Smith, make your sister behave rationally. She will have all our
blood on her head in a minute.” Maurice, held up by the two men who
were searching him, made an effort to speak, but in vain, and Eirene
turned her back on him. One of the brigands seized Zoe by the arm, and
Wylie grew desperate.

“For the last time, turn out your pockets!” he said low and fiercely
to Eirene. “If you don’t, I swear to you, on my word and honour, I’ll
get my hands loosed and do it myself.”

Eirene was cowed. A muttered “Your honour!” passed her lips, but
slowly and reluctantly she extracted from all the many pockets with
which the Vindobona tailor had provided her such spoils as struck the
brigands dumb with awe and astonishment, while Zoe looked on
stupefied. Nearly all the jewellery Eirene had exhibited in the train
seemed to be secreted about her person--pearls, rubies, emeralds,
everything except the quaint enamelled plaques which she had said she
prized most of all. There could be no doubt that before parting with
her jewel-case she had removed all its most valuable contents.

“Is that all?” asked Wylie sternly, and she drew a bracelet from under
her sleeve, and hurled it passionately on the heap at her feet.

“That is everything,” she said defiantly. “And I wish you and your
friends joy of it. Of course I knew from the first that you were in
league with them.”

“Now it is your turn,” said Wylie to Zoe, and she added to the heap a
collection which filled the brigands with indignation, noticing as she
did so that Eirene’s bracelet bore an eagle upon it--a design which
seemed in some way familiar. A shabby purse moderately filled, two
note-books, one very small, and the other large enough to require a
special pocket for its accommodation, and a serviceable
pencil-case--these were all that the robbers cared to appropriate of
her possessions, but Maurice and Wylie were despoiled of everything
their pockets contained.




 CHAPTER VII.
 A NIGHT’S LODGING.

For a minute or two the captives were left standing together while
the brigands divided the spoil, each man stowing his share away in the
bag slung knapsack-wise over his shoulder, and Wylie said hastily to
Zoe, “You had better pick up what you can of the things they have
left. Of course we shall be rescued to-morrow, but you will be more
comfortable to-night.”

Obediently Zoe gathered together various odds and ends of clothing,
one or two of Eirene’s hair-brushes, deprived of their silver backs,
and such other trifles as the cupidity or ingenuity of the brigands
saw no use for. Her note-books and writing materials, the contents of
her travelling workbox, and the little “first-aid” case on which she
prided herself, had all been seized upon as valuable spoils, and she
found herself as destitute as the most heedless traveller could
deserve to be. Eirene, brooding sullenly over her wrongs, gave her no
help in her search, and she rolled up the poor remains of their joint
possessions into a bundle and tied it round with a broken
umbrella-strap. This was only done just in time, for the brigands,
their delightful task accomplished with a good deal of squabbling and
murmuring against the decisions of the chief, had leisure to think of
their prisoners. Accompanied by two others leading the horses which
had been taken from the carriage, the interpreter came towards them.

“Behold! we beneficent beings,” he observed genially. “We furnish even
horses zat ze women may ride.”

“I fancied we provided the horses,” murmured Maurice, from his seat on
the ground.

“I won’t ride,” said Zoe quickly. “Maurice must. He can’t walk.”

“Nonsense! I can walk perfectly well,” said Maurice.

“For goodness’ sake do what they tell you,” said Wylie anxiously.
“It’s only for one night.”

“Your eyes most be blinded,” pursued the interpreter. Zoe gasped.

“He means blindfolded,” explained Maurice, as the man produced the
dirtiest handkerchief any of the captives had ever seen.

“Oh no, no!” entreated Zoe, breaking down at last. “Why, they might
take us and you in different directions, and we should never know.
I’ll shut my eyes--anything, but don’t let us be blindfolded. Do speak
to them,” she begged of Wylie. “They listen to you.”

“Pull yourself together,” he said sternly. “I should never have
suspected you of being hysterical.” The accusation told, and Zoe, with
both hands pressed to her chest, fought down the threatening sobs.
Wylie turned to the interpreter. “Look here,” he said, “the ladies are
frightened. If they think they are to be separated from their brother
they will give you a lot of trouble. Why should you blindfold them? If
you lead the horses they can’t possibly escape.”

“I know a treek----” began the interpreter airily, but here his memory
failed him; “double valuable to zat one,” he concluded hastily,
beckoning to another brigand for the rope twisted round his waist.
Cutting off a short length, he fastened one end round Wylie’s neck,
and made a loop at the other. “Ze lady may hold zat,” he said,
chuckling.

“All right,” said Wylie, checking with a glance a horrified outburst
from Zoe. “Quite mediæval, isn’t it, Miss Smith--mounted ladies
leading captive knights on foot? Lucky for me that I’m not assigned to
your sister, or she might avenge her wrongs by strangling
me--accidentally, of course.”

“Will you endure it?” demanded Eirene fiercely of Maurice, as Zoe,
trembling with indignation, submitted to be blindfolded and lifted on
one of the horses, with a rug for a saddle.

“What can’t be cured must be endured,” he responded easily. “What
would you suggest I should do?”

“Die!” she hurled at him. “I would, in your place.”

“If you really wish that, I can oblige you in a minute or two. You
have only to refuse to be blindfolded or to mount your horse. The
brigands will naturally proceed to handle you roughly, and I shall
feel bound to throw myself forward in your defence. I think I could
manage to get killed then. Wylie will be there to look after you and
Zoe, and you will be able to think well of me.”

“You say that to prevent my offering any resistance!” she said
angrily.

“Well, do you wonder that I prefer living to dying?”

“You English have no sense of honour! But I am unjust. You are not
noble; why should you prefer death to disgrace?”

At this Maurice laughed, quite unintentionally, disgusting Eirene so
much that she submitted as meekly as Zoe had done to be blindfolded
and mounted, and slipped the loop of cord over her wrist with a kind
of fierce satisfaction. After this humiliation, she thought, even Zoe
could no longer pretend that Maurice and Wylie were her equals! The
reflection pleased her, and she rode along almost contentedly,
reviewing her own past conduct and approving it, which is always a
soothing occupation. Maurice, his arm gripped by one of the brigands,
who acted both as guide and guard, trudged silently beside her horse,
which was led by another of the band. Behind them came Zoe and Wylie,
similarly escorted, and the rest of the brigands acted as front and
rear guards respectively, their moccasin-clad feet making no sound on
the stony soil. The chief had commanded perfect silence, and the
horses’ feet were muffled.

Zoe’s heart was full to bursting. The humiliations inflicted on her
brother and Wylie touched her to the quick, and she experienced on
their behalf all the indignation that they pretended not to feel. Most
incongruously, the thought of the utter absurdity of the position
afflicted her at times with an agony of mirth, and moment by moment
she was forced to choke down the inclination to scream or to break
into wild laughter. The occasional touch of Wylie’s shoulder against
her knee as he stumbled over the rough ground comforted and calmed
her, bringing a sense of the known and the ordinary into the fantastic
circumstances of the present. Once or twice she put out a timid hand
to make sure that he was still there, receiving a muttered word of
encouragement in answer, and the friendly contact enabled her to
repress the hysterical outburst she dreaded.

The journey seemed already to have lasted for hours when, after
descending a very steep hill, the interpreter announced that there was
a “reever” in front, and that Maurice and Wylie must submit to be
carried across. With one voice they assured him that they would prefer
to wade, but he explained that the chief’s solicitude for their health
was so great that he would not hear of their running the risk of
catching cold. Zoe laughed involuntarily on hearing this, and thus
relieved her feelings a little, though horribly ashamed of her lack of
sympathy. The brigands must either be adepts in the art of torture by
pin-pricks, or totally destitute of a sense of humour. Maurice
muttered that he did not see the joke, as he was carried off by two
stalwart ruffians down a sloping bank, across, and up again, but Wylie
manufactured a creditable response to her laugh. “A Gilbert and
Sullivan melodrama, isn’t it?” he said, as he also was safely conveyed
across the twenty feet or so of what must be presumed to be a rushing
torrent, from the way in which the bearers slipped and tumbled about.
The horses crossed with surprising steadiness, and the journey was
resumed, the track now trending generally up instead of down. Zoe had
lost all inclination to laugh by this time. She was cold and tired,
and stiff and miserable, and full of terrible apprehensions. If Wylie
had not been close at hand she would have defied the opinion of the
brigands and cried like a baby, but she could not break down in his
presence. He expected her to be brave, and she tried to forget her
aching limbs and think only of the literary use to which she could put
this disagreeable experience in the future. This was the way in which
she usually comforted herself in her troubles, but it did not seem
quite adequate now, and a weary sigh broke from her. The mere physical
feat of sitting her horse without pommel or stirrup seemed no longer
possible. If only she could slide to the ground and sleep!

“Keep up!” murmured Wylie. “Milosch--that’s the interpreter chap--says
it’s only a little farther.”

Once more she pulled herself together and replied cheerfully, and
before long the necessity for endurance ceased. A subtle change in the
muffled sounds surrounding her showed her that the horse was being led
into a building of some sort, and when he stopped she slid off
helplessly, much to the amusement of the brigands. Amid their
laughter, Milosch took the handkerchief from her eyes, and as soon as
she could distinguish her surroundings she found that she was
crouching close to a recently kindled fire in a low shed built of
rough stones. There was a square hole in the roof, approached by a
ladder, and the intense blackness above seemed to show that there was
a second storey of some sort. Eirene, Maurice, and Wylie were standing
near her, blinking in the firelight, and the brigands were arranging
their cloaks on the ground, or rummaging in their bags.

“Ascend up!” commanded Milosch, seizing Maurice by the arm and
pointing to the ladder. “We are charitable, we give you food when you
deposited safe in supernal regions.”

“He can’t climb that ladder with his hands tied!” cried Zoe
indignantly. “Why don’t you untie him?”

Milosch looked doubtfully at the chief, who shrugged his shoulders
contemptuously, and the cords were removed, care being taken not to
cut them. “We tie you again morning,” observed the interpreter, with
his cheerful smile. Maurice mounted the ladder, the girls followed,
and Wylie, who had lingered to secure the rugs which had served as
saddles, and request the loan of two of the brigands’ large overcoats,
brought up the rear.

“It’s nothing but a hay-loft!” cried Zoe in horrified accents.

“Excuse me,” said Wylie; “it is a loft with hay in it, which is a much
better thing, since it provides us all with beds. You’ll see, Miss
Smith. While we are waiting until our friends below send us up some
supper, we will curtain off the space at the end for you and your
sister. Smith and I will keep close to the hole, so that if the
brigands are up to any mischief in the night, they must wake us before
they can get near you.”

His tone was so cheerful and matter-of-fact that Zoe forgot her
fatigue and her fears, and held the rug for him while he tied one
corner by its fringe to a jagged nail he had discovered in the sloping
roof. The other side of the improvised curtain presented some
difficulty, for there was nothing to which to fasten it, until she
produced a stout hat-pin, which Wylie hammered into a crevice with the
heel of his boot. Eirene disapproved of this use of the hat-pin.

“You should keep it for a better purpose,” she said. “Mine I regard as
a dagger.”

“Do you mean to say that was all you had in your hand this afternoon?”
cried Zoe.

“Why not? I would have used it, as I said, and it would kill if one
struck hard enough.”

“I only wish I had known!” murmured Wylie, with heartfelt earnestness.
“There, Miss Smith! now your room is ready, you see. You can make
capital nests in the hay, and here are these two greatcoats to cover
you. It won’t be luxurious, of course, but it’s only for one----” He
broke off suddenly, and changed the subject. “Smith and I have this
other rug, so we shall do well. We shall all sleep without rocking
to-night, I think.”

“But can’t we manage to escape while the brigands are asleep?” said
Maurice, lowering his voice.

“Scarcely, since they are safe to take away the ladder, and it
wouldn’t do much good to drop down in the middle of them. The fire’s
there, you know.”

“If we were in a Henty book,” said Zoe thoughtfully, “we should cut a
hole through the roof and let ourselves down outside.”

“Unfortunately they have sentries all round,” said Wylie. “I heard the
chief placing them. The only chance would be to bribe one, and we have
nothing to do it with.”

Eirene laughed. “If you had not robbed me of my jewels this afternoon,
we should not have been destitute,” she remarked, as if to explain her
mirth.

“I shall begin to wish I had left you to be searched in Balkan
fashion,” muttered Wylie.

“Now look here, Eirene,” said Maurice, in his most elder-brotherly
tone, “just drop it. If you are our sister, you must put up with
things, and not make yourself unpleasant to our friends. You were
frightfully silly this afternoon, and might have risked all our lives,
and you ought to thank Wylie for what he did. We are all in one boat,
and it’s simply idiotic to keep up grudges in this way. Wylie is an
old campaigner, and Zoe and I are quite content to put ourselves under
his orders. You must do the same, content or not.”

He expected a fierce protest from Eirene, but the authoritative tone
seemed to cow her. “You don’t understand what my jewels were to me,”
she pleaded. “They were my whole fortune, and the pledge of my
birthright, and now I have lost them. But do not fear. You shall all
experience my gratitude in the future, and I shall bear no malice
against Captain Wylie for his excess of zeal.”

“Much obliged, I’m sure,” grunted Wylie, looking as if he thought
Eirene a little mad, and Zoe hastened to cover the indiscretion by
remarking--

“When you talk in that way, Eirene, you always make me think of Miss
Flite promising to ‘confer estates.’ Don’t you think it’s horribly
unfair, Captain Wylie, that she should be able to patronise Maurice
and me in this way?”

Wylie’s reply was fortunately anticipated by the arrival of Milosch,
who came up the ladder bearing a small collection of lumps of black
bread and very ancient cheese, and a skin bottle of water.

“Are we not beneficents?” he asked proudly, depositing his burden on
the rug. “We give you our own food!”

“That’s all very well,” said Maurice, peering down after him as he
descended. “They are eating the white bread and things we left in the
luncheon-basket.”

“How can we eat such stuff as this?” asked Zoe in dismay, for bread
and cheese were alike as hard as a rock.

“Ask them to send up a little white bread for the ladies,” suggested
Wylie; and Maurice, who was sitting nearest the hole in the floor,
obeyed, only to receive the answer, “You are our guests. We give you
our own food.”

Prudently refraining from increasing the girls’ aversion for the food
by mentioning that he had seen it collected from the sacks of the
different brigands, where it had reposed in close contact with wax,
tobacco, thread and leather for soling moccasins, rag for cleaning
guns, and other useful articles, Maurice broke off a piece of the
bread by knocking it against the roof, and tasting it, pronounced it
not so bad when you were hungry. Eirene confessed to having tasted
black bread before, when paying visits to peasants’ huts, but added
contemptuously that she had never expected to find it actually set
before her for a meal. However, since there was nothing else, they all
managed to nibble a little, and then the girls, almost asleep already,
retired behind their curtain, and were soon slumbering peacefully,
undisturbed by the loud snores from below, which showed that however
guilty the collective conscience of the brigands might be, it did not
keep them awake.

It seemed to Zoe and Eirene that they had scarcely slept at all when
they heard Maurice’s voice warning them that it was time to get up,
and they looked at one another in dismay by the light which poured
through the holes in the roof, realising that their faces were haggard
and their hair full of hay.

“I suppose we can do our hair without a looking-glass,” said Zoe. “But
do you think there is any hot water?”

The question sounded so absurdly incongruous that she was not
surprised to hear it answered by a laugh from Maurice on the other
side of the curtain. “There is a stream,” he said, “and you have leave
to wash your faces and hands. You’re lucky to have kept your
tooth-brushes, for Wylie and I have to use twigs, like the mild
Hindu.”

“I shouldn’t have thought the brigands would care for tooth-brushes,”
said Zoe.

“They don’t--for their teeth; they use them for cleaning their
guns--I’ve seen them. So be thankful, and don’t shirk the cold water.
I can even supply you with soap, for Milosch has just lent me a piece
of our own, with strict injunctions to return it, and much
self-congratulation on his generosity.”

“I think the estimable Milosch is becoming rather a bore,” said Zoe
viciously, trying to shake the hay off her skirt. “Don’t go down until
I have bandaged your head again, Maurice. I want to do it properly by
daylight.”

“Considering the want of water and light up here, wouldn’t it be as
well to do it downstairs?” suggested Maurice; and Zoe, agreeing,
presently found herself and her patient the centre of interest to the
brigands. This publicity had its advantages in that she quickly
distinguished the man to whom her first-aid case had fallen, and with
some difficulty obtained through Milosch its temporary restoration.
While the interpreter strutted about, proclaiming loudly to the
prisoners the magnanimity of their captors in thus providing them with
surgical treatment, she cut away the hair round the cut, joined the
edges with strips of plaster, and crowned Maurice with a turban of
bandages, to the intense admiration of the spectators. As soon as she
had finished, they hustled forward one of their number, who had
received a somewhat similar wound in Haji Ahmad’s last desperate
fight, and informed her, through Milosch, that he also required
medical attendance.

“Don’t touch the dirty brute,” said Wylie. “I’ll tie him up
roughly--quite good enough for him. He’s not fit for you to handle.”

“Oh no, I’ll do it,” said Zoe reluctantly, for the aspect of the
wounded man was not alluring. “I never realised before ‘how very hard
it is to be a Christian,’” she said, rather faintly, when the task was
over, and one of the men filled the rough leathern bucket with fresh
water that she might wash her hands.

“I don’t think practical Christianity need go quite so far,” said
Wylie savagely, but the chief was calling to Zoe.

“Stoyan ze Voivoda say, ‘Here, girl!’” explained Milosch, and Zoe
hesitated. The chief held out a piece of her own chocolate, with an
attempt at a smile, and after a struggle with herself, she advanced
and accepted it. It was better than the black bread and hard cheese.

“Lo, ze munificence of our autocrat!” exclaimed Milosch, striking an
attitude of reverential admiration. “He provide his guests with
sweetmeats!”

“Oh, stow that, Milosch!” entreated Maurice; “it’s getting stale.
Considering that the things are our own, it would be in better taste
to say nothing about them.”

Milosch smiled uncomfortably, and joined Stoyan for a murmured
confabulation, returning quickly to the prisoners, who were mitigating
their hard fare with minute fragments of the chocolate.

“Ze Voivoda say he not tie your hands to-day if you plight your
gentlemanly faith to try not to escape,” he said to Maurice and Wylie.
“We going into mountains, where ze women most walk, and zey need your
help.”

“To try not to escape?” said Zoe. “Oh, he means not to try to escape.
You can promise that, can’t you?”

“No, no,” said Eirene eagerly. “It is a deception, a snare--I am sure
of it. Doubtless the way is easy, and lies through villages, where it
would cause suspicion if you were seen to be fettered, and the
brigands think they will make us appear as tourists guided by them.
Surely you won’t cripple yourselves by such a promise?”

“It does seem rather insane,” agreed Maurice. “What do you say, Wylie?
We should feel pretty small if we found we had debarred ourselves from
accepting a good chance of escape.”

“I confess I don’t quite see how we are to escape with two ladies
through a country which we don’t know and the brigands do,” said
Wylie. “Even Miss Smith’s Henty heroes would have found it a large
order. But don’t think I want to back out of any unpleasantness that’s
going.”

“Well, let us split the difference,” said Maurice, “and refuse to give
our parole until we see the sort of way they take us. If it is very
bad for the girls, we can still ask to be undone.”

“You fools one and ozer,” remarked Milosch sardonically, when he heard
their decision. “Behold our slighted consideration avenge itself in
severity.”

The meaning of this cryptic sentence appeared immediately, for the
brigands, offended by the rejection of their offer, bound the two
men’s arms behind them so tightly that the cords cut into the flesh.
Wylie laughed grimly. “We can’t choose to be bound, and then complain
because they bind us,” he said. “I am sorry to be unkind, Miss Smith,
but the sooner you find the track too difficult for you, the better we
shall be pleased.”

Even now there was some time to wait before the start, while two men,
detailed for the purpose, removed the ashes of the fire and other
traces of the night’s occupation from the cattle-shed where it had
been spent, and the rest of the brigands made up their loads, those
who carried the rugs complaining angrily because the prisoners were
obviously unable to do so. Then the procession set out, with the
captives in the middle, the girls uneasily silent, frightened by the
unpleasant result of Eirene’s advice.




 CHAPTER VIII.
 THE HISTORY OF A DAY.

Eirene’s ingenious idea had been signally mistaken. This was evident
almost as soon as the little clearing in which the cattle-shed stood
had been left behind, and, indeed, it could never have been
entertained if the prisoners had been able to see their way and the
nature of their surroundings the night before. Far from being an easy
road, leading through villages, the path was a mere goat-track,
plunging into the very heart of the mountains. To the active brigands,
in their flexible moccasins, it presented no particular difficulty,
but it was full of perils and alarms for inexperienced climbers
wearing boots. At first, Zoe and Eirene shrank nervously from the gaps
in the pathway, and the narrow ledges on which they were expected to
creep round corners of rock; but the curses and threats which followed
the slightest hesitation soon drove them on in blind terror. The
brigands were worse than the mountain. Realising that Maurice and
Wylie were helpless, the girls maintained sufficient resolution not to
appeal to them, even by a glance, as they stumbled painfully up the
track, their arms tortured by the cords. Not only curses, but blows,
were showered on them whenever they missed their footing; but the
treatment meted out to the girls was what they found hardest to bear.
At last, when Zoe slipped and almost fell, and the nearest brigand’s
grimy paw clutched her and shook her savagely, Wylie could stand it no
longer.

“Smith, we must give our parole!” he called to Maurice. “Your sisters
can’t get on alone. Here, you interpreter, tell them we’ll promise not
to try to escape.”

A halt was called, and a good deal of discussion ensued among the
brigands. There was an evident disposition to allow Maurice and Wylie
to bear the consequences of their refusal to the bitter end, but the
men who were carrying the rugs objected, and so did the two who were
charged with seeing to the girls’ safety. It was unreasonable, they
pointed out with much cogency, to expect them to be bothered with
these troublesome women and their parcels, when the task could be
imposed upon their natural protectors, and the plea commended itself
at length to the rest. While Milosch delivered an oration on the
unsurpassed kindness of the brigands in allowing the captives to
change their minds, the chief cut the cords with his knife, and
ordered an immediate advance. Chafing his numbed wrists, Wylie joined
Zoe.

“We may have prevented you from escaping!” she said miserably.

“Not a bit of it. At least, if you see any chance of escape here in
these atrocious hills, I must say I don’t. Take my arm, won’t you? the
path is wider just here. Oh, I say”--he had caught sight of tears in
her eyes--“please don’t! You’re not fagged out yet?”

“It’s--not that,” came in a series of gasps. “It’s seeing you--and
Maurice--knocked about--and not being--able to do--anything. I
hate--being a woman.”

“It’s all in the day’s work,” with discreet evasiveness. “Come, now,
make up your mind you’re campaigning--‘climbing the Afghan
mountain-track,’ you know.”

“In the Khoord-Cabul disaster?” with the ghost of a smile.

“What a cheerful mind you have! But after all, the captives were
rescued that time, so it’s a good omen. There! that’s right,” as Zoe
stumbled and saved herself by catching at him. “Don’t make us feel
that our tremendous sacrifice was in vain. I’m afraid your sister
hasn’t forgiven me yet. She refused my help so decidedly just now that
I had no choice but to leave her to your brother.”

“She has rather strained ideas of honour,” said Zoe hesitatingly, “and
I think she imagines you lead Maurice wrong. You see, it was you who
offered to give the parole, and I suppose that sends you down in her
estimation.”

“Well, it’s a good fault, at any rate--too keen a sense of honour. We
English are too ready, no doubt, to think that because a thing is a
compromise it must be right. Your sister will be a fine woman when her
angles are a little rubbed off, if she sticks to her creed.”

“But she doesn’t stick to it in little things!” broke out Zoe
involuntarily. “Oh, I oughtn’t to have said that!” she cried in
distress, realising how her speech must sound from Wylie’s standpoint.
“We have been brought up so differently, you know; she is always
surprising us.”

“It was rather an experiment bringing her on a trip of this kind,
wasn’t it? Take my hand across here. I mean, some people are all right
as long as everything goes well, and they have all their own things
about them; but trouble or strangeness of any kind seems to bring all
their rough edges to light. Of course, she only wants to knock about
a bit--that’ll make all the difference,” he added hastily.

“I--I can’t explain all the circumstances,” said Zoe, in some
confusion, “but it seemed the only thing we could do, to have her with
us. And she really means to be sisterly, I am sure. It’s only that she
doesn’t quite understand things. And we must all sink or swim
together, of course.”

“Quite so; and I hope I may be considered a brother in that particular
sense. You wouldn’t all make your escape, and leave me in the hands of
these fellows, would you?”

“Do you think it likely?” asked Zoe indignantly. “And I don’t think we
should have much chance of escaping without you, either. Oh,” lowering
her voice, “do tell me why you suddenly changed your mind about our
being rescued? At first, you said over and over again that we should
only be prisoners for one night, but when we got to the shed yesterday
evening you stopped in the middle of a sentence and seemed to remember
something, and since then you have made no more prophecies.”

“It wasn’t that I remembered something, but that I realised
something,” said Wylie, shifting the rugs he was carrying from his arm
to his shoulder, and speaking under their shelter. “When I expected to
be rescued to-day, I thought we should still be inside the triangle
formed by the road, the railway, and the river, in which we were
captured. When we did not arrive last night, the people across the
river would inquire by telegraph whether we had started, and it would
be seen at once that something had happened to us on the road. There
are enough soldiers and gendarmes within easy reach to sweep the
triangle thoroughly from the road and railway to the river, and we
were bound to be discovered.”

“And it was after we crossed the river that you saw we were no longer
inside the triangle? But I thought the country to the south was much
more settled. Would the brigands really take us there?”

“Ah, that’s their artfulness. Did you truly think it was the river we
crossed last night--only twenty feet wide, and shallow enough to wade
through?”

“But what else could it have been--just a stream? Then we should still
be inside the triangle.”

“It was not water at all; it was the railway.”

“Oh!” said Zoe blankly. “How could you tell?” she added.

“Didn’t you notice that there was no sound of water? One would have
expected a good deal of noise from the way in which the brigands
pretended to stumble about, as if the current was a swift and broken
one. That struck me at one, and I listened hard. If the men carrying
me had been wearing boots, I should have heard them crunching on the
ballast, or knocking against the rails, but of course their moccasins
made no noise. But I noticed that they lifted their feet to avoid
something four times, and by calculating the length of their steps I
found it was just where the rails would naturally come. Then I was
sure.”

“Then it’s no good our hoping to be rescued soon?”

“We won’t give up hope, certainly. But it’s a stern-chase now--no
chance of our being surrounded. And this is the brigands’ own country,
where the Grand Seignior’s writ can hardly be said to run.”

“Then it may be days--or weeks--or months?” breathed Zoe faintly. “How
can we stand it?”

“Only a day at a time, at any rate, and any day may be the last. Think
you are on the North-West Frontier, as that appeals to you so much.
I’ll fight my battles, or rather scrambles, o’er again for your
benefit. Do you mind telling me why it should be more comforting to be
climbing, under equally unpleasant conditions, in the Suleiman Koh
than in the Balkans?”

“I don’t know; it’s just the feeling,” said Zoe. “Oh!” stepping on a
rolling stone and clutching at him wildly. “Oh, what shall we do? Look
at that place in front!”

“It’s a bad bit,” said Wylie judicially. “I shall want both my hands
free.” He was twisting the rugs rapidly into a long roll, which he
passed over one of his shoulders and under the other arm. “Now if you
could lend me the hat-pin I honourably restored to you this morning, I
shall have nothing to think of but getting you across. Your brother
has done some climbing, hasn’t he? Otherwise I had better take you
over first, and come back for your sister.”

Zoe’s lips moved, but no sound came from them as she returned him the
hat-pin, a good deal bent by its use as a peg, and he fastened the
ends of the rugs across his chest. “Now, don’t be frightened,” he said
cheerfully. “We’ll get you across all right. You may be quite sure you
are much too valuable to the brigands for them to let you get killed
here. Here’s your own particular pet ruffian coming to our help. What
a blessing it isn’t Milosch! He would stop in the middle of the most
awful places to gas about his self-sacrifice in lending his aid. And
Zeko has a rope, too. This is first-class.”

Zeko, the brigand whose head Zoe had bound up, made signs as he came
that Wylie and he would fasten the ends of the rope round their own
waists, and take Zoe between them; and thus they started on their
perilous journey. For a hundred yards or so the path was non-existent,
the bare rock running sheer down with only a very slight slope.
Happily, the stone was soft enough to allow the cutting of holes for
feet and hands, but the brigands had not considered the comfort of
ladies in preparing these. It was almost impossible for Zoe to support
both feet or both hands at the same time, and she spent some of the
most frightful moments in her life in standing with one foot wedged
into a crevice while Zeko, hanging in some miraculous way below her in
front, guided the other to the next foothold, and Wylie, gripping the
rock firmly with one hand, held out the other that she might cling to
it as she swung herself on. The brigands in front were sitting down to
watch and criticise the performance, and those behind were quarrelling
who should pilot Maurice and Eirene, for Zeko had refused
contemptuously to trouble himself about them. A man was impressed into
the service at last, and Zoe, now safely on the path again, but sick
and faint after her terrible experience, hid her eyes that she might
not see the transit. It seemed impossible that Maurice could
accomplish it successfully, for, in addition to the difficulties Wylie
had surmounted, he had the brigand rearguard pressing on his heels,
cursing him for not quitting each foothold quicker, and even striking
his hands with their sticks to make him loose his hold of the rock. He
paid no attention to them, and would not allow Eirene to hurry, as she
was inclined to try to do, finally bringing her safely across.

“I couldn’t have done it,” whispered Wylie to Zoe, and she welcomed
the tribute to Maurice gratefully.

This was the worst experience in the day’s journey, but the track
still wound round projecting rocks, above precipices, and up
torrent-beds. The girls were utterly exhausted before the end was
reached, and Maurice and Wylie could only drag them ruthlessly on,
scolding, encouraging, even threatening, though not with the
cold-blooded realism of the brigands, whose untranslated menaces
betrayed an ingenuity springing from long practice in torture. At last
a thick patch of wood in a sheltered cleft on the mountain-side was
pointed out as the halting-place for the night, and two of the
brigands, who had gone on in advance some time before, rejoined the
rest with a couple of goats, which they mentioned casually that they
had requisitioned from a goatherd who was so unfortunate as to pasture
his flock in the neighbourhood. Instantly the wood became a scene of
pleasant bustle. Some of the band cleared a space for a camp, others
began to prepare huge fires where the trees would prevent the lights
being seen from the valley below, and the rest devoted themselves to
culinary operations of a brief and sketchy character.

The prisoners were left to themselves, in the comfortable security
that they could not possibly run away, however much they might wish
it. The girls sat obediently where they had been placed, leaning
against a tree, and went to sleep forthwith, while Maurice and Wylie,
with a knife borrowed from Zeko, cut down branches and bushes and
built a hut for them--an attention which it had not occurred to the
brigands to offer. The hut was just large enough to hold the two
comfortably. Its floor was of pine-boughs covered with a rug, and it
had a kind of screen of twisted branches for a door. In front of it
the captives were allowed to kindle a small fire of their own, and at
this Wylie began to cook their supper. Milosch, with much ostentation,
had brought them a piece of goat’s-flesh as a proof of Stoyan’s
solicitude for their welfare, and Wylie cut this up into kabobs, which
he toasted on improvised wooden skewers. The smell was so savoury that
it penetrated the girls’ slumbers and woke them, and they sat up and
displayed an intelligent interest in Wylie’s proceedings as they
waited till the meat was ready. Never had they tasted anything so
delicious in their lives, they declared, as the scorched morsels of
meat, eaten as fast as they were ready, without plates or knives and
forks, from the skewers on which they were cooked. Zoe even began to
moralise on the readiness of civilised humanity to revert to savagery,
which was a proof, as Maurice said, that she was getting over her
fatigue already. After the meal the girls refused to go to bed at
once, declaring that they wanted to enjoy the sensation of resting
instead of losing it in sleep, and the faithful Zeko brought them an
offering of four cigarettes to round off the entertainment. Zoe felt
obliged to light hers and pretend to smoke it, though she dropped it
into the fire as soon as Zeko’s back was turned, but Eirene smoked as
calmly and with as much enjoyment as the men. The cigarettes, though
treated with the utmost tenderness, were soon finished, and Maurice
and Wylie stretched themselves luxuriously upon the carpet of
pine-needles which covered the ground, to enjoy a well-earned rest
after their labours.

“If I may offer a piece of practical advice,” said Wylie to the girls,
“it is that you should take off your boots, and rest your feet as much
as possible.”

“It’s quite clear that you have been here before, so to speak,” said
Zoe, as she prepared to comply. “When the commanding officer advises
just what one was longing to do, it’s delightful to obey.”

“Oh, don’t!” cried Eirene, with an ostentatious groan, as she pulled
off a sadly disfigured little shoe. “I have heard you talking in that
way for hours--pretending, always pretending. ‘These are the Shinwari
Hills, all brown and burnt and bare. Below in the valley is the tower
of a Waziri chief. There is an Afridi force waiting for us round the
next corner. We are carrying rifles and rations and water-bottles and
all sorts of utterly useless things----’”

“I appeal to you,” protested Wylie to Zoe; “did I really talk such
piffle as all that? If I did, our misfortunes must have turned my
brain.”

“Oh, you didn’t say exactly those things,” said Eirene--“though I
heard the names so often that I know they are right--but it was always
that sort of thing, pretending that there was eternal snow on one side
and a precipice a mile deep on the other, instead of disagreeable
rough hills, covered with ugly trees, which are always either tripping
you up with their roots, or knocking off your hat with their branches.
In a day or two I shall have to wear a handkerchief on my head like a
peasant woman,” and she contemplated ruefully the remains of her hat,
which had started in life as a smart straw, with a peculiarly
deceptive and Parisian air of simplicity about it. “And instead of
noble, chivalrous Orientals”--a protest from Wylie--“with snow-white
robes and splendid turbans, we have these detestable rogues who call
themselves Christians, with kilts black with dirt, and no more feeling
than a stone. What is the use of pretending about it?”

“It seems to have called up heroic and romantic visions in your mind,
at any rate,” said Zoe, “and that ought to have lightened the tedium
of the march.”

“And, anyhow, I didn’t inflict it on you,” said Maurice.

“Indeed you did not. You were too cross or too miserable--I don’t know
which--to talk, so that I heard the others the whole time.”

“Awfully sorry to have bored you,” said Wylie. “You see, I thought it
might help your sister along if I drew on my recollections of old
days.”

“It did,” cried Zoe. “I don’t believe I could have kept up without it.
Why did you listen, if you were bored, Eirene?”

“It wasn’t that exactly,” explained Eirene; “but it seemed so silly.
We are not children; what good can it do to pretend?”

“If it helps us to bear things more cheerfully, surely that’s some
good?” suggested Zoe.

“But what is the use of pretending to be cheerful? All the first part
of the day, before I was too tired myself to care to listen, I used to
hear Captain Wylie say to you, ‘Awf’ly fagged?’ and you conjured up a
sprightly voice, and said, ‘Oh dear, no--hardly at all.’ It wasn’t
true, and he knew it. What good did it do to pretend?”

“It was true,” said Zoe stoutly. “The mere fact of being asked the
question made one feel less tired for the moment. And you do say the
horridest things, Eirene.”

“She is like the old woman whose clergyman remonstrated with her for
bearing her troubles so badly,” said Maurice. “The old lady told him
that when chastening was sent us, it meant that we should be
chastened, and she wasn’t going to pretend not to be.”

“Well,” said Wylie, rather tartly, “it has grown to be a sort of
tradition, I suppose, among English people that each should keep up
for the sake of the rest, and all I can say is that I hope it’ll go
on. I don’t see the use of asking questions and speculating about it.”

“I am inquiring into national character,” said Eirene, undaunted. “The
people I know, when they are asked if they are in trouble, acknowledge
it at once, and point out what a dreadful trouble it is, and how no
one was ever quite so sorely tried before----”

“And turn it round and inside out, and hold it up to catch the light,”
put in Zoe.

“But if you ask an Englishman, he looks down at you as if he was a
mile high, and says with an icy smile, ‘Not at all. Rather enjoy it
than otherwise!’” with a very fair imitation of Wylie’s displeased
manner.

“How awfully smart you are this evening, Eirene!” drawled Maurice.
“Hairbreadth escapes seem to sharpen your wits. But I think it’s about
time all good little girls were in bed.”

“I could talk all night when I am interested,” persisted Eirene.

“I haven’t the very faintest, slightest shadow of doubt of it. But Zoe
is half-asleep, and Wylie is nodding, and my eyes would shut of
themselves if they were not fixed on your speaking countenance. Hullo,
what’s up?”

There was a commotion among the brigands feasting round the other
fire, caused by the sudden arrival of a man, who was gesticulating
violently towards the direction from which they had come. By the
firelight the prisoners recognised him as their treacherous driver of
the day before.

“Is it help? Are we going to be rescued?” cried Zoe eagerly.

“No such luck; I wish it were,” said Wylie, who had caught some of the
newcomer’s words. “Never mind about me,” he went on, rising, “just go
to bed. I want to hear what this chap has to say.”

He went towards the other fire, and to the horror of the three left
behind, the brigands sprang at him like one man, with howls of fury.
Curses and execrations were poured on him, he was hustled and dragged
hither and thither, and angry men threatened him with pistols and
drawn daggers.

“What can it be?” murmured Zoe, with white lips.

“I don’t know. Keep quiet,” said Maurice, buttoning his coat and
squaring his fists. For the girls’ sake he would keep out of it as
long as he could, but if Wylie was struck he must go in and back him
up, little as two unarmed men could hope to do against a crowd with
knives. To his relief, order was presently restored by the
intervention of the chief, after which Milosch made a long and
evidently moving oration, and Wylie returned to his friends, scowls
and murmurs of hatred following him.

“Oh, what was it?” cried Zoe as he reached them.

“Nothing; merely the penalty for playing the fool,” he replied. “You
know how long they kept us standing about with our hands tied before
we started this morning? I was standing rather by myself, and the
ground was sandy, so the bright idea seized me of leaving our rescuers
a clue to the way we were going. With my boot I drew ‘N.W.’ fairly
deep in the sand, shuffling about as if I was tired of standing so
long. Unfortunately, the gentleman who has just arrived reached the
place before the rescuers, and twigged what the letters meant. This
diffusion of Western learning in the East is a nuisance. Hence all the
fuss. Milosch was particularly severe on my ingratitude in trying to
betray the brigands after all they had done for us, and I had to
remind them of the way in which we were tied at that very moment. So
they calmed down, as you see.”

“I should have done it if I had thought about it,” confessed Maurice.
“And yet--these chaps can make things so beastly uncomfortable for the
girls, you know.”

“Oh, Maurice, don’t be so ungrateful!” cried Zoe. “If it had
succeeded, we should all be saying what a splendid idea it was, and
how clever Captain Wylie was to think of it. And, at any rate, it’s
over now.”

“Is it over?” asked Eirene. Wylie hesitated.

“Well,” he said, “I believe they are taking the night to think about
it. But, after all, what can they do? It wouldn’t be to their interest
to treat any of us badly, you know. They might refuse to accept my
parole and tie my hands again, but they haven’t, so far. So let us be
cheerful.”




 CHAPTER IX.
 ONE TOO MANY.

“Oh, I say! It can’t be time to get up yet,” groaned Maurice,
rolling over resentfully on his couch of pine-needles as a hand was
laid on his shoulder. But the hand shook him slightly, and Wylie’s
voice said, “Wake up, and don’t make a row.”

Throwing off the rug, Maurice sat up, blinking in the grey light of
dawn. He and Wylie had chosen their sleeping-places in front of the
hut, so that the girls might know they were at hand in case of an
alarm in the night; but Wylie was now beckoning him away from it. On
the other side of the ashes where the fire had been stood the brigands
in a row, grim and silent, with their rifles ready. Maurice stared.

“What’s up?” he asked in bewilderment.

“We desire not so moch to guard,” responded Milosch. “You too many for
us. Ze women are precious, and zere most be one man for to attend upon
zem. Ze ozer most go. We make you draw ze lot.”

“All right, all right! but you needn’t do it where the ladies can hear
you,” said Wylie impatiently. “Come along, Smith.” Wide awake by this
time, Maurice rose, and they followed the brigands into the wood,
Wylie grasping Maurice’s arm to draw him out of earshot of Milosch.
“Look here,” he said. “If the lot falls upon you, of course I’ll take
it, for your sisters can’t do without you, but I’m pretty certain it’s
only a trick to get rid of me. They’ve been planning this all night.”

“But you don’t think they’d dare--to _kill_ you?”

“Why not? They killed Haji Ahmad without compunction. Their lives are
forfeit already, you see, and so long as your sisters are alive, they
know that no Government will dare to hunt them down.”

“Zese woods of different shortness,” said Milosch, advancing with a
couple of twigs. “You select each, and we tell you which has drawn ze
black ball.”

“But which represents the black ball--the long one or the short one?”
demanded Maurice.

“Zat not for you to know. We tell you when ze lot is drawn.”

“I told you so,” murmured Wylie. “Whichever I draw is the fatal one.
Here, Milosch, let me choose.”

He took one of the twigs, the shorter, and Maurice found himself with
the other in his hand. Stoyan, coming forward, measured their length
with great deliberation, and announced that the lot had fallen upon
Wylie. Maurice sprang forward furiously, but Wylie pinned his arms to
his sides.

“Now don’t let us give ourselves away,” the doomed man entreated. “I
know what you feel like, and what you would like to do, but your
business just now is to think of your sisters. They must not be left
in the hands of these scoundrels without a protector. You’ll have to
look after them both now. Don’t let them know what’s happened to me if
you can help it. Can’t you let them think I have been taken away to be
kept safe somewhere? Remember, they have a lot to bear already.”

“I can’t stand by and see you murdered,” panted Maurice.

“I don’t want you to. Go back to the hut. Your sisters will be
terrified if they wake and find us both gone. Good-bye, and good luck
to you. I wouldn’t ask for a better comrade at a pinch than you have
been all through this.”

“Any messages?” asked Maurice shortly.

“No, I have no one to trouble about me, and my affairs are all in
order. Some day you might tell your eldest sister that I was sorry to
leave without saying good-bye to her.”

“Ze Voivoda say he exhausted of waiting,” said Milosch, coming up with
a handkerchief, which he proceeded to tie over Wylie’s eyes.

“Now go, go!” entreated Wylie of Maurice. “You must think of the
girls, as I ought to have done yesterday instead of playing the fool.”

Maurice wrung his hand and withdrew, slowly and reluctantly. At the
edge of the wood he turned, hearing his friend’s voice raised angrily.
“For heaven’s sake, leave me my hands free!” Wylie cried, but Maurice
gathered that the demand was refused. He went on into the clearing,
and sat down beside the extinguished fire, a prey to the deepest
despondency he had ever known. Without Wylie, how were he and the
hapless girls to face the trials before them? He himself might be the
next sacrifice to the savagery of the brigands, and what would then
become of Zoe and Eirene, since neither fear nor avarice seemed potent
to restrain their captors? Wylie’s resourcefulness, his restless
energy, his cheerfulness, and the underlying force of character which
manifested itself only occasionally, but was therefore all the more
telling, had made him a tower of strength, and Maurice felt bitterly
his own comparative futility. His life had taught him to exercise a
certain amount of initiative, clogged by the habit, inculcated as a
duty, of weighing the merits of a question before deciding on it, but
while he was thinking, Wylie would act--would have acted, rather. The
thought swept over Maurice with desolating effect. The man of action
was taken, the man who could only feel sure of himself in the humdrum
routine of daily life was left. It did not occur to him that Wylie had
not grown to his full mental height in a day, or that he himself might
draw from the depths of his present desolation the experience which
would complete the measure of his manhood.

“Maurice, how slack you look!” cried Zoe, putting out a dishevelled
head gingerly at the door of the hut. “Mind you tell Captain Wylie
that he must give us some more kabobs for breakfast.”

“All right. They’ll be ready. Provided,” with a sudden happy
inspiration, “that you promise faithfully to eat them before you begin
to talk. It’s no good my--our cooking if you let the things get cold
when they ought to be eaten at once.”

“I promise, honour bright!” said Zoe, and Maurice began to collect
wood for a fresh fire, half fearing that orders for the march would be
issued before he had time to do any cooking. But the brigands came
back into camp and sat down round their own fire with the evident
intention of taking their ease, and when the girls came out of the hut
they found Maurice busy toasting his face as well as a bountiful
supply of kabobs.

“Where’s Captain Wylie?” they cried.

“What did you promise?” asked Maurice repressively. “Sit down and
begin at once, and I’ll be doing some more.”

“Maurice, you are eating none yourself,” cried Zoe, having kept her
promise until hunger was satisfied. “And where is Captain Wylie? He
didn’t get his face nearly as much burnt as you do.”

“Oh, I don’t know. Somewhere about, I suppose,” mumbled Maurice. “Have
some more?”

“No, thanks; I don’t want any more. Maurice, has anything happened to
him? Do you really know where he is?”

“Can’t you let the poor chap alone?” demanded Maurice desperately. “He
hasn’t escaped by himself and left us in the lurch--I can tell you
that, at any rate.”

“No, but has he been taken away? I believe something has happened.
Tell me honestly, Maurice; where is he?”

“They took him away early this morning,” admitted Maurice. “He thought
himself it was out of spite for his trying to get us rescued. He asked
me to say how sorry he was not to bid you good-bye.”

“Good-bye? Then he thought---- They weren’t going to kill him?”

“How can I tell? They didn’t do it when I was there.”

“But you think they have done it? And you let them?”

“Look here,” said Maurice; “I’d better tell you all I know, and you
can see what you think.” He told his story as fast as he could, with
involuntary pauses here and there.

“Then there can be no doubt,” said Zoe slowly at last. “He is dead
now.”

“I admire you both,” said Eirene, with her gracious air of
distributing praise impartially. “Your duty was to the living, and he
knew it. He could only die, and he did that well. Some day----”

“Eirene,” said Zoe, with concentrated bitterness, “if you say you will
raise a memorial church in his honour, I shall hate you till I die.”

She rose and went into the hut, and Eirene turned to Maurice.

“You think he is dead?” she said.

“Why, of course. What else could I think?”

“I don’t believe it in the least. I think they were trying to frighten
him--as a punishment for yesterday, you know. I think they will
blindfold him and tie his hands and pretend to take him to the edge of
a rock and throw him over, but he will only fall one or two feet.”

“Good gracious, Eirene! how can you think of such diabolical things?”
cried Maurice.

“But it is not as if it would hurt him really. They would wish to see
him show fear; that would be most natural. It would be foolish for
them to kill him. If they found themselves hotly pressed--do you
say?--they might kill one of us as a warning to the pursuers, but to
do it without any purpose would only diminish their power of
bargaining for a ransom and an amnesty.”

“Well, if you’re so certain, why don’t you tell Zoe?”

Eirene shrugged her shoulders. “She is determined that he is dead; how
could my sole opinion change her mind? If I thought it would comfort
her I would tell her; but suppose that we see him no more again until
we are all ransomed and set free? She would determine again that he
was dead, and suffer twice over.”

“I only hope you may be right, and that he is alive,” said Maurice
gloomily.

The brigands had finished their meal, and were peacefully employed in
mending their clothes and moccasins, while the chief was seated under
a tree, in close confabulation with Milosch. A sentry was stationed at
the head of the track leading to the clearing, there was another on
the brow of the mountain above, and a third, as Maurice knew, at the
lower end of the wood. Everything seemed to portend a quiet day,
without further wandering, and Maurice felt the fact an added trial,
welcome though the prospect of rest was. If Wylie was not already
dead, where was he, and what fate was intended for him? It was
maddening to think of repeating these questions for a whole day,
uninterrupted by any possibility of useful occupation.

As Maurice sat engrossed in his dreary meditations, Zoe came out of
the hut, red-eyed and gruff-voiced, but overflowing with nervous
energy.

“Do let us find something to do, Maurice, if we are to stay here all
day,” she said. “Let us make a hut for you. I’m sure it will be better
for you than sleeping in the open another night.”

Maurice rose at once, receiving a wholly unnecessary glance of advice
from Eirene, which said, “Humour her; she needs something to divert
her mind,” and going into the wood, began to choose fresh branches,
and cut them down with the useful knife which served so many purposes.
Zoe threw herself into the work with determination, and Eirene sat
enthroned on a hillock at the foot of a tree and gave counsel.

“Make it large enough for Captain Wylie as well,” she said, as
Maurice, thinking he had cut enough twigs, was gathering them into a
bundle to carry back to the clearing; “he may be back to-night.”

“Eirene, how can you?” cried Zoe indignantly, and stopped, unable to
say more.

“Look here, Eirene,” said Maurice, exasperated, “can’t you get
something to do? It’s all very well to sit there looking on----”

“Oh, she can’t,” broke in Zoe. “Her arm got strained again in crossing
that awful place yesterday, and it was rather bad when I dressed it
this morning. Let her alone; I suppose she has her own idea of a
joke.”

Eirene’s glance at Maurice said, “What did I tell you?” as she rose
and picked her way daintily back to the clearing. When they returned
thither with their burdens, she retired to a rock at some little
distance, with an ostentatious air of leaving them to their obstinate
ill-humour in peace. Finding that they took no notice of her, however,
she came gradually nearer, in order to give them the benefit of her
valuable advice, which proved more useful than might have been
expected, since, as she said, she had often watched her father’s
foresters build huts of birch-boughs in her childhood. When she
repeated her suggestion that the hut should be made large enough for
two, however, Maurice felt obliged to intervene with a pacific
compromise.

“We have all day to spend over it,” he said, “so we can make a better
job of it than the one we ran up in a hurry last night. You girls
shall move into it, do you see? and I’ll succeed to the old one.”

Zoe accepted the suggestion in silence, and they went on with their
work, interweaving the slanting branches which formed the sides with
smaller boughs and twigs. They worked hard most of the day, and talked
so little that Eirene found them very dull company. At last she left
them in despair, and wandered up the hill towards the rock where the
sentry stood, taking care to keep within sight of the clearing. They
saw her seat herself on a convenient stone and begin to study the
landscape, and then they forgot all about her until an exclamation
from her, simultaneously with a shout from the sentry, made them start
to their feet and the brigands grasp their rifles.

“Can we have been traced after all?” cried Maurice.

“A day too late!” murmured Zoe. “Oh, if they had only come up with us
last night!”

“Well, all our work won’t be much good, for they’ll be sure to hurry
us away somewhere else,” said Maurice, noticing that the brigands were
hastily cramming their possessions into their sacks. But presently
another shout from the sentry, following on a faint hail from the
distance, announced that only three men were in sight, and they were
friends. Almost at the same moment, Eirene came rushing frantically
down the hillside.

“It is himself! I told you so!” she cried. “It is Captain Wylie and
two of the brigands. I was sure of it. They were only trying to
frighten him, and he is coming back.”

“Oh, let us go and meet him!” cried Zoe.

“Let Maurice go,” said Eirene primly. “Your eyes are so red, Zoe,” she
added in a low voice.

“Don’t be Early-Victorian, Eirene,” was the crushing reply. “Do you
think I mind his seeing that I cried because I thought he was killed?
I should be ashamed if I hadn’t!”

They went down the track in the wake of the brigands, who were
jostling one another in mingled surprise, irritation, and alarm. The
two members of the band who accompanied Wylie began to pour forth
explanations and excuses at the top of their voices long before any
words could be clearly distinguished, and while they were seized and
cross-examined by their fellows, Wylie was able to reach his friends.

“You haven’t quite done with me yet!” he said, giving one hand to Zoe
and the other to Maurice, while Eirene waited for a more ceremonious
greeting. “I shall be able to cook one more supper for you before I am
sent off.”

“Then it was all a trick?” asked Maurice.

“Well, in a way. You would have been left to think that I was dead, as
a warning to you against playing the fool, I suppose, but what I was
really picked out for was a very serious matter--getting your ransom.
The brutes over-reached themselves utterly in the way they went to
work, and the result is that here I am.”

“What a lot you must have to tell us!” said Zoe. “Wait till we get to
the camp, so that we can listen comfortably.”

“Why, you must have spent the day in house-building!” said Wylie, as
they reached the clearing.

“That’s exactly what we did--to drown our misery,” said Maurice. “Now
begin. Did they pretend to shoot you, or any vile trick like that?”

“No, only cuffed and hustled me down these goat-tracks for ever so
far, which was no joke with my eyes covered and my hands tied. I
really do wonder that I’m here to tell the tale, for I did more
slipping than walking. At last we seemed to come to a comparatively
level place, and they took the handkerchief off my eyes and set me
free, and instructed me to make the best of my way back to
civilisation and tell your friends to send fifteen thousand pounds by
this day month if they wanted to see you again alive.”

“Fifteen thousand pounds!” gasped Zoe.

“Yes, it sounds a large order, but that wasn’t what stumped me. It was
that I really know nothing about you, except that I gather you have a
place in Homeshire. I know that Smith was at Cambridge and won a prize
for poetry, but I could hardly go there and open a subscription list,
or ask the Dons to mortgage the college revenues for his ransom, could
I? It sounds absurd that after all we have gone through together we
should know so little about each other, and I couldn’t make my guards
believe it. They evidently thought that we lived next door to one
another at home, or something of that sort, and laboured to explain to
me that if there had been only three of us they would have made us
write a letter, but as there were four, they sent one of us instead.
But at last I managed to make them understand that nothing could
induce me to show my face in Therma without proper credentials, and
that unless I knew who to apply to, there would be no chance of their
getting the money, so they decided to send back here for instructions.
But when it came to the point, neither of them would be left alone
with me, and as I declined to remain where I was and wait for them,
the only thing to do was to bring me back.”

“You said you were no longer blindfolded?” said Eirene, for Maurice
and Zoe were looking at one another in consternation. “Ah, yes, that
is it. The guards were afraid of you--of your eyes. They hate them.”

“Horribly bad taste in them,” said Wylie lightly. “Why, here’s our
friend Milosch coming--bringing us something for supper, I see.”

A sheep had been procured during the day--by nefarious means, of
course--and Milosch brought a portion of its flesh for the captives;
but he carried also Zoe’s safety inkstand, a leaf torn out of one of
her note-books, and a pen of unknown origin.

“You write now, before ze sun falls,” he said to Maurice, “a letter
signified by all of you. Ze ransom we demand is fifteen sousand
Ingliss pounds, to be placed in gold zis day month on a spot zat will
be indicated to your messager. If ze ransom comes not forth, or if
deception is adventured, we shall kill you, beginning wiz”--he looked
round with a calculating eye upon the three, who all afterwards
confessed to feeling cold shivers down their backs, and then
laughed--“No, I say not who we begin wiz. Perhaps we let you draw ze
lot again. From zis time you hold no communion wiz your messager but
in my presence; zerefore seek not to cook up fraud among yourselves.”

Maurice looked at Zoe in despair. How could they let Wylie proceed on
his quest in absolute ignorance of their real name? and yet, how could
they reveal it in the hearing of Milosch, who possessed the
disconcerting faculty of being able to understand English much better
than he spoke it? Zoe came to her brother’s help.

“Captain Wylie had better go to Professor Panagiotis,” she said.

“Professor Panagiotis!” said Eirene sharply. “What do you know about
him?”

“He is the friend we were going to stay with,” answered Zoe, in
surprise. “Do you know him?”

“He was an acquaintance of my father,” said Eirene, with some
hesitation. “I don’t remember that I have ever seen him.”

“Well, if he wouldn’t remember you we needn’t mention you separately,”
said Zoe quickly, wondering if Wylie was trying once more, as she
herself would have done, to reconcile the relationships of this
remarkable family. “If you will just say that we are all here
together?” she added to Wylie.

“Yes, I think the letter had better go to the Professor,” agreed
Maurice, “and then he can post you up, Wylie. There are some things
that can’t very well be explained here, but that have a tremendous
bearing on the case.”

The letter was written, duly signed by Maurice Smith, Zoe Smith, and
Eirene Smith, and addressed to the Professor at his villa at
Kallimeri. Milosch was highly entertained by the idea that the head of
the Greek party in Emathia should find himself compelled to finance
his Slavic opponents to so large an extent, and shouted the news to
the rest of the brigands as a huge joke. They chuckled over it without
him, for he did not quit the prisoners again. It was evidently his
business to see that no one exchanged a word with Wylie that might
cover any suggestion designed to cheat the band of their destined
spoil, or lead to their being hunted down, and even when Maurice and
Wylie rolled themselves up in their rugs to sleep, he sat between
them, revolver in hand.




 CHAPTER X.
 THE OTHER SIDE.

“Good-bye. I’m awfully sorry to leave you like this,” said Wylie to
Zoe, as he shook hands with her before his departure, while Milosch,
for the twentieth time, read over the letter to make sure there was no
deception about it.

“But how much better than the way you left us yesterday!” she said,
smiling.

“Oh, I didn’t mean that. I meant that I feel I am deserting you
personally. You and I have always been comrades, haven’t we? And I
don’t quite see how Smith is to squire two ladies at once along these
paths.”

“Perhaps we shan’t be moved on,” suggested Zoe. “I should think this
place is as safe and secluded as any they could find.”

“I only hope it may be so. Do you know”--he lowered his voice--“I
almost think I could find my way up here from the place to which they
took me yesterday? They forgot to cover my eyes again, you know. If
they take me down the same way to-day, I shall be quite sure of it.”

“But what good would that be?”

“Why, you don’t imagine I shall be content to leave you in these
fellows’ hands a whole month? I shall kick up the biggest row that
ever was, and simply force the Government to take action. I have a
little account of my own to work off with the brigands, you must
remember, and I don’t feel like putting fifteen thousand pounds into
their pockets.”

“But if we are not ransomed they will kill us.”

“Not if you are rescued first,” said Wylie promptly. “Don’t be afraid.
You don’t think I would let a hair of your head be hurt, do you? But
if I can save you three weeks or a fortnight of this sort of thing,
and at the same time do the brigands out of their prospective gains,
do you honestly expect me to lose the chance?”

He waved his hand to her gaily as he went down the hill-track with his
custodians, and Zoe fell into a reverie, from which she roused herself
with a vigorous mental shake.

“It’s a good thing he’s gone,” she said to herself. “We have been
comrades, as he said, and it has been very nice. In a few days more I
shouldn’t have been able to do without him, and that is out of the
question. I have the world to see and my name to make before I think
of anything of that sort. Yes, it is a good thing.”

But this decision was no sort of justification for Eirene’s taking it
upon herself to remark that she was glad Captain Wylie was gone,
because he ordered Maurice about. A coolness ensued between the two
girls, which lasted until Eirene, who wanted to mend her torn shoe,
was obliged to apply to Zoe to obtain a needle and thread from Zeko.

Very early on the morning after Wylie’s departure the other prisoners
found that the brigands were not quite so simple as he had hoped. They
had no intention whatever of remaining at the spot where he had left
them until he might choose to return. The clearing and the huts were
forsaken before dawn, and another day of painful wandering and
climbing by devious tracks followed. Zeko, in a lordly and
contemptuous way, hauled Zoe over the worst places, so that Maurice
was free to look after Eirene, but both girls were utterly spent
before the crowning trial of the march occurred. This was a long stiff
climb up the bed of a torrent, which, in spite of the summer weather,
had quite enough water in it to make the girls miserably wet, and
destroy the last possibility of usefulness in their shoes. They were
practically bare-footed when they staggered into the little valley
from which the torrent flowed down the hillside, and discovered that
they were now so high up in the mountains that cold was to be added to
their other discomforts. Even the brigands were stirred to pity by
their white faces and chattering teeth, or perhaps they feared lest
hardship should release their prisoners before they could be ransomed,
for they helped Maurice to collect wood for a good fire, and made the
girls sit down close to it to dry their skirts. The chief went so far
as to administer a small quantity of a potent, if smoky spirit, which
took away their breath and made their eyes water, and he also
requisitioned a pair of moccasins for each of them from two members of
the band who were unwary or fastidious enough to carry more than was
needed for immediate wear. The trees up here were too sparse to allow
of building huts, but in the rocks by the side of the stream there
were hollows which might almost be called caves, and Maurice swept one
of these out with a branch, made a smaller fire in it, and arranged
the rugs for beds. He himself was accustomed now to sleeping outside,
wrapped in one of the brigands’ greatcoats, but although he was
allowed to lie near the fire, he never forgot the piercing cold of
that night, while inside the cave the girls lay close together with
both the rugs over them, and shivered in spite of all. Their
appearance alarmed the brigands in the morning, and greatcoats and
leggings, such as the men wore, were allotted to them in addition to
the moccasins. Their feet were so badly bruised that they could not
walk alone, but they were helped up to a sort of ledge on the sunny
side of the gorge, where they were at last able to feel warm again.
Needles and thread were lent them to alter the clothes into some
approach to fit, and on the return of three of the band from an
absence of some duration, the chief presented them with large coarse
handkerchiefs to replace their battered hats. Maurice, whose broken
head was now sufficiently recovered to dispense with bandages, was
invested with a fez, from which Stoyan solemnly removed the tassel
with his knife, on the ground that it was unbecoming for a captive to
wear a tassel to his fez.

Maurice had not been idle during the day. He had collected all the
loose pieces of rock he could find, and built them up into a rough
wall, cemented with mud from a spot where the stream formed a marshy
pool, to keep the wind from blowing into the cave. The brigands who
had brought the handkerchiefs had carried also a large truss of straw,
and this was spread thickly on the floor, so that the girls found
their second night’s quarters far more restful than the first. The
exhaustion which was the result of the forced march was also passing
away, and on the second day they were able to begin to practice
walking in the moccasins, which was an art needing some caution.

A week passed quietly, varied only by the expeditions of the brigands
to obtain food and news. They seemed to have a well-organised
intelligence system, by means of which they learned that there was
much activity among the Roumi authorities, civil and military, and
that soldiers were being sent into the mountains in various
directions. The brigands displayed amusement rather than apprehension
over this news, and there was no lack of food, which would have argued
that the peasants were losing their fear of their unacknowledged
masters. The girls spent a good deal of time in patching their
tattered garments with pieces of the rough brown stuff some of the
brigands wore, and also relieved Maurice of his domestic duties, thus
leaving him free to execute wonderful engineering works in connection
with the stream, damming it in one place to make a pool where the
girls might get water close to their cave, and arranging pieces of
rock as steps. The energy of the prisoners astonished their captors,
who seemed to think it the height of bliss to lie in the sun, smoking
and quarrelling, or playing various rudimentary games of chance, and
at first every movement was regarded with suspicion. But by degrees
Maurice established with them a feeling almost akin to good
fellowship, and would sit among them round the fire, listening to
their talk, which he was beginning to understand without the
intervention of Milosch. Eirene objected strongly to this habit of
his, and, as was her wont, spoke her mind freely on the subject.

“It is so undignified, so contemptible!” she declared angrily. “A man
of elevated soul would suffer anything rather than associate on
familiar terms with wretches from whom he had received such vile
treatment.”

“But it’s to please myself, not them,” said Maurice. “I want to find
out why all these strapping fellows have turned brigands--to inquire
into their grievances, in fact.”

“Grievances! What business have they with grievances?”

“I don’t know; but they have got some, unfortunately.”

“But what have their grievances to do with you?”

“Why, I am a sufferer by them, so are you. Therefore I naturally feel
an interest in getting to know what they are.”

“And what are they, Maurice?” asked Zoe. “I thought these men all came
from Thracia or Dardania.”

“No, they are nearly all Illyrians--the Christian kind, such as it is.
They are Emathians born, though they are under foreign direction;
there’s no doubt of that. And very few of them seem to have become
brigands for the fun of the thing. Most of them are pretty sick of the
life, but they have made their own villages too hot to hold them.”

“But that was their own fault,” objected Eirene.

“Partly, but it was other people’s fault too. They have failed to pay
their taxes in bad years, or have mortgaged their land and been sold
up. Some of them have taken to the hills after assaulting
tax-collectors, and some on account of blood-feuds. They boast that
they only rob the rich, whom they hate most heartily; but I fancy that
the poor haven’t much choice about keeping them supplied with food and
clothes, especially if they are Greek poor.”

“Why, Maurice, you are hearing the other side!” cried Zoe.

“What other side?” asked Eirene sharply.

“When we heard Professor Panagiotis talk, Maurice said he should like
to hear the other side, and now he is doing it,” replied Zoe promptly.
Maurice, absorbed in his subject, might have revealed secrets if she
had allowed him to answer.

“Yes, it’s just as I thought, there are two very distinct sides to the
case,” he said thoughtfully. “It’s something appalling the way these
fellows hate the Orthodox Church and everything connected with it. It
seems they have been dragooned into belonging to it for generations,
with no alternative but Mohammedanism. The priests don’t appear to
have been examples to their flocks by any means, but were tremendously
keen on their dues, though they could only gabble through services
which neither they nor the people understood. All education was in
Greek, and the people hadn’t even the Bible in their own language, so
that the only chance for a man to rise was to turn his back on his own
nationality altogether.”

“And it was right he should!” cried Eirene, with flashing eyes. “Would
you degrade the Holy Scriptures and the sacred liturgies by
translating them from the glorious Greek into the uncouth dialects of
these barbarians?”

“What a very curious thing!” exclaimed Zoe involuntarily.

“What do you mean?” demanded Eirene.

“Why, it’s no use pretending that we don’t know you’re a Scythian,
Eirene, for you’ve said lots of things that show it. And it’s very
funny to hear you talking just as Professor Panagiotis did, when
Scythia is doing all she can to stir up the barbarians, as you call
them, against the Greeks.”

“Because I have been brought up in Scythia, must I be insensible to
truth and rightness?” cried Eirene. “It surprises me, I confess, to
find an Englishman supporting the guileful designs of the Slavs in
opposition to the noble cause of heroic and persecuted Greece.”

“I’m not supporting Slavs or anybody,” said Maurice. “If you are
anxious to define my attitude, I am blaming both sides impartially.
They have got things into such a muddle that it looks as if the whole
structure of society in Emathia would have to be built up again from
the foundations. If the taxes were honestly assessed and collected,
and the middleman eliminated, it would do a good deal, of course,
especially if you could also get rid of the money-lender by a system
of agricultural banks. But you would want to establish a system of
village responsibility, as they have done in Burmah, before you could
begin to stamp out blood-feuds and religious faction-fights. I must
ask Wylie how they manage to get a police-force which is not
prejudiced on one side or the other. Side by side with that, you would
have to be opening up the country with roads and railways, and getting
the priests better educated, and books translated, and schools
established, and the army thrown open to Christians and popularised,
so that brigandage would no longer be----”

“The only career for a young man of spirit,” supplied Zoe, as he
paused.

“Well,” burst forth Eirene, who had been listening in speechless
indignation as Maurice elaborated his views on the regeneration of
Emathia, “I should like to know what business it is of yours?”

“But why should it affect you?” asked Maurice, warned by an anxious
glance from Zoe.

“It is just like you English,” continued Eirene, disregarding the
question. “You meddle all over the world with countries which do not
concern you, while your own usurped India is ground under the iron
heel of men like Captain Wylie, of whom the very brigands are afraid!”

“Why, you say that as if it was to Wylie’s discredit!” said Maurice.
“I should have thought it was a distinct feather in his cap. You don’t
seem to see that just because we are English, every country that
doesn’t come up to our own high standard does concern us.”

Eirene lifted her head, almost tossed it. “When,” she began, then
changed the form of her sentence--“If I am ever a ruler, I will allow
no English to dictate to me. I shall recognise no grievances. If the
people disobey me, I shall stamp them out.”

“Making a solitude and calling it peace, indeed!” said Zoe.

“Cheerful country yours will be to live in!” said Maurice. “Are you
going to have periodical killings-out, like King Twala? or shall you
set half the population to kill the other half, and make the survivors
fight among themselves till they are all killed, like the Kilkenny
cats? Or is it only the present generation that is to be wiped out, so
that you may have the children brought up in the way they should go? A
lively time you’ll have when the hereditary tendencies begin to come
out! Why, they’ll all have blood-feuds against you.”

“I used the wrong word,” said Eirene, with heightened colour. “I meant
to say that I would stamp the people down. I will listen to no one who
is in revolt; but when all rebellion has been suppressed, I shall see
for myself if there are any grievances.”

“You’ll allow people to complain of them peacefully, then?”

“Certainly not; that is rebellion. But I shall oversee everything
myself. Not a peasant shall be prosecuted for non-payment of taxes but
the case shall come before me for revision, and the same in all
departments of the state.”

“I don’t think your magistrates will hold office long,” said Maurice.

“Besides,” said Zoe, “that’s just the system that works so badly with
the Roumis, Eirene. The Grand Seignior will insist on managing
everything himself, and of course he can’t do more than a certain
amount, and so business gets into frightful arrears all over the
empire.”

“I don’t care,” said Eirene stubbornly. “I shall trust no one; that is
the lesson life has taught me. The ruler’s eye will be everywhere, the
ruler’s hand always ready.”

“Maternal or elder-sisterly government,” muttered Maurice. “Well,
Eirene, have it your own way, and go ahead, and Zoe and I will come
and preach revolution to your people. What would you do to us?”

“I would have you brought to the palace and treated as my dearest
friends and honoured guests,” responded Eirene, with a promptitude
which seemed to show that she had thought the matter out; “but you
would not leave it except to be conducted to the frontier.”

“And if we came back?”

“Then I should conclude that you wished to remain with me, and I
should assign you permanent quarters in the palace, where I could see
that you did no harm.”

“Well, we shall know what to do when we feel we can’t exist without
you any longer,” said Zoe lightly. A curious thought, almost a
certainty, had occurred to her, and she put a question which had to do
with it. “But won’t there be a king or prince to be considered in this
kingdom of yours? or do you expect your husband will let you do as you
like with his possessions?”

“There will be no husband,” said Eirene haughtily. “The possessions
will be mine, mine alone. And you are making attempts to discover who
I am.”

“We aren’t,” said Maurice indignantly, while the guilty Zoe maintained
a judicious silence. “How horribly suspicious you are, Eirene! Go and
whisper your secret to the reeds, if you like. We shan’t try to
listen.”

“I have been led into saying more than I intended,” said Eirene,
trying to extricate herself from an awkward situation with dignity. “I
see that, according to your views, I have no right to object to your
making imaginary schemes of reform for Emathia, and I do not object to
it, while you understand that they are imaginary. That makes the whole
difference.”

Maurice stared at her. “What a lofty benediction!” he said. “Eirene,
I’m afraid I shall offend again; but do you think your head is a
little bit affected by all you have gone through? If it is, only tell
us, and we shall know what to do. We will treat you as a queen in
exile with pleasure.”

“Now you are joking,” smiled Eirene. “No, my dear brother and sister,
continue to treat me as one of yourselves. Circumstances may divide us
in the future, but I shall never forget what you have been to me
during these weeks.”

“Good gracious!” murmured Maurice, and laying his head back on his
arms he whistled softly at the stars, while Zoe shook from head to
foot in an unconquerable spasm of silent laughter, and Eirene sat
gazing at the fire with a look of gentle melancholy.

The next evening Maurice returned smiling from his colloquy with the
brigands. “Well,” he said, “my undignified and contemptible pursuits
have given me quite an exciting piece of news for you. Wylie is
looking us up.”

“Oh, Maurice, what do you mean?” cried Zoe.

“Why, it seems that Demo and three others went down to-day to get
food. At the village, wherever it is, they were told that an English
traveller with one servant and a large quantity of luggage had stayed
the night there, and gone on into the mountains, refusing a guide. Our
fellows decided that such a chance was not to be lost, and having
found out which way the traveller had gone, went across country by
short cuts, and arranged a satisfactory ambush. They thought he must
either be mad, or riding through in bravado after hearing about us,
but the luggage would be all right, at any rate. I suppose he really
was a newspaper man. Well, they waited in cover, and presently the
traveller and his servant came along. The luggage looked so new and
wealthy that it made their mouths water, but happily for themselves
they didn’t act in a hurry. ‘They came near,’ said Demo, ‘and I
recognised the servant. It was the Capitan. He was wearing Nizam
dress, but I knew him by his accursed eyes; he couldn’t disguise them.
Then we saw that it was a trap, and we let them pass.’”

“But how was it a trap?” asked Eirene.

“Why, either Wylie and the other man were much better armed than they
looked, and meant to capture a brigand or two, so as to make them
reveal the hiding-places of the band, or they meant to be captured
themselves, and had spies to follow them up and see where they were
taken. I don’t see why Wylie wanted to disguise himself, though. He
might have known he would be recognised if he was caught, and then
they would be safe to kill him. As it was, he and the other man seem
to have ridden through the brigands’ country quite unmolested.”

“I wish he wouldn’t do such things!” said Zoe anxiously.

“Yes,” said Eirene, “he ought to remember that we depend upon him for
our ransom and rescue. He has no right to risk his life in foolish
bravado.”

“I think we may be pretty sure that Wylie had some ’cute idea in his
head,” said Maurice. “I don’t quite see what it is; but he certainly
risked being captured over again.”

“And this captivity is certainly not tempting,” said Zoe.

Wylie’s plan declared itself unexpectedly the very next day. The
prisoners had climbed up to what they called their afternoon ledge, a
shelf of rock which caught the westering sun, and were looking out
over the chaos of hills and valleys below them, and speculating for
the nine hundred and ninety-ninth time upon the prospects of their
release. Suddenly one of the brigands’ sentries, who was stationed
round a corner on their left, whence a view of the country to the
eastward could be obtained, ran in and shouted to his comrades. Wild
confusion instantly prevailed among the loungers in the hollow. Some
of them quenched the fires with earth, a heap of which was kept ready
for the purpose, and the rest caught up their weapons, and scaling the
ledge, flung themselves upon the prisoners, who expected nothing but
instant death. Not daring to move, they yielded helplessly to the
violence of the brigands, who dragged them as far back as possible, so
that they could only just see over the ledge, tore off the girls’
head-handkerchiefs, which showed white against the dark of the cliff,
and ordered them, if they valued their lives, to make no sound or
movement. Presently, the cause of the commotion came in sight far
below--a column of Roumi soldiers, led by an officer on horseback. In
front walked a man in plain clothes, examining the ground narrowly as
he went.

“Captain Wylie! He has tracked us!” murmured Zoe, under her breath.
Milosch turned upon her with a diabolical grin.

“Promise candles to ze saints zat he track you no furzer, zen. If he
find ze way up ze stream, you go down ze mountain to meet him--you
see?” He lifted Zoe’s chin, and with the point of his knife traced a
line upon her neck. She shrank away from him, sick and almost fainting
with horror, and he laughed. “We begin wiz you, after all,” he said.




 CHAPTER XI.
 TOO MUCH ZEAL.

“Take your dirty hands off her, you brute!” growled Maurice,
struggling ineffectually with the two men who were holding him down.
Milosch smiled again.

“You ze next,” he said. “We leave you at ze camp--dead, oh, yes! and
ze Roumi dogs will see how you died. Zere will be tree--four hours
while zey find ze way, but for you it will experience tree or four
days. And ze ozer girl,”--he cast a critical eye upon Eirene, who
shivered in spite of her utmost efforts to maintain a firm front,--“we
not kill her, no. We leave her also at ze camp, but living, to tell
what she see.”

The strain was too great, and, with a little gasp, Eirene fainted
away. Milosch chuckled. “Make not no mistakes,” he added impressively
to the furious Maurice. “It may be your friend achieve to discover
you--yes; but you will compensate in blood for ze ransom he hope to
defraud.”

Maurice turned away with as much impassivity as he could muster.
“Don’t you go and faint too, Zoe,” he said to his sister; “he’s only
trying to make our flesh creep. But don’t trouble about Eirene. I
don’t suppose it will hurt her to stay as she is for the present, and
it can’t be any pleasure to her to hear him talk.”

Zoe, who had been trying to get to Eirene, ceased her struggles, and
let her eyes return to the moving figures in the valley below. This
was evidently a critical moment, for the brigands were watching their
progress with strained attention. At last, when Wylie had passed a
particular point, a gasp of satisfaction showed that, in the opinion
of the band, the immediate danger was over.

“It’s the stream that has thrown him out,” muttered Maurice. “He’ll go
on ever so far looking for tracks before he guesses where we turned
off.”

“But how has he tracked us?” asked Zoe, who had now been released, and
was holding Eirene’s head on her knee, as the younger girl struggled
slowly back to consciousness.

“By the marks of our boots, of course,” said Maurice. “No one else in
the mountains wears boots, and there has been no rain since we came up
here. I say, I shall tell Wylie what I think of him when I see him
next. He has no business to sacrifice us to his grudge against the
brigands. That’s the worst of him, he’s an unforgiving brute, and the
trick they played on him the day they pretended they were going to
kill him rankles.”

“Maurice, you are absurd!” Zoe was engrossed in her ministrations to
Eirene, and could only talk in snatches. “He has some special reason
for this. I am sure of it. He may have a grudge against the brigands,
as you say, but he will wait to work it off until we are safe.”

“Then what’s he up to now?” demanded Maurice, and Zoe could offer no
explanation. Eirene laughed weakly.

“Zoe would say to him with her last breath, ‘I know you couldn’t help
it,’ and Maurice, ‘You brute! it’s all your fault,’” she said.

 “_Take your dirty hands off her, you brute!_” _growled Maurice._]

“And you?” asked Zoe, rather tartly.

“It is not to be my last breath, you know”--Eirene shivered again as
she rose shakily to her feet, with the help of Maurice’s hand--“but I
should say to him when we met, ‘You see, sir, the results of an excess
of zeal.’”

“Awfully scathing!” said Maurice, guiding her along the ledge. “I’m
coming back for you, Zoe; wait for me. No wonder you feel shaky, after
that sickening rascal’s talk.”

The camp seemed a haven of refuge after the experiences of the last
half-hour, and the girls sank down thankfully on their straw bed,
while Maurice seated himself on a stone at the door, and tried to make
conversation and distract their minds, not very successfully. Stoyan
succeeded where Maurice failed, however, for he made his appearance
suddenly, and saying something in his own language, threw down a pair
of leggings and moccasins before him, and held out his hand.

“He says I’m to put these on, and give him my boots,” explained
Maurice ruefully. “I’m afraid Wylie has let us in for it. He says, ‘No
sleep to-night, thanks to your friend.’”

“I suppose we had better pack up,” said Zoe, as the chief retired with
the boots.

“How I admire your common-sense, Zoe!” said Eirene, not offering to
move. “Why don’t you rest as long as you can, like me?”

“Because she knows you would look pretty blue if there were no coats
and things at the next halting-place,” said Maurice. “Come, get up.
You can luxuriate in the straw as long as they’ll let you, but we must
roll up the rugs.”

The rugs, wrapped round the scanty possessions of the party, were
Maurice’s burden, while the girls carried the coats, rolled up as
Wylie had shown them, so as to leave their arms free. But when they
were summoned to start, about an hour before sunset, the brigands made
them unfold the coats and put them on, drawing the hoods over their
heads, so that they could not be recognised from a distance. They felt
some surprise at starting in daylight, but the reason was soon
evident. They were to climb down the torrent-bed, up which they had
come to reach the valley, and not even the brigands cared to risk the
descent in the dark. Scouts had been sent to follow Wylie and the
Roumi force, and make sure that they were not returning, and these
brought word that the troops had taken up their quarters in a village
for the night, so that the move might safely be made. Going down the
torrent-bed was rather worse than going up, so far as slips and
tumbles and sudden sousings went, and the girls were bruised and
drenched when they reached the bottom. They were only allowed a moment
to wring their dripping skirts, and then the brigands set out briskly
in the dusk, taking the direction in which Wylie had gone. They knew
the rocky paths, and how to take advantage of the smoothest places,
but to the prisoners, unused to walking in moccasins, every step was a
lottery, which might prove painless, but was far more likely to be
agonising. Even when a rare stretch of comparatively soft ground
appeared, they were not allowed to take advantage of it, the brigands
casting about carefully until they found a way past it on the rocks,
lest any trail should remain to show that a number of people had
passed there after the soldiers. Darkness came on, and the prisoners
stumbled painfully along between their guards, who never stretched out
a hand to help them, but reviled them horribly when they slipped.
Regardless of dignity, the girls were reduced at last to clutching the
sleeves of the men on each side of them--more the brigands would not
permit, for fear of finding their arms encumbered in case of
danger--and even Eirene made no protest. After what seemed weary hours
of walking, the brigands suddenly stopped and closed round the
prisoners, two of the band stealing off into the darkness.

“We are going right through the village,” whispered Maurice. “Those
fellows are off to quiet the dogs.”

“And if you raise exclamation, we quiet you,” muttered Milosch,
unsheathing his long dagger.

It was some time before the two men returned, with the assurance that
all was well. The troops were comfortably quartered in the houses and
cattle-sheds, and they had located the watch-fires and the sentries,
and could guide the rest past them. Wylie and the Roumi officer were
at the house of the chief man of the place, and Stoyan breathed a
vehement and highly coloured aspiration that it had been prudent to
creep in and make an end of them. But as this was impossible if the
prisoners were to be placed in safe keeping, he repressed his
bloodthirsty inclinations, and the scouts led the party in and out
among huts and sheds, sometimes creeping on all-fours across a space
dimly illuminated by a watch-fire, sometimes pausing behind a wall
while a sentry passed. Every man among the brigands held his dagger
unsheathed, ready to strike if any of the prisoners made the slightest
attempt to raise an alarm, and the precaution was sufficient. Warmth,
shelter, safety, friends, were in the village, and with bursting
hearts the girls passed them by, and went on again into the dark cold
night. They were so tired by this time that their immediate guards
were forced to sheathe their daggers and take each of them by the
elbows to help her on, and as if to crown their misfortunes, a cold,
drenching rain began to fall. It put the finishing touch also to the
brigands’ ill-humour, and they pushed and dragged their shivering
captives roughly along, muttering angrily at every step.

“Maurice, tell them we can’t go any faster!” cried Zoe at last. “We
are keeping up with them on these awful roads, and we can’t do more.”

“Oh, that’s not what’s the matter,” returned Maurice from behind, in a
Mark-Tapleyan tone of voice. “They’re calling us names for making them
turn out of their nice comfortable camp and go wandering about the
mountains in the dark and the wet. They say they have taken such care
of us, and treated us as honoured guests, and our ingratitude is
something detestable.”

“Anybody might think we wanted to come!” said Zoe.

“Well, it certainly is our fault in a way,” said Maurice. “If we
didn’t exist, or weren’t here, they wouldn’t be running away from
Wylie.”

They relapsed into silence again, and the grumbling curses of the
brigands were the only sounds to be heard above the plashing of
footsteps and the swish of the rain. The girls were half-unconscious
with fatigue and want of sleep, and stumbled on in a kind of waking
dream. It must have been drawing near dawn, though the blank black
skies showed no sign of it, when the brigands paused again, in the
shelter of a clump of stunted trees, hardly more than bushes, and the
scouts glided forth on their errand. They returned unexpectedly soon,
and their report called forth ominous curses.

“There are soldiers holding the path in front,” explained Maurice in a
whisper to the girls. “Wylie knows what he is doing, bad luck to him!
He’s got us between two fires, with all his precautions.”

For the moment it looked as though Wylie had actually brought about
the death of his friends, for the brigands were now thoroughly roused.
“Kill the European dogs, kill them and get rid of them!” was the
murmur. “They have brought us to this pass. Let us kill them and leave
their bodies here on the track for their friend to find.” Daggers were
once more unsheathed, and revolvers drawn.

“Why don’t you pray? Are you an atheist?” demanded Eirene of Zoe,
breaking off in the middle of a catalogue of saints, whose aid she was
audibly imploring.

“No; I am praying,” said Zoe, but she felt curiously resigned. Death
would be such a rest after this dreadful night. But the reference to
Wylie, which Maurice translated under pressure, disturbed her. He
would never be able to forgive himself if he realised what he had
done. If only one of them could escape, it might make him a little
less miserable. She sat up with an effort, and grasped Maurice’s arm.

“Maurice, even if they kill us, you might escape. You can run, and
your things don’t cling so. We will make as much fuss as possible, to
give you time to get away to the soldiers.”

“Don’t be an owl,” said Maurice brusquely. “Is it likely? I ask you,
is it likely?”

“But so much depends on you. We don’t signify.”

“What depends on Maurice?” demanded Eirene, with keen curiosity. Zoe
recollected herself, in part.

“Oh, well, he is the last of the name, you know,” she said.

“The last of the name of Smith?” asked Eirene innocently.

“No--er--the last of our Smiths,” Zoe managed to say, and broke into
hopeless laughter, until Maurice shook her, and asked her whether she
wanted the brigands to think that terror had driven her mad. It seemed
that their fate was no longer in suspense, since Milosch, of all
people, had come to the rescue. This was not through any softness of
heart, but because, representing, as he did, the Thracian committee
which directed the brigands’ movements, he had been able to paint in
vivid terms the wrath and disappointment which would pervade that
august body on the discovery that the prisoners whose ransom was to
have added so largely to its funds had simply been wasted.

“There must be a way up the mountain,” he said, “so that we could turn
aside from the path without even approaching the Roumi dogs.”

“There is,” said Zeko, “but it is such a way that a man must cling to
the rocks with both hands and his toes and his teeth. How can women
climb it?”

“Women can do what they are obliged to do,” said Milosch, with his
evil grin.

“This settles it,” said Zoe, as Maurice translated the words. “If our
lives depend on our climbing up there, or even walking any farther,
why, we shall have to be killed. Look, Maurice, our moccasins are cut
to pieces, and my feet are bleeding--so are Eirene’s. We can’t walk
another step, and you can tell them so.”

It was unnecessary for Maurice to speak, however, for one of the
brigands came in to report, with much indignation, that Zoe’s feet had
left spots of blood on the track, which the rain had not quite washed
off, and the rest were forced to perceive that the girls were really
incapable of walking farther. Again there were suggestions of a short
and sharp way out of the difficulty, and again Milosch interposed as
_deus ex machinâ_.

“You say that these Roumi swine have two sentries on the path, and
that the rest are sheltering in the ruined hut below? Well, be sure
that the sentries will join the rest as soon as it is daylight, for
what sane man would stand out in the rain when he might be in shelter?
They will not expect us to break through by day, and if the saints
only grant them sleep after they have eaten, we may pass without their
even seeing us. If they should seek to prevent us, we can use the
prisoners as a screen against their bullets, and escape ourselves.”

“It is well said,” remarked the chief, whose own financial stake in
the matter was considerable. “At least we will do what we can to save
the ransom. We will remain here for the present.”

The prospect was not very cheering, for the rain dripped down from the
sodden trees on the soaked ground, and everything was wet. Maurice
took matters into his own hands. Gathering together some fallen
branches, he arranged them on the driest spot he could find, and asked
Zeko for matches. The brigands laughed grimly at the request.

“If you must kill the ladies, you may as well do it at once,” he
responded promptly, “and not leave them to die of cold and wet. No one
could distinguish smoke in this mist, even if there was any one
looking out.”

Unless the suggestion had accorded with the brigands’ own
inclinations, it would probably still have been scouted, but in the
prevailing cold and discomfort the idea of a fire appealed to them
powerfully, and they collected more sticks, and laboured strenuously
to get the wet wood to burn. It was a very smoky and cheerless fire,
at best, but it put a little warmth into the girls’ shivering frames,
and Maurice toasted the soaked morsels of black bread and dingy cheese
which were thrown to them, and induced them to eat. The brigands had
been consulting together during the meal, and at its close Stoyan
called Maurice aside, addressing him in a reasonable,
“man-and-brother” way, which amused him by its cool assumption that
their interests were the same.

“You must see clearly,” he said, “that we cannot remain here. At any
cost we must pass the soldiers in front. Out of consideration for your
sisters we have refrained from dragging them up the rocks, and you
must, therefore, make them understand that they must walk a little way
farther. Let them bind up their feet, so as to leave no track, and
once beyond the pass we shall be able to procure horses for them. We
are bound for a safe hiding-place, where they will find rest and
comfort, and women to attend upon them. Surely you can see that it is
better for them to make this slight effort than to be left dead upon
the road?”

“I do quite see it,” responded Maurice, after a moment’s thought. It
was clear that, for the moment, their interests did indeed lie with
those of the brigands, since any attempt to reach the soldiers or
delay the march meant death. He went back to the girls and explained
things to them, and they set to work wearily to tie up their wounded
feet in such rags as they could muster, replacing the torn moccasins
over them. Presently one of the scouts came in to report that the
Roumi sentries had rejoined their comrades at the ruined hut, thus
leaving the way above clear, and the march was resumed immediately,
the girls tottering as best they could on either side of Maurice, who
alone had an arm to spare for them. The brigands had all unslung their
rifles and looked to the cartridges, and were proceeding in a rough
open order, with the scouts a little way in advance. Suddenly they
came to a standstill, with an involuntary gasp of astonishment. Facing
them, climbing the slope from the ruined hut, were the Roumi soldiers,
whose surprise was equally patent with their own. It would have been
difficult to say which party had less expected to see the other, but
the brigands were prepared for the emergency, while the soldiers were
not. Their rifles were slung on their backs for convenience in
climbing, and they were scattered on the face of the slope. A sharp
order from the brigand chief confronted them with the muzzles of
twenty rifles, and with a howl of horror they turned and fled. Half of
the band pursued them--the rest remaining to guard the
prisoners--firing off their rifles and whooping with delight. The
pursuit was not a long one, for Stoyan’s whistle recalled his men
quickly, and sending one back to discover whether the sounds of the
skirmish had penetrated to the force with which Wylie was, he led the
rest forward for some distance, till they came to a place where two
tracks met. One man was sent on down the lower and left-hand path,
while the main body disposed themselves among the rocks, well out of
sight of the road, and Milosch, approaching the prisoner, said to
Zoe--

“You give ze Voivoda cutting.”

This mild horticultural request was so surprising that Zoe looked at
him in perplexity, whereupon he pointed impatiently to her dress. The
neat striped flannel coat and skirt on which she had so long ago
prided herself was now in sadly reduced circumstances, the skirt
especially having been curtailed to the most approved “mountaineering
length.”

“Oh, give them a piece of yours, Eirene, can’t you?” she said. “You
really have more left.”

“Oh no, it is yours he wants,” said Eirene quickly. “He thinks Captain
Wylie will recognise it.”

Zoe glared at her for this tactless speech, and reluctantly tore off a
strip which was hanging loose between two of the brown patches she had
put in. Watching the chief with some curiosity, she saw that he tore
it in two, and dexterously entangled one piece in a thorny bush some
little way up the ascending path on the right, and then went on up the
hill, evidently intending to do the same with the other farther on.
The intention of the manœuvre was obvious, and the prisoners did not
know whether to sigh for the deception to be practised on Wylie, or to
rejoice that his perilous presence was to be removed from them. After
some time, the brigand who had gone down the hill reappeared with an
ancient horse, very thin and almost blind, and the girls were, without
ceremony, mounted one behind the other, with the rugs as an apology
for a saddle. They and Maurice were then blindfolded, and the descent
began, the brigands displaying their usual distrust of smooth or soft
ground, and leading the horse down the rockiest places, which was good
strategy, but made exceedingly uncomfortable riding. For once, each
girl was really thankful that her companion’s eyes were unable to see
the shifts to which she was put in order to maintain her balance. At
length the descent became somewhat less steep, and the old horse
stumbled gallantly along a fairly level track, his two riders almost
asleep, in spite of their uneasy position. They stopped with a jerk at
last, and heard some one pouring forth an exciting narrative to the
chief. Maurice came up to them softly.

“It is the fellow who was sent back,” he said. “He followed the
retreating soldiers until they came to the village, and met Wylie’s
force just setting out in this direction. Wylie meant to sweep the
country, you see, and if the sentries above here had not left their
posts, the two detachments must have caught the brigands between them.
Of course, it’s just as well for us personally that they didn’t.”

“What did Captain Wylie say?” asked Zoe.

“When he heard we had broken through? Oh, Demo says, ‘Their own
Bimbashi beat the flying soldiers with his sword, but the Capitan
cursed them in bitter, biting words, far worse than any beating, for
if the evil eye ever rested on any man, it did on them!’”

“If I were Captain Wylie, I should curse myself,” said Eirene
succinctly, just as Milosch summoned her and Zoe to dismount. Followed
by Maurice, they were led a wearying round, in and out of doors, up
and down stairs, into a tower, a farmyard, a granary, and a kitchen
(as they judged by the smells that met them), until they were
hopelessly confused as to the direction in which they had come. Then
they were pushed in at a low door, and the bandages were suddenly
removed from their eyes. They were in darkness, but other senses than
that of sight convinced them that they stood in a cattle-stable.

“Oh, Maurice, the dirt!” gasped Zoe, as her foot sank into yielding
mud.

“Go on! go on!” cried Milosch behind, prodding Maurice in the back
with the muzzle of his rifle--an action which has a distinctly
disquieting effect upon the person acted on--and Zeko’s voice in front
called them to come forward. Following the direction of the words,
they saw a faint glimmer of grey, defining the shape of another
doorway, with the outline of Zeko’s beckoning arm dark against it.
Stumbling through the mud, they reached the threshold, and found
themselves in a cave or underground room hewn out in the rock. Part of
the ceiling was of rock, the rest, through which the light glimmered,
was apparently the badly fitting flooring of a room above. Sacks and
large earthenware jars, with various boxes, seemed to show that the
place was the receptacle for all the household valuables, but there
was nothing that could be called furniture. Zeko shut the door with a
bang, and they heard him piling up fodder--or something else that
deadened sound--against it on the outside. They were imprisoned
underground.




 CHAPTER XII.
 THE DIVINE FIGURE OF THE NORTH.

 “Dear Wylie,--I am sorry to have to tell you that in consequence of
 the action of the authorities in sending troops against them, Stoyan
 and his band have now increased the ransom they demand for us to
 twenty thousand pounds. They also say that if the pursuit continues,
 first one and then another of us will be killed, and the ransom for
 the remaining one will be raised by five thousand pounds a-week. I
 tell you honestly that the efforts of the troops can have no result
 beyond irritating the brigands and making our position worse, and that
 we are at this moment hidden where I believe no power on earth could
 find us. The ladies agree with me, very reluctantly.--Yours truly,

                                             “Maurice Smith.
                                             “Zoe Smith.
                                             “Eirene Smith.”


This was written on the upper half of a sheet from Zoe’s large
note-book, and at the foot appeared the following, which could be torn
off before the recipient made the first portion public:--

“For goodness’ sake, Wylie, drop it. Your intentions are excellent,
but they don’t seem to come off. The girls are half-dead with
exhaustion after the way you have been hunting us about, and we are at
present cheerfully accommodated underground, with only the faintest
glimmer of light. I couldn’t tell you where we are if I would, and I
wouldn’t if I could. For some reason or other the brigands have taken
a dislike to you, and if you persist in staying up here, I am given to
understand that you will find yourself confronted with our dead bodies
in various uncomfortable attitudes. Cut away to Therma and hurry up
that ransom. This is the kindest thing you can do for us.”

On his return from the vain pursuit of the brigands which followed the
meeting with the routed detachment, Wylie discovered this letter
pinned with a dagger to the doorpost of the house where he had taken
up his quarters. None of the villagers had seen who brought it, and no
one could offer any suggestion on the subject, but whether the
universal ignorance was real, or the result of a secret understanding
with the brigands, did not appear. The letter had the desired effect,
sending Wylie back to Therma in something more nearly approaching
panic than he had ever known. He was not as reckless of the lives of
his friends as he had appeared, but he had undoubtedly brought them
into imminent peril, though his course had been adopted in utter
desperation. His first appearance at Therma, bearing the story of what
had happened and the demand for a ransom, had been the signal for the
commencement of a wild tragi-comedy of irresponsibility. The Roumi
authorities declared flatly that there were no brigands in Emathia, so
that it was obviously impossible that the travellers could have been
carried off by brigands. The British representatives, to whom Wylie
appealed at the same time, cherished grave doubts as to the wisdom of
paying a ransom, since no British traveller in Emathia would be safe
after such a precedent had been set. Professor Panagiotis, torn by
conflicting emotions, proved almost equally unsatisfactory. He had
found himself of late subjected to a disquieting espionage, which
filled him with fear lest his plans had in some way been divined. In
such a case, it seemed to him that his only chance was to grip his
important secret more tightly than ever. Lest Wylie should make use of
it to bring pressure on any of the Governments concerned, he kept it
even from him, pooh-poohing his reminder of the explanations Maurice
had promised him, and showing an uneasy curiosity on the subject of
Eirene, for whose existence he could not account. He volunteered,
indeed, to write to Maurice’s bankers, asking them to advance the
money for the ransom, with the natural result that they demanded
either a cheque signed by Maurice or an interview with Wylie and a
sight of his authority, and Wylie could not bring himself to leave
Emathia while his friends’ fate hung in the balance. The Professor’s
sole useful contribution to the debate was the conviction that the
outrage had been perpetrated by a band of Thracian marauders, with
which the newspapers in his interest made Europe ring. The Thracian
Government, approached on the subject, replied with virtuous
indignation that its attitude was perfectly correct. It had always
studiously discouraged--in the most official manner--the formation of
such bands, and refused them permission to cross the frontier into
Emathia. If the reprehensible activity of private persons had managed
to organise a band, the authorities viewed it with entire detachment,
and the Roumi Government was welcome to do as it liked with the
members, when it caught them.

This acknowledgment that there might be foreign, though not native,
brigands on the sacred soil of Emathia stirred the Roumi officials to
a pitch of activity positively dangerous. Urged on by Professor
Panagiotis and his adherents, they sent troops into the hills, and
loudly proclaimed their intention of sweeping the miscreants from the
face of the earth, and rescuing the captives without fee or reward.
Into the vortex of this expedition Wylie was whirled, partly by the
demand of the authorities that he should accompany the troops and
behold the vengeance exacted, partly by his own hope that he might be
able to make the measures taken effectual. His friend Palmer, smarting
under the loss of the faithful Haji Ahmad, had willingly joined him in
a bold journey through the heart of the brigands’ country, in the hope
that the luggage so lavishly displayed would prove a bait sufficient
to ensure their being carried off also, when the best trackers in the
country, provided by Professor Panagiotis, would follow them up, and
thus discover the brigands’ stronghold. Demo’s recognition of Wylie in
his disguise had prevented this, but the journey had its fruit in the
discovery of the boot-tracks of the captives, and thus enabled Wylie
to lay his plans for a systematic search. As Maurice had conjectured,
it was the torrent-bed, the use of which as a path he had not
suspected, which had thrown him out when he felt certain that he had
the brigands safe in one particular group of hills, and the
carelessness of the detachment which had been sent on to hold the pass
enabled his prey to slip through his fingers. Thus baffled, he had no
alternative but to hurry back to Therma, in compliance with Maurice’s
earnest request, only to find fresh discouragements awaiting him.
Before leaving for the hills, he had written a full account of the
capture to Maurice’s bankers, enclosing a certified copy of the first
letter signed by the three captives, in the hope that they might be
induced to depart from their attitude of severe correctness. Their
answer had now arrived, making it evident that the worthy country
gentlemen, who had known Maurice and Zoe all their lives, and their
parents and grandparents before them, regarded the intrusion of Eirene
into the letter as evidence of a not very cleverly constructed plot,
concocted, it was to be presumed, by Wylie and Professor Panagiotis,
for the purpose of extorting money. Whether they imagined the
Professor and Wylie were holding the captives in durance, or doubted
their being in durance at all, or what they thought Eirene had to do
with the matter, they did not say, but they wound up a lengthy refusal
to do anything without seeing Wylie, with the coldly sarcastic remark
that the Roumi Government was obviously the proper channel from which
to obtain the ransom.

“Why can’t the old idiots see that it’s a matter of life and death?”
mused Wylie bitterly, as he read the letter on the terrace of his
hotel. “I’m not going cap in hand to them to be treated like a
pickpocket and sent off with a flea in my ear, while the Smiths are
being massacred. I’d rather pay the money myself. I wonder if I could
manage to raise it in the time? I don’t see where it’s to come from.
Or is there any one else I could worry into taking action?”

He thought over the long list of people to whom he had written urgent
letters--every one he had ever heard of who was likely to have
influence with the press or with any of the Governments interested in
Emathia--and realised wrathfully that, though his journalistic appeals
had produced a good deal of frothy rhetoric and bloodthirsty
declamation in the columns of newspapers of the baser sort, the
practical effect appeared to be _nil_. True, an artist on the staff of
the ‘Plastic,’ who happened to be in the neighbourhood--as distances
go in Eastern Europe--had been ordered to the scene of the capture,
which was now, on the well-established principle of the steed and the
stable-door, kept constantly patrolled by police, and had made many
sketches of the localities concerned, but without stirring the placid
blood of the public to any extraordinary heat. He had moved on to
Therma now, and was staying at the hotel, and as Wylie halted
irresolutely in his anger and perplexity outside the window of the
smoking-room, he came out and joined him.

“I say, you don’t mind my speaking to you, do you?” he asked, in a
pleasant, boyish voice. “I know you’re the man who was captured with
the Smiths, and I want to find out something about them. I’m sick of
sketching a set of rotten roadsides--might as well be a camera at
once--and there’s not a sensation in the whole lot. What I’m thinking
of is a full-page drawing of the outrage itself--call it a fancy
picture if you like, but that’s the sort of thing that tells. Besides,
if I work up the figures from your description, it’s not a fancy
picture. Do you mind?”

“I don’t mind what I do that’s likely to give the slightest help in
rescuing them,” said Wylie emphatically.

“I know. Horribly rough on them and you too--all this red tape. Let’s
go ahead, then. What sort of a chap is Smith?”

“Cambridge man, usual style, nothing particular about him, but an
awfully good sort. His eldest sister told me that he got a gold medal
for poetry this spring, but you’d never think it to look at him.”

“A gold medal? Not for an English poem? I was there myself, and there
was no Smith in. My young brother got a medal for a Greek epigram, and
he was so keen on my seeing him in all his glory that I ran down for
the day. Took the opportunity to get half a page of sketches for the
‘Daily Plastic,’ too, as the affair isn’t much known. They keep the
date dark lest the men should get in and rag--so my brother told me.
Now what was the chap’s name who got the English medal? It was a St
Saviour’s man, and the Master was so proud he talked of nothing else
for a week.”

“Miss Smith told me her brother got it,” said Wylie, in the tone which
implies that there is no more to be said.

“But there must be a mistake somewhere. Look here; I believe I have
that very sketch-book in my room. I’ll get it, and we can see the
fellow’s name.”

He vanished indoors, and presently returned breathless, flicking over
the leaves of a well-filled sketch-book.

“Here it is!” he cried. “Teffany! I knew there was something queer
about the name.” He put the book into his companion’s hands, and Wylie
found himself confronted with an unmistakable portrait of Maurice in
cap and gown, wearing a rather strained smile, and gripping a roll of
paper very tight. In close proximity was a sketch of Professor
Panagiotis, all alert attention, bending forward to listen.

“Why, that’s Smith!” cried Wylie, “and this----”

“Yes, it’s awfully rummy, isn’t it? That’s the old johnny who hangs
out at Kallimeri, close here. It gave me quite a shock when I met him
in the street, but then I remembered that my brother told me he was
some Greek bigwig. Then my man is your man, after all? I say, this is
something like a joke!”

“But what possible reason can he have had for changing his name?”
cried Wylie, trying to recall anything that ought to have prepared him
for the discovery.

“And there’s another thing,” said the artist, who was enjoying himself
hugely. “He’s got a sister too many. Teffany has only one, I know. She
came up to Girtham at the same time that he entered at St Saviour’s,
and they were called ‘The Orphans’ everywhere, because they used to go
about together in deep mourning. It was for their grandfather, though.
Their father was killed in the Soudan years before, and their mother
died from the shock. So where does the other girl come in?”

“Of course she is only a half-sister; I knew that.”

“But younger than either of them, you say? Oh, this is
brain-splitting! She must be a cousin.”

“Really,” said Wylie stiffly, “I see no reason for us to trouble about
the matter. No one ever doubted that she was their sister.”

“Well, we seem to have come upon a nice little double mystery. Look
here, monsieur,” the artist cried to a man who was standing just
inside the smoking-room, “come and adjudicate. What reason could a man
have, whose name wasn’t Smith, for calling himself Smith, when he was
doing nothing more heinous than coming with his sisters to stay with
Professor Panagiotis?”

“English, of course?” said the stranger, joining them, and speaking
with a slight foreign accent. “Why need one seek a reason, then? The
pseudo-Smith is rich--perhaps noble--at home, and he desires a new
sensation. Therefore he obtains one by travelling _incognito_.”

“Well, I suppose Teffany is comfortably off”--the stranger’s eyelid
flickered as the artist spoke--“but there are no titles in the family,
that I know of. Why in the world should he do it?”

“The natural modesty of the British character,” suggested the
stranger.

“And there’s another thing. Why should he call a girl his sister who
isn’t his sister?”

“If you ask me,” said the stranger waggishly, “I should say that it
was some one else’s sister.”

“Oh, but two of them?” cried the artist. “Or, if one was genuine, how
do you account for her tolerating the bogus one?”

“Look here,” said Wylie, “that will do. You, and Smith’s--I mean
Teffany’s--bankers, and Professor Panagiotis, all persist that there
can’t be a second sister. I tell you there is, for I have seen her and
talked to her. I have the honour of both the Miss Smiths’--the Miss
Teffanys’, I mean--acquaintance, and whatever stupid mystery you may
manage to cook up, I’m certain there’s the most ordinary explanation
if we only knew it. I don’t want any more jokes on the subject.”

“Awfully sorry,” said the artist hastily, as the stranger withdrew
with a smile; “but it is funny, you know.”

“To you, perhaps. Who’s your grinning friend?”

“A Greek--Mitsopoulo his name is--good sort of chap. Knows the ropes,
puts me up to all sorts of things. His sister is married to the
Scythian Consul-General--frightfully handsome woman. But he’s only
staying here.”

“I don’t know why you called him in,” said Wylie uneasily. “We don’t
want Scythia mixed up in this business.”

The artist stared at him. “Oh, I say,” he laughed, “there’s no doubt
where you come from, is there? ‘Keep your powder dry, and hate a
Scythian like the devil’--that’s about the mark of you North-West
Frontier men, isn’t it?”

“What do you know about the North-West Frontier?” growled Wylie. “I’m
off to Professor Panagiotis to get this thing cleared up. I shall end
by wringing the old blighter’s neck for him, I know.”

“So long!” said the artist pacifically, for he had not yet got all the
information he wanted, and he settled down to a sketch for his
picture, leaving the girls’ faces blank, while Wylie, refusing the
offers of donkey-boys and cab-drivers, tramped off to Kallimeri. The
Professor had learnt to dread his coming, and distinguished on this
occasion in the very sound of his footsteps fresh cause for alarm.
Wylie gave him no opportunity of denying the identification
established by the sketch, but demanded bluntly the reason of the
change of name, and why he had not been told of it before. The only
course was to explain the whole of the circumstances, and this the
Professor took.

“You see, then,” he ended, “that not a breath of this must creep out.
Our young friend stands in the way of both Scythian and
Thraco-Dardanian ambitions, and if it was known who he was, it would
be fatally easy to arrange for his death--at the hands of the
brigands, by a fall in the mountains, by a shot from a Roumi rifle. It
would occur so naturally that there would be no room for inquiry, and
his sister, who would otherwise inherit his claims, would share his
fate. Now do you see why I kept you in the dark? It was for their
sake. I feared that by some inadvertence”--Wylie moved angrily--“Well,
now that you know the truth, and what hangs upon your silence, you
will see that nothing must be said. There is a dangerous man at your
hotel--Nicetas Mitsopoulo, a Greek traitor in Scythian employ--beware
of him.”

“Your warning comes a little late. The gentleman you mention was
present when I discovered the truth.”

Professor Panagiotis flung up his hands in despair. “Then Maurice
Teffany and his sister are as good as dead! My hopes are destroyed.”

“Don’t blither about your hopes,” said Wylie savagely, “but think what
we can do. What chance have we of saving them?”

“If we can raise the ransom by the very day stipulated--the brigands
are generally faithful to their word--but if it is an hour late----”

“Then the ransom must be raised, by hook or by crook. Can you advance
it? I will give you my bond for all I am worth, and I am certain Smith
will regard the rest as a debt of honour.”

“Alas, no! It is not in my power,” groaned the Professor.

“Nonsense! you are well known to be a rich man. How much can you lay
your hands upon in ten days?”

“I--I must explain to you,” said the Professor diffidently, “that
events have advanced since I had the good fortune to discover Mr
Teffany. In view of the happy prospects of the Greek cause, I have
felt justified in promoting a certain degree of organisation among its
adherents--enabling them to defend their homes against their ruthless
Slavic assailants----”

“And institute reprisals, no doubt?” said Wylie. “This means, of
course, that you have been arming the Emathian Greeks against the
Slavs, by way of improving matters?”

“And the cost has been very heavy,” pursued the Professor, with
humility, “and one large consignment of--defence weapons--fell,
unfortunately, into the hands of one of the Thracian committees, so
that I am actually straitened.”

“Well, can you beg, borrow, or steal five thousand pounds by the end
of next week? I think I ought to be able to manage the other fifteen
thousand, by realising everything I have in the world. If not, you
must scrape together the difference. At any cost we must stop Mr
Mitsopoulo’s little games.”

Had Wylie been present at a certain discussion at the Scythian
Consulate that evening, he would have realised that Nicetas Mitsopoulo
was playing even a deeper game than he imagined. The Greek arrived at
a private door, which was opened to him by the Consul-General himself,
a big, fair man, whose bluff exterior concealed a very serviceable
share of diplomatic _finesse_.

“Welcome, Nikita Feodorovitch!” he said pleasantly. “You will find
Chariclea ready for you. Curiously enough, immediately after your
message arrived, a sudden headache prevented her from going to the
party at the Cimbrian Consul’s.”

M. Mitsopoulo pushed past his brother-in-law rather impatiently, for
the Consul-General was always ready to find amusement, such as the
professional plotter had long since outgrown, in these tricks of the
trade. Much more in sympathy with him was his sister, Madame Ladoguin,
or Chariclea Feodorovna, as she was called by her Scythian
acquaintances. A handsome woman in a loose Levantine dress, with her
dark hair hanging below her waist in two heavy plaits, she awaited him
on a cushioned divan in her boudoir, with cigarettes and the
ever-ready samovar at hand. M. Ladoguin lounged in after him, and sat
down at a little distance, ready to act as friend of the court.

“This has been a day of events and surprises,” said Mitsopoulo,
accepting a glass of tea, with thin slices of lemon floating in it,
from his sister. “I have made such progress that I am almost
bewildered, and I bring the results of my labours to you, Chariclea,
that you may check them and assure me I have not deceived myself.”

“I will scrutinise them as rigorously as if they were the report of a
Reform Scheme,” she answered, with a lazy smile.

“That is just what I want. You have guessed, I am sure, Chariclea,
that my visit here was in connection with the disappearance, which was
not made known to the public, of a young lady of high rank. All the
indications seemed to point to her having escaped to America, but as
the Greek Panagiotis was known to have tampered with her father, it
was thought well to watch for her here. I placed the amiable
Panagiotis under surveillance, which I fear he has found inconvenient,
but as it did not appear that he was either holding or expecting any
communication with the Princess, I was about to withdraw it. Then,
only a week ago, one of my agents brought word that a breast-ornament
of gold and rubies, of a unique Byzantine design, had been offered for
sale secretly by a Jew in this city. The description corresponded with
that of one of the jewels which had disappeared with the Princess, and
I authorised the man to secure it at any cost, but, alas! at the first
hint of inquiry it disappeared again, and has probably been broken up.
Until to-day, therefore, I thought it probable that the Princess had
eluded my vigilance and was in hiding here, subsisting by the sale of
her jewels until she found it safe to communicate with Panagiotis.” He
paused impressively.

“Yes, and now?” asked Mme. Ladoguin.

“To-day I was summoned to assist at a conversation between a brainless
artist staying at the hotel, and the English officer who was captured
with the renowned Smiths----”

“Are you quite sure you were not assisting before you were summoned,
Nikita?” laughed the Consul-General. His brother-in-law passed over
the question as unworthy of an answer.

“--And I discovered a very curious fact, vouched for by three separate
authorities, that one of the ladies passing as Miss Smith is not a
Miss Smith at all. Mr and Miss Smith have no sister, and Panagiotis,
with whom they were to stay, did not expect a second lady guest.”

“Well?” demanded Mme. Ladoguin, her eyes glowing sombrely.

“The idea came to me in a flash, but it was too improbable to accept
without investigation. I went at once to the station, and by great
good fortune succeeded in finding the guard of the train that was
wrecked near Przlepka. Otherwise I might have had to wait two or three
days. He recollected the party perfectly, and described them--the
brother an ordinary, impassive Englishman, one sister vivacious in the
wooden English way, but the other totally different. He said himself
that he would have guessed her to be a Scythian, as also the aunt who
was killed in the accident. With another happy flash, I asked him if
he had happened to visit the aunt’s grave at Przlepka. He had done so,
and the name upon the stone was Evdotia Vladimirovna. That was the
Christian name of Madame Lyofsky, the lady-in-waiting who vanished
with the Princess.”

“Excellent! Well done! Continue, pray!” cried Mme. Ladoguin, clapping
her hands softly.

“I could get no more from the man, for he had, of course, only been
able to observe the Smiths from Tatarjé to Przlepka. To obtain
further information, I must go myself to Tatarjé and question the
car-attendant on the Orient Express, who must have plenty to tell. But
at present, what is your view of the case, my dear Chariclea?”

“There can only be one view,” she responded quickly. “The Princess
fell in with these Smiths in Paris, and either by bribery or entreaty,
induced them to adopt Mme. Lyofsky and herself as members of their
party, flattering herself that she would thus escape discovery.”

“So I should have thought but for something else that I learned
to-day. The man Smith and his sister are in reality no more Smith than
the Princess is. Their true name is Teffany.”

“Well?” asked the Consul-General curiously.

“Teffany--which is Theophanis,” said M. Mitsopoulo. His sister sprang
up from her cushions.

“What! Nicetas, you don’t mean----”

“I mean that Panagiotis has succeeded, where his predecessors failed,
in unearthing or manufacturing an English representative of the senior
male line of the descendants of John Theophanis.”

“But why then trouble himself with the Princess?” asked M. Ladoguin
helplessly.

“Oh, that’s clear enough,” was the contemptuous reply of his wife.
“She is to marry the claimant.”

“Now there I can’t agree with you, Chariclea,” said her brother.
“Panagiotis is far too wise for that. The united claims of the two
would be absolutely unassailable, and there would be no room for him.
He might choose to arrange such a marriage by slow degrees, inventing
hindrances and delays so as to make his own services appear
indispensable, but it would be madness to begin by throwing the two
young people together.”

“But we can hardly charge the worthy Professor with the railway
accident and the capture by the brigands, can we?” asked M. Ladoguin,
laughing. “We know better than that.”

“No, that was certainly unforeseen on his part. But why plot so
clumsily as to let them travel by the same train?”

“He must have had some scheme for separating them as soon as they
became interested in one another,” suggested Mme. Ladoguin, without
much conviction.

“Now I am going to propound a common-sense view of the matter, since
you two clever people are at a loss,” said her husband. “What if
Panagiotis has washed his hands of the girl--the Princess, I
mean--since he discovered his male heir; and what if she took the
journey entirely on her own account, enraged at the neglect of her
claims? That would account for his not expecting her. The meeting with
the Smiths would then be a pure coincidence.”

“Absurd!” said Mme. Ladoguin sharply, following the sound Higher
Critical rule of rejecting the obvious. “Do you suggest that these
young people, whose interests are diametrically opposed, fell in love
at first sight, like characters of Shakespeare, and agreed to--to pool
their respective claims?”

“Possibly. Isn’t it more reasonable than to suppose that Panagiotis
brought them together and explained the situation, with a view to a
State marriage?”

“Stop!” cried Mitsopoulo suddenly. “Adopting the coincidence theory
provisionally, must we suppose that the situation is explained at all?
In my view, Panagiotis arranged the disappearance of the Princess, but
she was too impatient to await the date he had fixed. He had intended
to produce her a month or so hence, when the young man was entirely in
his power; but naturally he says nothing to either of them. She
escapes sooner than he wished, and falls in with the other claimant
and his sister in Paris. There was the coincidence. Now, is it likely
that either party would even be aware of the other’s existence, since
it is to the interest of Panagiotis to keep them in ignorance for his
own purposes? Therefore, why should they confide in each other at
all?”

“Oh, but everything must have come out since--or at least, half of
everything,” said M. Ladoguin, generalising unwisely on a common-sense
basis. “The man and his sister, who are new to the idea of their
dignity, could not possibly keep silence.” Mitsopoulo nodded,
remembering Zoe’s confidence to Wylie about the gold medal, and his
brother-in-law went on, much encouraged. “With the Princess it is
different. She must be capable of determined secrecy, from the skill
with which she concealed her preparations for escape, and she has long
believed herself the heir of the Eastern Empire. Finding herself
confronted with a claim antagonistic and superior to her own, what
will be her impulse? Will it not be to retain her secret haughtily,
watching for the chance of crushing her rival? I should say that if
you want her back, you will find her thankful to come.”

“Do you want her back?” asked Mme. Ladoguin.

“Most certainly,” replied her brother; “she is an invaluable asset,
tracing an uninterrupted Greek and Orthodox descent from John
Theophanis. The Englishman’s claim is the best by the ordinary law of
Europe, but would break down hopelessly when tried by the Imperial
family statutes. She ought to have been married long ago, and her
claim carried into the Scythian Imperial house; but she is in a
troublesome position--too important and yet not important enough. It
is believed that she aspired to an alliance with the Emperor
himself--and if I had had the direction of affairs I fancy I should
have settled it in that way. But it was otherwise decided, and she
rejected with contumely the Grand Duke Ivan Petrovitch, who was
suggested to her as a suitor. She also took matters into her own
hands, or Panagiotis persuaded her that she did.”

“Then she must be taken care of, I suppose,” drawled Mme. Ladoguin,
“which is a pity, or she might have been disposed of with the other
inconveniences. They are merely inconveniences, are they not? A
judicious massacre, now, or an accident with the dynamite which these
reprehensible bands of brigands manage somehow to get hold of?”

“No, I think not,” said her brother, after a moment’s reflection. “You
forget Panagiotis, and that blue-eyed swashbuckler who was captured
with them. They will make out that we were anxious to get rid of the
man and his claims, and there will be unpleasantness. What must be
done is to make him confess the baselessness of his pretensions. He
must own that he was tempted by Panagiotis to put himself forward as
a Theophanis, without the slightest ground for the assertion. That
will dispose of both him and his sister. How the details are to be
arranged we must discuss another day.”

“I should recommend the monastery of Hadgi-Antoniou if you want any
one kept out of the way for an indefinite time,” smiled M. Ladoguin.

“Just so; and plenty of palm-oil to obviate any difficulties. I must
get an order for funds from Pavelsburg,” said Mitsopoulo.

Wylie also was seeking funds at that moment. A letter to his lawyers
was directing them to sell out all his securities, and to mortgage to
its utmost value the little Border estate which called him master.
However onerous the conditions, he must have fifteen thousand pounds
in ten days.




 CHAPTER XIII.
 THE FALLING-OUT OF FAITHFUL FRIENDS.

Cheerless though the underground prison might be, it offered a
respite from further journeying, and for the moment the captives could
think of nothing else. Exhausted by the long night spent in tramping
through the rain, the girls asked only for rest, and a sack of corn
for pillow, with a rug for coverlet, furnished as luxurious a couch as
they could need. They were asleep in a moment, and Maurice envied
them. He had chosen his own sleeping-place close to the door, but he
could not rest until he had built up the boxes and sacks into a
barricade which might shelter the girls from prying eyes. It seemed to
him that the noise he made would wake anybody, but Zoe and Eirene
never stirred, and he erected a very fair partition, and retired
thankfully to his own sack and rug on the threshold. He was not
allowed to sleep, however, for a beam of light appeared at the other
end of the cellar, and a voice called him. Rising with much
reluctance, he found that a board of the crazy flooring above had been
lifted, and a basket containing writing materials was being lowered
down, while Milosch instructed him through the hole as to the terms of
the letter he was to write to Wylie. The circumstances might excuse a
certain acerbity in the wording, and Maurice was conscious of a savage
satisfaction as he added his postscript, scarcely able to see, so
drowsy was he. Even when he had finished his letter, it was sent down
to him again that the girls might add their signatures, and he was
obliged to wake them in turn, and actually guide their hands over the
paper. Then at last he was left in peace, and lay down and slept for
eight hours without waking. It was the girls’ voices that roused him
at last. He could hear them talking.

“Do you think they mean to starve us?” murmured Eirene.

“I don’t know. I’m _frightfully_ hungry,” returned Zoe.

The suggestion reminded Maurice that he was very conscious of the
pangs of hunger himself, but it was difficult to see how the fact was
to be brought home to the brigands. On testing the door by repeated
knocks, he found that it was still blocked up on the outside, and he
had nothing with which to reach the ceiling, and so disturb the floor
of the room above. In these circumstances, the bright idea seized him
of rolling about some of the empty jars, which made a most
satisfactory noise, and presently the board was lifted again, and
Milosch ordered the prisoners angrily to be quiet. When the state of
things was explained, he deigned to parley, assuring them that it only
wanted half an hour to sunset, and that as soon as it was twilight
they should be released and bountifully fed, but that for the present
they must keep absolute silence, if they valued their lives. The
reason for this became apparent in the course of one of the longest
half-hours they had ever spent, when the boards above rattled with the
not very distant sound of regular tramping.

“That’s Wylie and his army going home,” said Maurice. “Fancy their
being so close to us! I suppose we must have come back quite near the
village we passed through last night. If the old chap only knew!”

The sound of the tramping died away, the dim religious light which
filtered through the chinks between the boards vanished altogether,
and they waited in darkness until there was a welcome noise at the
door. The fodder which had concealed it was being flung away, and they
were ordered to come out. Passing from the noisome stable, they were
hurried through the yard into the house, and while room was made for
Maurice in the jovial circle of brigands who occupied the stone divans
in a large ground-floor room, deeply interested in the extensive
cooking operations going on over and before an enormous fireplace, the
girls were taken up into the tower they had already visited, and
handed over to the women of the family. The grandmother and two or
three elderly dependants were doing the cooking downstairs, where also
were the men of the house, acting as more or less willing hosts to the
brigands, but there were matrons and girls and children enough to make
the household a puzzle in relationships. The women were shy at first,
but when they saw by the rays of their primitive lamp the plight of
their guests they forgot their timidity. They bathed and bound up
their wounded feet, pressed upon them clean head-handkerchiefs and the
loose embroidered shirts they themselves wore on feast-days, and
brought them a plentiful supply of food. After the meal they made them
comfortable with loose sheepskins upon the divans, and sat upon the
floor to make conversation. The girls had picked up something of the
language by this time--Eirene helping herself out with Scythian
words--and an abundant use of gesture helped towards mutual
comprehension. The prisoners were able to indicate the names of their
respective countries, the manner of their capture, and their
wanderings since that event, while the women expressed their pity and
sympathy, together with their unbiassed opinion of the brigands.

That was the first of five nights passed in the tower, the days being
spent underground, and the curious relations of the brigands with the
rural population became manifest. The peasant-farmer had the privilege
of providing the brigand with food, clothes, shelter if he demanded
it, and intelligence of the doings of the authorities, in return for
which he received protection against rival bands, and was secured
against wilful damage to his property, while the brigands winked at
the prompt disappearance of every article of value from the house and
from the dress of the women when a visit from them was expected. There
was no love lost between protectors and protected, guests and hosts,
for the women had much to say of the ruthless demands of the brigands
for food and clothing when the family had barely enough for
themselves, and laughed at their boast of plundering only the rich.
Money they took from the rich alone, certainly, but if the poor man,
who had no money, tried to hide his last sheep to save it from their
clutches, he might be thankful if he escaped with his life. With all
this, the family were discussing--with as little constraint as if the
priesthood had been the career in question--whether the eldest son of
one of its numerous branches should become a brigand instead of
submitting to the vicissitudes of rural life. Brigandage was the best
profession for an active young man, it was generally agreed, and it
was both a protection and a distinction to have a relation in a
well-known band, but it gave the authorities a pretext for additional
exactions, and if the long course of serving two masters should happen
to end unfortunately, it was not desirable for the chief to have at
hand a hostage for the conduct of the family. Not that the authorities
could do much harm to a band like Stoyan’s, declared the grandmother,
who was the chief advocate of brigandage as a career, for Stoyan had
his own agent, receiving a regular salary, among the underlings of the
Vali himself, who sent him early news of any offensive action that
might be contemplated. It was only when troublesome foreigners rushed
things, as Wylie had done, that the arrangement broke down.

All these things Zoe stored up in her mind for Maurice’s benefit,
against the time when he should appear as the Michael who was to
deliver Emathia from oppression on the one side and lawlessness on the
other. It struck her as almost overpoweringly pathetic that when the
women learned that her father and mother were both dead, they should
ask, scarcely waiting for a reply, “The Roumis killed them, of
course?” but the effect was spoilt when she discovered that they
regarded the inhabitants of a Greek-speaking village near them with a
hatred as rancorous as that which they cherished towards the Moslems
whose name they never mentioned without a curse. It was the irony of
fate that the last representatives of Greek ascendency should be
dependent on these fanatical Slavs for the commonest offices of
kindness, but what hope was there of reconciling the divergent
elements? “If one could spend a lifetime travelling about the country,
and getting to know the people personally, there might be some
chance,” thought Zoe; “but even if there was the time to spare, the
jealousy of the Powers would prevent it.” She was sitting on the
divan, wearing the best clothes of one of the women, who was adding a
border of brown homespun to the much-patched grey skirt, and the woman
looked up and smiled at her. Eirene, who had refused any help rather
abruptly, was sitting close to the lamp, mending her own skirt, having
left Zoe to explain, with much futile gesticulation, that her sister
was very independent, and would insist on doing everything for
herself. “I wonder what would happen if I could make them understand
who we are?” thought Zoe, but she did not try it.

The days in the underground dungeon were long and trying, for the
absence of light prevented the girls from having recourse even to
needlework, and much as they needed rest, they could not sleep all day
as well as all night. On the second day they organised a mutual
entertainment society, or rather Zoe did her part without being asked,
and worried the others into doing theirs. She led off, and also filled
up gaps, with a serial story of such length and complexity that there
seemed no reason for it ever to come to an end, of which Maurice
remarked ungratefully that he knew now why no publishers would have
anything to do with her novels; they feared for their reason if they
were once drawn into examining them. Eirene told Scythian folk-tales,
gathered from her nurses in the very early years before she was
afflicted with English, French, and German governesses simultaneously,
and Maurice drew on his store of Cambridge stories, which was running
very low before the imprisonment ended.

It was not until the sixth day after their night of wandering that
they left the farm, and though the Roumi troops had presumably quitted
the district, they were conducted away with as much precaution as had
been observed in reaching it. Zoe suggested that the brigands feared
their eyes might suffer from the daylight after such a long
deprivation of it, and that this was the reason for blindfolding them
afresh, for they actually quitted the place without having seen it, or
the faces of the inhabitants, by any but artificial light. The women
expressed their condolence and pity loudly, and would have loaded them
with more gifts of food and clothes than they could well carry, but
the brigand chief interfered. They had a long march before them, he
said, and no one was going to carry the prisoners’ parcels for them.
The gifts were therefore reduced to their smallest dimensions, and the
start was made, each of the helpless captives walking between two of
the brigands. To their relief, the track was neither so steep nor so
rough as the one they had followed in reaching the farm, and after two
hours’ walking, their guards removed the handkerchiefs from their
eyes. To their weakened sight, all appeared dark even then, and it was
only by degrees they distinguished that they were in a thick forest,
the trees arching over the narrow path on which they stood. They were
allowed little time to accustom themselves to the half-light, for the
march was continued at once, the trend of the path being uniformly
upward, but the ascent fairly gradual. A brief rest at midday was
welcomed by the girls, who were already flagging, much to the
annoyance of the brigands, and a hasty consultation took place between
Stoyan and his lieutenants. As a result, it was evidently decided not
to attempt to push on as far as had been intended, for the pace was
less severe when they started again, and the halt for the night was
called in a small clearing as early as four o’clock in the afternoon.

Adversity had done wonders in teaching the girls to bear their part in
a backwoods life, and Maurice was no longer left to construct the
usual hut by himself. He cut the poles and fixed them in the ground,
but Zoe and Eirene twisted in and out the smaller branches which
formed both roof and sides, and collected leaves and twigs for beds.
Eirene was openly proud of her handiwork, but for Zoe it was
associated with a regretful thought of Wylie. “What a lot of trouble
we used to give him at first!” she mused; “and we never offered to do
anything for ourselves. He must have thought us disgustingly
helpless.” The recollection that if Wylie had thought so, he had, at
any rate, put a good face on the matter, afforded some comfort, and by
a peculiar process of thought she derived consolation also from the
reflection that on the whole it was better he should think so.

There were no kabobs to cook to-night, for the food brought from the
farm supplied a plentiful supper, but the brigands lighted a fire for
the sake of keeping off wild beasts and evil spirits, and sat round it
in great contentment. The prisoners declined the offer of a fire of
their own, and sat on the ground at the upper part of the clearing,
luxuriously propped against tree trunks, to watch the sunset glow
which pierced the black canopy of leaves and branches overhead. To
Eirene it suggested similar sunsets seen through boughs of pine or
birch on the great plains of Scythia, and as though the magic of the
hour had unloosed her tongue, she began to talk of the long summer
evenings, when there was scarcely any actual night, and she had donned
peasant costume, and attended by the governess who happened to be in
favour at the moment, joined in the games and dances of the peasant
girls on her father’s estate. Maurice listened, fascinated, half by
the suggestion of a new side to Eirene’s character, half by the
conviction that in any disguise she would still infallibly be a queen
among subjects. If the subjects were recalcitrant, so much the worse
for them. He drew her on by questions, laughed at her answers, and
owned that he wished he had been there to take part in the revels--a
suggestion which served to jar upon Zoe, who had been sitting silent.

“I do wish,” she said, opening her eyes wearily, “you wouldn’t disturb
my meditations in this frivolous way. You forget the literary
exigencies of the moment.”

“What are they?” asked Maurice. “Is it particularly literary to go to
sleep leaning against a tree?”

“I said I was meditating,” was the severe answer. “You seem to forget
that as all my note-books have been heartlessly reft from me, I have
to store up all our experiences in my head.”

“Ready for the book? Is it to be a plain tale--or a decorated one--or
a novel?”

“Both,” said Zoe decisively. “I find it would be a waste of good
material to lavish it all on one. The plain tale of our adventures and
sufferings will sell like wildfire, and pay for the novel, which will
be all local colour. I shall keep all the choice bits of folklore and
that sort of thing for it.”

“I know you said once that people always skipped the local colour in
reading a book,” objected Eirene.

“How can they, if it’s all local colour?”

“They needn’t read the book,” said Maurice.

“That’s why I shall need the success of the plain tale to pay for it,”
returned Zoe calmly. “I shall have a _succès d’estime_ with the
novel. And after that, I shall never have to trouble about local
colour again all my life.”

“I really believe,” came in accents of considerable irritation from
Eirene, “that you enjoy being imprisoned in underground dungeons, and
climbing up and down these atrocious hills with your skirts in
ribbons, and wearing horrid moccasins because you have no shoes, and
being cursed and threatened if you stop to rest for a moment, just
because you mean to put it into your books.”

“No, I can’t say that I enjoy it, certainly--but I can’t help knowing
how well it will look in the book.”

“You are mad upon your books!” said Eirene tartly. “If it was
painting, or music, or anything of that kind, I could understand it,
but mere novel-writing!”

“Of course you can’t understand it yet. Only wait until you have an
object in life, and then you will.”

“How can you say I have not an object in life? Am I not suffering for
it at this very moment?”

“You might have the politeness to say that the suffering isn’t so bad
because we are here,” suggested Zoe.

“Oh, I am not skilful in putting things politely. I am not literary!”
with deep contempt.

“And don’t you wish you were?” asked Maurice lazily.

“No, I am not like Zoe. She says that when she marries, the man must
have fallen in love with her through reading her books.”

“And none of them are written yet? Well, my future brother-in-law has
plenty of time to spare,” chuckled Maurice.

“Eirene, you are the very meanest----” began Zoe.

“Look here,” said Maurice hastily, “you’re both tired out, aren’t you?
I was sure the march was too much for you. Let us all meditate if you
think it’ll be restful. Or what do you think of turning in at once?”

“No,” said Eirene, “it is not that we are tired, it is that we are
both cross. I was cross because Zoe always seems to think that if she
has described a thing in suitable language it is all right--and
besides, she said I had no object in life. Why were you cross, Zoe?”

“I don’t know--and,” added Zoe with emphasis, “I never knew that
telling people they were cross made them less so.”

“But it’s part of Eirene’s system,” said Maurice. “Don’t you remember
how we discussed it with Wylie quite a long time ago--her view that
you ought never to mask disagreeable facts for the sake of other
people’s feelings?”

“And you were all against me!” sighed Eirene. Later on, when she and
Zoe had rolled themselves up in their rugs for the night, she recurred
to the question.

“Zoe, why were you so angry? You could hardly speak. Did I say
anything very dreadful?”

Zoe turned upon her with flashing eyes. “A girl who will tell a man
what another girl said to her in private isn’t worthy the name of
girl,” she said tersely.

“But Maurice! I never thought----”

“Maurice is a man, and men don’t understand. You seem to have had
something left out of your composition, Eirene. You ought to know that
sort of thing without thinking.”

“I suppose it is because I had no brothers and sisters and no friends
of my own rank,” said Eirene, in a choking voice. “I think I would
make almost any sacrifice for you and Maurice, and yet I do these
dreadful things without even knowing they are dreadful.”

“Oh, don’t cry!” entreated Zoe anxiously. “I suppose it isn’t your
fault, as you say. Lots of people would have an arm cut off for their
relations, though they can’t manage not to say nasty things to them.”

“I would give up everything for you and Maurice--except my object in
life,” repeated Eirene.

“How funny it would be if you found yourself called upon to give up
just that!” mused Zoe aloud, and then realised with a shock that she
was approaching dangerous ground.

“What do you mean?” asked Eirene quickly. “How could I be obliged to
give that up for you?” and Zoe embarked hastily upon a lame and
rambling explanation.

“Why, you see, it struck me suddenly that some one might make you
choose between giving up--your object, and having us killed. The sort
of thing that happens in a book, don’t you know? I don’t know what
made me think of it; I suppose it was my literary mind, which you
dislike so much. I can’t help it, I’m always like that. Whatever
happens--or even little everyday things which are not happenings at
all, simply chances for things to happen--my mind always jumps forward
to the end, and I think of all sorts of developments, and they work
themselves out on their own lines. You see, this situation is so full
of possibilities----”

“But why that one? Why do you think of such fearful things?” moaned
Eirene. Zoe, who hoped she had guided the conversation into the safe
paths of literary disquisition, was obliged to begin again.

“Oh, it was only nonsense. How could such a thing happen? Whatever
your object may be----”

“You shall judge,” said Eirene. “I will tell it you.”

“Oh, no!” cried Zoe, who was by no means anxious to find herself
officially burdened with the secret she had discovered unaided. “Why,
if there was no other reason, don’t you see that it might be safer for
Maurice and me to know nothing if we were questioned? I mean--you
don’t tell me what there is to be afraid of, but you seem to think
there’s something. Surely, as you have kept your mouth shut so long,
you had better do it still?”

“I suppose so,” agreed Eirene, with considerable hesitation. “But you
understand--you know--that whatever happens, Maurice and you are my
dear brother and sister, and nothing is to come between us?”

“If anything does, it won’t be on our side,” said Zoe heartily, and
immediately wondered whether this was likely to be strictly true.




 CHAPTER XIV.
 AN EMISSARY.

“It’s a church!” said Eirene, in tones of horror.

“Well, I suppose it was a church once, but it’s only a ruin now,” said
Zoe. Another day of climbing had brought them out of the forest, and
up to an isolated building standing on the saddle between two
mountain-peaks, which they were informed was to be their dwelling for
the present.

“But to live in it--it is sacrilege! And they say that we are to sleep
behind the _ikonostasis_!”

“Well, I think it’s rather nice of them. It has a roof, at any rate,
and the rest of the church hasn’t much.”

“But it is the sanctuary, where no woman may even set foot! Let us
tell them we refuse to enter.”

“And sleep out in the open, I suppose? No, thank you. Why, Eirene, the
brigands wouldn’t do anything that they thought would make the saints
angry, and they belong to the Greek Church just as much as you do.”

“They? They are miserable schismatics--followers of the upstart
heretical church of Thracia, outcasts from Orthodoxy!” cried Eirene.

“Oh, do be quiet!” cried Zoe anxiously. “That new man whom Milosch
brought with him to-day may understand English. I saw him staring hard
at you when you were kissing all those old worn-out saints on the
screen.”

“But what harm could it do if he did? These men know that they are
schismatics.”

“Yes, but it isn’t natural that a Scythian girl should think them so.
How will you account for your Greek sympathies?” A pause of horror, as
Zoe realised what she had said, then she rallied her forces. “You
know, the time for the ransom is getting so near now that I am feeling
horribly nervous. How dreadful it would be if any of us did anything
that made the brigands suspicious, so that they refused to let us go!
Do be sensible, and let us be thankful we have this nice little place
to ourselves.”

“Well, I shall sit outside as long as I can,” said Eirene obstinately.
“I suppose I must come in when it gets dark, but I feel we shall
deserve whatever may happen to us after this.”

Undisturbed by these religious, or superstitious, fears, Zoe went on
with the work of preparing the room, on the threshold of which Eirene
had been standing, declining to enter. It was the chancel, or apse, of
the ruined church, and the half-dome which formed its roof was still
in place, together with the _ikonostasis_, or wooden screen painted
with figures of saints, which separated it from the body of the
building, though the plates of metal which had formerly represented
haloes and details of clothing had been wrenched away. Beneath the
steps which led up to the sanctuary from the church was an underground
chamber, approached by a door and staircase on one side, and this was
the only place where a fire could be made, lest the light or smoke
should betray that the building was inhabited. The brigands were
already lighting the fire, and the smoke dispersed itself by way of
the staircase into the church, and penetrated through the cracks of
the screen into the sanctuary. It seemed curious that the wild bands
which made the place one of their haunts had not torn down the screen
for firewood, but apparently their sacrilegious impulses had stopped
short after depriving the saints of their haloes. Zoe went to work
methodically, spreading on the stone floor for beds the pine-branches
Maurice had cut, and unrolling the rugs. Maurice would sleep on the
threshold, on the broad topmost step, and Zoe felt an unusual sense of
comfort and security in the fact that this bare little room was to be
their own for some days. The end of the captivity was in sight--for
she entertained not the smallest doubt of the success of Wylie’s
efforts--and from the ruined church they might hope to make their last
journey as prisoners, to the spot where the ransom was to be paid.

 “_Well, I shall sit outside as long as I can_,” _said Eirene
 obstinately._]

Her work done, Zoe sat down to rest, too tired even to pass down the
ruined nave and seek Eirene outside. Maurice was helping some of the
brigands to cut firewood in the forest, Zeko and another man were in
charge of the underground kitchen, and the rest were mending their
moccasins or lounging idly in the church. It was not dark yet, and Zoe
had accepted Eirene’s decision as unshakable, so that it was with
surprise she saw her coming up the steps, and entering the sanctuary
without protest or hesitation. Her face was aglow with hope, and she
threw herself down on the rug beside Zoe.

“Zoe,” she whispered eagerly, “we have a friend. It is Vlasto, the man
who came to-day with Milosch.”

“But have you been talking to him all this time? Oh, Eirene, suppose
he is a spy!”

“No, listen. I was sitting outside, when he came up the hill with a
bundle of wood. He stumbled and nearly fell, and called out in
Scythian--not in the mixed language the others speak. Then he
recollected himself, and looked round to see whether any one had
heard. I thought it was curious, and spoke to him in Scythian, and he
told me Professor Panagiotis had sent him.”

“The Professor? To Maurice?”

“No, to me. He guessed which I was when he saw me venerate the
_ikons_, and the stumble and the exclamation in Scythian were meant to
draw my attention.”

“But how did the Professor know you were here?”

“I asked him that, but he did not seem to know--seemed to think that
Professor Panagiotis had been expecting me as he had you, but I told
him no. Then he said the Professor must have put two and two together
when he heard I had disappeared, but he had not told him about it.”

“I hope it’s all right,” murmured Zoe doubtfully.

“What could there be wrong about it? He said that he was to warn me of
a plan the Professor hoped to carry out--and that I should not go down
to Therma with you when we are released, lest I should be recognised
by some one belonging to the Scythian colony. But I refused to
contemplate such a thing. I said I would not be separated from my
faithful friends until we were all in safety.”

“Eirene, I don’t believe the man came from Professor Panagiotis at
all!” cried Zoe. “I can’t imagine the Professor would choose a
messenger who talked Scythian, and why should he send him to you
instead of to us?”

The question in her mind was, naturally, whether the Professor could
have changed his mind and be playing Maurice false, but to Eirene her
doubt seemed the outcome of self-esteem wounded by an apparent slight.

“I must really explain things to you, Zoe,” she said, with a
gentleness which she did not intend to be patronising. “I am Eirene
Nicolaievna Féofan, and the Professor is intrusted with the
honourable task of restoring to me the throne of my imperial
ancestors.”

“Oh dear, yes, I know that,” said Zoe impatiently; “but why should he
do such a foolish thing as to send messages about it to you now?”

“You knew?” gasped Eirene. “How?”

“Oh, the Professor had told us about you, and it came to me suddenly.
You see, you fitted in with all that I knew of Eirene Féofan, and of
nobody else.”

“Does Maurice know?”

“No, I’m sure he doesn’t, and there’s no reason why he should. Let us
keep it to ourselves.”

“I particularly wish Maurice to be told,” said Eirene decisively. “If
you won’t do it, I must.”

“Oh, I will,” cried Zoe quickly.

“Very well, then; as soon as possible, please. I am glad to put things
on a right footing at last. If I had known and trusted you as I do now
when we first met, I should have told you then, as I ought.”

“Good gracious, Eirene, don’t talk as if you were suddenly removed
miles above us! We are ourselves, and you are yourself, just as
before. I can promise you that your wonderful news won’t make any
difference to us, and I have respect enough for your character to
trust that it won’t to you.”

Eirene smiled in a puzzled way. “Perhaps you would have preferred me
to follow the Professor’s advice, and say nothing to you?” she said.

“Did he tell you to say nothing to us?”

“That was his message by Vlasto, that I was not to reveal this scheme
of his to you.”

“And you go and do it at once?”

“Professor Panagiotis has no control over my actions,” said Eirene,
with dignity. “He may tender his advice, but it is for me to accept or
reject it as I think well.”

“What could have been his reason?” mused Zoe.

“He also asked whether I had told you who I was, and entreated me to
keep the secret if I had not. It made me feel that I was not treating
you fairly--that a peasant should know what my trusted companions had
not been told.”

“Did he cross-question you any more?” asked Zoe, too anxious to care
much about Eirene’s mental perplexities.

“He was very eager to know whether all the family jewels I took with
me when I escaped were hopelessly lost. It seems that the ruby _plaque
de corsage_ was exposed for sale in Therma, and has since been
destroyed--the one with the wings, you know. That made me very sad for
a moment, but I was able to assure him that I had saved the most
important of all.”

It was dark now, but she took Zoe’s hand and guided it over her skirt.
“The girdle of the Empress Isidora,” she said, as Zoe’s fingers came
in contact with something round and hard, once, again, some dozen
times in all.

“Eirene, the weights you put in your skirt! you have had them there
all this time? That was the reason you would never let any one touch
it!” cried Zoe.

“Yes, I sewed them in that day when I made you go out for a walk at
Przlepka. Doesn’t it seem a long time ago? I dared not hide them in my
pockets. The girdle is the most precious thing in the world. It has
been handed down in secret in my father’s family since the fall of
Czarigrad.”

“But, Eirene, you had it--on you--when you told the brigands you had
given up everything, and you let Captain Wylie swear that you had? He
believed what you said.”

Eirene’s face showed perplexity. “Yes,” she said, “I know. Sometimes I
have wished that I had not done it, when I saw how you and Maurice
thought of such things. But then I remembered that I could not
possibly have let it go, so I felt that there was nothing else to be
done.”

“You are not really sorry,” said Zoe with severity. “If you were, I
suppose you would give it up to the brigands now.”

“That is quite impossible,” said Eirene calmly.

“Well, you must have a funny sort of conscience. You are afraid
something will happen to you because you have to sleep in a church,
and yet you tell a deliberate lie without a qualm.”

“We need not have slept in the church. The other could not be
avoided,” said Eirene.

“Well, I expect the something has happened already, through your
talking to Vlasto. I feel more and more certain he is a spy, and no
doubt he will manage to get the girdle from you somehow. Milosch is
quite capable of having told him what to say.”

“But how should Milosch know who I am?”

“By putting two and two together, I suppose, like the Professor. Oh,
Eirene, if you have kept us from being set free next week, I shall
never---- Well, do you think that we could ever forgive you?”

“But it would be as bad for me.”

“I don’t know--perhaps not.” Eirene looked at her in wonder. “At any
rate, you would have only yourself to blame.”

“Here is Maurice,” said Eirene. “Now remember.”

Very unwillingly Zoe obeyed her instructions, and succeeded in
catching Maurice by himself the next morning.

“Eirene is particularly anxious that I should tell you something,” she
said. “She is Eirene Féofan, the girl the Professor told us about,
our very distant cousin, and the next heir after you and me.”

Maurice sat in stupefied silence for a moment. “Did you ever?” he
remarked slowly at last. “To think that we have had her with us all
this time without finding it out!”

“I found it out long ago,” said Zoe calmly.

“No, really? How?”

“Why, of course, I had been trying to place her ever since we first
met. It was clear she came from Scythia, but I didn’t think she could
belong to the Imperial family, for how could she have got away, and
why should she be wandering about on a solitary mission? Then, one
evening, in the cave, we were talking, do you remember? and it came
out that she knew the Professor, and that she sympathised with the
Greeks against the Slavs, and that she was expecting a kingdom in her
own right. She simply couldn’t be any one but Eirene Féofan.”

“But I heard it all, and never twigged.”

“Oh, you were thinking of other things--of Eirene herself, and of
ameliorating the lot of the brigands. I nearly exploded when she
accused us of trying to find out who she was, and you declared so
indignantly that we were doing nothing of the kind. It was after I had
asked her a leading question.”

Maurice frowned. “Well, I suppose you have told her who we are?” he
said.

“Certainly not, and I am not going to.”

“Then I shall.”

“No, you won’t. It wouldn’t be safe. You know what Eirene is--or,
rather, you can’t tell what she will do. Only yesterday afternoon she
made a confidant of that new brigand, Vlasto, and told him everything
she could tell, just because he said he had been sent to her by
Professor Panagiotis.”

“That’s just it. If she knew about us, she would realise that the
Professor wouldn’t send to her. It isn’t fair, Zoe. It’s placing her
under a disadvantage for us to know her secret while she doesn’t know
ours.”

“Why, what difference would it make if she did?”

Maurice appeared to find a difficulty in answering. “Well, I should
think she’d be rather pleased,” he said, after some hesitation, “to
find that we were her equals and relations and that sort of thing,
don’t you know?”

“My dear boy!” with superb scorn. “Do you know Eirene as little as
that after all this time? Do you really think she would welcome us as
relations and equals? You seem to forget that we stand for the ruin of
all her schemes. She is simply not wanted if you are recognised as the
heir.”

“Oh, I say, but this is vile!” cried Maurice. “To go and rob a poor
girl of what she has always looked forward to as her own----! Look
here, Zoe, let’s chuck it.”

“You forget the Professor,” said Zoe.

“Oh, blow the Professor! What did he mean by mixing things up in this
way? Why couldn’t he have left Eirene alone, instead of feeding her up
with the thought that she was the heir, and then bringing her here
only to disappoint her? You don’t seem to see what a low business it
is, or how much worse it makes it that we have got to know her and
find out what it means to her.”

“I can quite see why the Professor might have brought her into contact
with us, but unfortunately he didn’t. As far as I can make out, he
dropped her father finally because he would do nothing but
shilly-shally instead of taking action, but the father was indiscreet
enough to let Eirene know about the offers that had been made him. She
takes action on her own account, in a way which would have been most
embarrassing for the poor Professor but for the railway accident. In
the meantime he has found you, and thinks no more about Eirene. But if
the train had reached Therma all right, we should probably have
separated at the station only to meet upon the Professor’s doorstep,
and he would have had to decide point-blank between his rival
candidates.”

“You seem to be enjoying the whole thing,” said Maurice indignantly.
“It doesn’t occur to you how much more it is to Eirene than to us. We
have only to go home again if the thing doesn’t come off, but it’s
everything to her. She has cut herself off entirely from her friends
and everybody in Scythia, and she has no money, and even her jewellery
is gone. What is she to do?”

“It all depends on whether you care more for Eirene’s feelings or for
what you felt to be your duty when we started,” said Zoe. “You have
heard her talk; you can imagine what sort of ruler she would make if
any possible concurrence of disasters drove the Powers in desperation
to revive the Empire for her. You know, too, the lines on which you
would work if the task fell to you. Besides, it’s not a question of
feeling, but of right.”

“I always heard that women were hard on women, but I didn’t think you
were like that.”

Zoe restrained her anger with an effort. “My dear Maurice,” she said
impatiently, “you compel me to remind you that there is one very
simple and obvious way of reconciling your rights and Eirene’s. It is
still open to you.”

“What are you suggesting?” demanded Maurice.

“I suggest nothing,” Zoe replied, with a wooden face.

“You are suggesting that I should be a cad.”

“Then I will add the further suggestion that you should not be an
idiot,” said Zoe, thoroughly roused. “I merely want you to leave
things as they are until we get to Therma. Then you can do as you
like, and I fail to see where the caddishness comes in. But if we tell
Eirene who we are now, she will simply regard us as impostors, and she
will be utterly unmanageable. I have a stake in the matter as well as
you, and I absolutely refuse to allow you to tell her. I own I do put
a little value on my life.”

“I beg your pardon. I thought you meant that I was to try and make
sure of her now, when she has no one else to turn to, and can’t get
away from us.”

“Why will men always read detestable meanings into the simplest
advice?” cried Zoe, still angry; then, softening, “Dear boy, do be
sensible. What chance do you think you would have with Eirene as
things are? Wait until she knows the truth, and can realise that it is
not quite a case of Queen Cophetua and a beggar-man. But don’t risk
all our lives, just when we are within a week of safety, by giving her
the idea that you are either an impostor or a dangerous rival. I don’t
suppose for a moment that she would mean to harm you, but she acts on
impulse, and that makes her do all sorts of things. Why--I didn’t mean
to tell you, because it seems to reflect on her--but she actually told
this man Vlasto that she has carried about with her a priceless
Byzantine girdle all this time, sewn up in pieces in her skirt.”

“But I thought she gave up everything when we were captured?” said
Maurice.

“She said she did,” said Zoe reluctantly. “We were discussing whether
she ought not to give it up to the brigands now. What do you think?”

“Oh, nonsense! It isn’t as if it belonged to the brigands,” said
Maurice contemptuously. “But,” he changed the subject with an effort,
“what about this man Vlasto? Why should he address himself to her?”

“That’s exactly what makes me think he doesn’t come from the Professor
at all,” cried Zoe. “He evidently thought the Professor knew she was
coming to Therma, and brought her a message based on that, but the
Professor had no idea of her journey, or that she was with us.”

“Did she tell you what the message was?”

“It was to try to get her to separate from us when we are ransomed--on
the plea that she might be recognised in Therma. Happily, she refused,
but---- Maurice, you know it was Milosch who brought this man here. We
thought, when we saw he was not with the band the day before
yesterday, that he had gone to meet some members of his Committee, and
get fresh orders. Suppose it was a Scythian agent he went to meet, and
that Scythia had got the idea that Eirene might be here with us, and
sent Vlasto to make sure? She has given everything away.”

“We mustn’t be seeing Scythians in every bush,” said Maurice gloomily,
“but it looks bad. What can they want to get her away from us for? It
can’t mean any good to her. Zoe, will you do your level best to keep
her firm in sticking to us? You see, she is practically an outlaw,
having cut herself off from Scythian protection, but if anything
happened to you or me the matter would be looked into.”

“I will. And you won’t make any attempt to tell her who we are?”

“No. I see that it’s better not to disturb her mind.”




 CHAPTER XV.
 THE GIRDLE OF ISIDORA.

“It’s a dog’s life!” said Zeko, leaning against one of the columns
of the deserted church, and rolling a cigarette.

“I should have thought you had rather a good time, on the whole,” said
Maurice, who was sitting on the steps below the _ikonostasis_. The
girls sat on the top step behind him, looking out through the ruined
west doorway, the lower part of which was blocked by the remains of
the narthex. Rain was falling heavily, and they could not go out, but
between the battered columns they could see the wild mountain
landscape like a picture in a frame. Most of the brigands were
luxuriating in the warmth of the underground kitchen, but the chief,
with Milosch and Vlasto, had gone out into the rain some time before,
and Zeko and one other were keeping an eye upon the prisoners.

“A good time!” repeated Zeko scornfully. “It’s hard work, and constant
danger, and no comfort, and what does it lead to? Sometimes we pull
off a good thing, as when we got hold of you, but what good will it do
us? The Committee will take nearly all the money; it isn’t as if we
could retire and settle down upon what we do get. It’s all very well
to swagger through a village with your belt full of weapons, with all
the girls pointing at you, and whispering, ‘There goes the valiant
Zeko of Stoyan’s band,’ and all the lads wanting to join you, but it’s
different when you come to the village, frozen and starving, on a
winter’s night, and want food and shelter. The people dare not refuse
you, but you can see their black looks, and you know they are cursing
you under their breath. We say we don’t rob the poor, but they know,
and we know, that our bags must be filled with bread, though the
children go hungry, and we must have greatcoats, if we take them from
the old grandfathers. Then if the Vali gets to know of our being in
the neighbourhood, and wishes to get a good name for activity with the
foreign consuls, he doesn’t go after us, but down he comes on the poor
souls who have fed us, and robs them of what we have left them. And
they don’t venture to denounce, much less betray us, for they are more
afraid of us than him.”

“But if you are so sorry for the people, why expose them to all this?”
asked Maurice.

Zeko shrugged his shoulders. “We must live,” he said. “And our own
relations are supporting other bands in our own villages in the same
way. We don’t remain in our own neighbourhood, for it would make it
too easy for the Vali. He could destroy our village if he wanted to be
revenged on us. But since we all come from different villages, and
work at long distances from our homes, he knows it would do no good to
destroy any particular village. Of course, it means that we can only
visit our own people by stealth, and with great precautions, perhaps
at intervals of many months.”

“But if the life is so hard, why go on with it?” persisted Maurice.

“What else is there to do? There are the taxes, and the troubles with
the police, and the blood-feuds--all the different reasons that made
us take to the hills; how can we go back to them? All you rich people
who grind the faces of the poor shriek loud enough when we make you
taste a little of what our life is, but you drive us to it. Perhaps
you will pity us a little now that you have tried what hunger and cold
and hardship really are.”

“I pitied you long before I came to Emathia,” said Maurice, “but I
pity you less now. Your misfortunes are so much your own fault.
United, you Emathian Christians might have wrung concessions, even
self-government, from Roum, and extorted the respect of Europe, but
you have made yourselves a byword by your dissensions. Village fights
village, and one side of a street the other side. When you should be
all banded together against the Roumis, you Illyrians and Thracians
and Dardanians are murdering Greeks, and the Greeks are preparing for
revenge. Christian hates Christian worse than Roumi.”

“Of course,” said Zeko, with entire acquiescence. “Are not the
Patriarchists--curse them to the lowest depths of hell!”--he spat on
the ground--“worse than the Roumis? If we could get rid of them we
should have no more trouble.”

“And so you waste and weaken your strength in fighting one another!”
said Maurice. “I tell you, if I were your leader, I would not trouble
about the Roumis, but I would put down with an iron hand these feuds
among Christians.”

He had spoken with more earnestness than he realised, and the brigands
laughed, while Zoe thought of the youthful Pompey in the pirate
stronghold, and Eirene frowned, not approving of this imaginary
encroachment upon her rights. Before any one had taken the trouble to
controvert Maurice’s absurd theories, the talk was interrupted. The
chief and Milosch came up the church, and Stoyan, with a lowering
brow, gripped Eirene by the shoulder.

“Is it true that you still have jewels concealed about you, though you
declared you had given up everything?” he demanded.

Eirene had turned pale, but she answered boldly, “Yes.”

“And you were aware of this?” asked the chief of Maurice.

“I did not know----” began Maurice. Then he changed the form of his
sentence. “Yes, I know.”

“Don’t hold me,” said Eirene. “I will give it up.”

“No, you are welcome to it. I hear it brings ill-luck. It has done so
already to you. Keep it, and its ill-luck with it.”

Zeko and his companion, who had begun to murmur, were appeased on
hearing this, and withdrew to discuss the matter with their comrades,
while the chief and Milosch strode out again. Zoe grasped Maurice’s
arm and drew him aside.

“Why didn’t you say you had no idea of it?” she asked indignantly.

“How could I give her away? It sounds so insane of her to have tried
to deceive even us.”

“You think only of her. Don’t you see they believe that Captain Wylie
knew, and deliberately took a false oath?”

“Oh, nonsense! how could they? But I don’t quite see what I could do
now, anyhow. They wouldn’t believe me if I explained.”

“No, you have done the mischief--you and Eirene between you,” said Zoe
bitterly. “I suppose you will both be convinced now that Vlasto was a
spy?”

No further reference was made to the matter, for Eirene, realising
what she had done, shrank painfully from any approach to it, but the
prisoners found themselves regarded with deep suspicion. They were not
allowed to move outside the church unescorted, or to enter the forest
at all, and two additional sentries, with rifles which they loaded
ostentatiously, kept guard on the sanctuary steps at night, one on
each side of Maurice. Zeko and one or two others, who had shown some
approach to friendliness, now scowled whenever their eyes fell on the
captives, and most ominous of all, Milosch went about bubbling over
with malicious and irrepressible glee. Thus a week went by, until it
was the day before that appointed for the ransom and the release. Once
more the prisoners were ordered to collect their belongings for a
march, and they obeyed with fast-beating hearts. Was freedom before
them at last?

Leaving the ruined church, they spent the morning on the rugged tracks
to which they were now becoming accustomed, climbing up and down and
winding round mountain-shoulders in a seemingly purposeless way. At
noon they sheltered in a cave, while two of the brigands went on,
apparently to spy out the land. About an hour later these men
returned, in a state of great excitement, and much talking and
discussion ensued. Finally Stoyan vouchsafed to tell the prisoners
that they would not march again until dark, and this for a
sufficiently disquieting reason. By the road they had been taking it
was necessary to pass through the district terrorised by a rival
chief, of the name of Kayo, and his band, and it had only been chosen
because it was the nearest way, and because Kayo was believed to be
busy besieging a recalcitrant Greek notable at the farther end of his
territory. But it appeared that he had become aware of the fact that
the ransom was about to be paid, and he was on the watch for Stoyan
and his band, intending either to capture the prisoners from him, and
secure the money for himself, or at least to enforce a division of the
spoil. It was necessary, therefore, to turn back and take a more
roundabout way, which would occupy at least two days more than the
other. In spite of his bitter disappointment, Maurice could not but
realise the reasonableness of Stoyan’s contention that if there was a
fight between the two bands, the girls were very likely to come off
badly, while they would not suffer from the extra journey, since he
had succeeded in procuring horses for them. Maurice suggested that
Wylie would be made very anxious by the non-appearance of his friends,
but received the assurance that a message would be despatched to him
through the country people, and that he need not pay over the ransom
until he was satisfied. The girls resigned themselves to the
inevitable, when Maurice brought them the news, with as good grace as
they could, and rested during the afternoon in preparation for the
night journey, having learnt, among other things, to utilise every
opportunity for repose that offered itself while on the march.

At dusk the two men stole out again and brought back the horses, or
rather ponies, and as soon as the girls were mounted the party set
out, proceeding at first very slowly, and with intense caution. By the
time the moon rose they were far enough from Kayo’s boundaries to be
able to move on at a good pace, though the track was so narrow, and
the precipices so steep, that the girls found it more comfortable to
shut their eyes, and leave the guidance of their steeds to the
brigands who led them. They were tired and thoroughly chilled when the
moonlight began to fail them, and welcomed the decision of Stoyan that
he could not find the way in this unfamiliar region in the dark. A
halt was called on a shelf of rock--a mere widening of the track--and
the girls lay down on their rugs on the inner side, sheltered by the
horses from the biting wind, and Maurice and the brigands on the track
itself. Hard rock and sharp stones vied with the cold in making their
resting-place uncomfortable, but they succeeded in getting a little
sleep, and were ready to go on in the morning. It was now necessary,
they were told, for them to be blindfolded again, as they were about
to pass through a passage in the mountains which the brigands were all
pledged not to show to any eyes but their own, and to this they
submitted. But when Milosch produced a cake of beeswax from his bag,
and ordered them to stop their ears as well, they rebelled.

“We spare you fright,” he asserted. “Zere is Roumi garrison in front.
If you hear ze drum, you scream, and zat betray us all. Wiz ears
obstructed, you hear nossing.”

“We shan’t scream,” declared Zoe indignantly. “We won’t make a sound,
whatever we hear.”

Milosch appealed to the chief, who pondered the matter gloomily.

“We owe you no consideration,” he grumbled. “For a whole month we have
clothed and fed you, and provided you with shelter while we lay in the
cold, and you have been deceiving us the whole time. For your sakes we
have been hunted from our usual haunts, have made forced marches, and
wandered about whole nights. You have no gratitude. If you see a
chance of betraying us to the Roumis, you will do it.”

“We are not such fools,” said Maurice. “If it came to a fight we
should be the first to suffer, as you said yesterday. We have promised
not to try to escape, and we don’t mean to.”

“What are your promises worth?” sneered Stoyan; but nothing more was
said about the wax, and the girls rode on in darkness, Maurice being
led between them. They had been marching about two hours when a sudden
tension made itself felt among the brigands. Rifles were cocked, and
there were excited whispers. The horses were turned and made to stand
across the road, with their tails to the rock, and Maurice was placed
between them and ordered to hold the bridles of both, while all the
brigands apparently went forward to reconnoitre. It was some time
before the soft pad of moccasined feet announced their return.
Milosch’s voice said, in a strident whisper, “Utter not one single
word, or ze price is death.” The bridles were taken from Maurice’s
hands, he felt a man on each side of him as before, and the march was
resumed. It was continued, still in absolute silence, for hours, until
the girls were nearly dropping from their horses with fatigue; but at
last those in front stopped, and the handkerchief was removed from
Maurice’s eyes. He stared about him in astonishment. They had halted
in a stony valley, with towering peaks all round it, and the sun was
nearing its setting. A number of men were standing round, leaning on
their rifles, but they wore rough brown clothes instead of the dirty
kilts and long leggings of Stoyan and his band. There was not a
familiar face to be seen. As if by magic, an entirely new set of
brigands had taken the place of the old.

“Do help us down, Maurice,” said Zoe, rather impatiently. “I am too
stiff to move,” and he complied mechanically. But while he fumbled
with the knot of the handkerchief which covered her eyes, he tried to
prepare her.

“Zoe--Eirene--there’s something wrong. None of our brigands are here.
These are all strangers.”

“Our brigands? How funny to call them that!” said Eirene, twisting off
the handkerchief for herself. “Oh!” and she and Zoe stared blankly at
their new companions.

“Ask them what it means, Maurice,” said Zoe, in a rather shaky voice,
and Maurice obeyed. But the strangers proved, or pretended, to be
ignorant of all the languages which their prisoners could muster among
them, though they talked to one another in an unknown tongue which
Eirene thought must be Mœsian. They declined also to understand, or
at any rate to answer, questions asked by means of signs, though when
Maurice pointed the way they had come, and signified that he and the
girls wished to go back, they quickly barred his progress, patting
their rifles meaningly. Baffled and worn out, the prisoners sat down,
whereupon the chief of the new brigands smiled upon them approvingly,
and pointed to the preparations which were being made for the night. A
pole was thrust into a crevice of the rock, and a long piece of rough
canvas hung over it and pegged down at each side to form a tent, a
second piece, fastened to the projecting end of the pole, serving as a
curtain. Maurice advised the girls to take possession, and the chief
beamed approval. A fire had been kindled, and food of some kind was
cooking in a large pot, watched eagerly by the brigands. There was the
usual deficiency of plates, but the captives were accommodated with
their share in the lid, while their guards ate out of the pot, and as,
like them, they now each possessed a wooden spoon, given them by the
women at the farm, they found no difficulty in making a meal. The fare
was a kind of hasty-pudding, made of flour boiled with grape-treacle,
very sweet and sticky, and eminently satisfying. The girls had soon
had enough, and then came the moment Maurice had been dreading. He
advised them to go to bed as soon as they had finished, but neither of
them stirred.

“Maurice, what does it mean? We must know,” said Zoe. “Has Kayo’s band
got hold of us after all?”

“How could they, without a fight? One can’t believe that Stoyan and
all his men were wiped out without a shot or a cry. No, I’m afraid it
is that Stoyan has handed us over to some other band.”

“And where are they taking us?” asked Eirene harshly.

Maurice hesitated, then decided that it was no use to attempt
concealment. “As far as I can tell, we ought to have gone south-east
to get to Therma,” he said, “but we seemed to be going south-west, in
the direction of the Morean frontier.”

“And no one will know! Perhaps we shall never be rescued,” said Zoe,
with quivering lips.

“And it is all my fault!” cried Eirene. “I have brought you into this
trouble, and I can do nothing.”

“Oh, don’t!” said Zoe hastily, forcing back her own tears when she saw
Eirene’s. “We have been in worse troubles than this, and have got
through. It’s--it’s just that everything seemed to be all right, and
now we have to begin it all over again. And we’re tired, too. We shall
look at these things more cheerfully in the morning.”

If the girls cried themselves to sleep that night, Maurice was not to
know it, and in the morning they were almost ostentatiously cheerful,
though the line of march still led away from Therma and towards the
unknown. The character of the mountains was changing. The familiar
sloping hillsides and tapering peaks were giving place to
perpendicular or even overhanging cliffs, and stupendous pillars of
rock towering in isolated masses.

“It’s like being at the bottom of a cañon,” said Zoe, late in the
afternoon, looking up at the walls of rock. “How curiously it widens
in front, Maurice! And there is another of those rock columns. Why,
there is a little house at the very top! How do they get up? No, it is
a big one--a castle.”

“It must be a rock monastery,” said Maurice, “though I didn’t know
there were any in Emathia.”

They gazed up into the sky, where the monastery of Hadgi-Antoniou
stood on its pillar like a bud at the end of a long stalk.

The day before, Wylie, with his friend Armitage, the artist, who had
insisted on being present at the release of the captives, had made his
way to the spot agreed upon, convoying the ransom, carefully packed
and carried on donkeyback. The rendezvous was a wayside inn, or _han_,
of doubtful character, providing the same accommodation for man as for
beast, and little enough for either. The brigands had stipulated that
no soldiers or armed men of any kind were to escort the treasure, and
for this reason Wylie and Armitage were obliged to come alone, even
the donkey-drivers declining the last stage, lest they should find
themselves marked men in future. Before they would embark on the
adventure at all, they had insisted that the value of their beasts,
liberally calculated, should be deposited with the British
Consul-General, and they were therefore quite at their ease in the
more attractive _han_ where they remained. Wylie had indulged in a
faint hope that he might be able to pay over the ransom at once,
receive back his friends, and carry them off the same day to these
more desirable quarters, where he had left a large collection of
clothes and other comforts, contributed by Madame Panagiotis, the
ladies at the British Consulate, and other sympathisers; but when he
suggested this to the ill-favoured landlord of the brigands’ inn, the
man only laughed at him. Did the Capitan Bey really expect the band to
be waiting to receive him, without making sure that he had kept his
word and brought no soldiers? he asked. He himself was to send word to
a point farther on in the mountains that the ransom had arrived, and
from thence notice would be sent to the brigands, who would scour the
neighbourhood before trusting themselves in the vicinity of the inn.
Wylie set his teeth doggedly. He had not sacrificed everything to
raise the ransom that it might be stolen from him now, and he and
Armitage carried in the boxes of gold with their own hands, and spread
their carpet over them. All night they relieved each other, one
sleeping above the treasure while the other, armed with sword and
revolver, kept watch.

The early part of the next day passed wearily, for they durst not
leave the boxes unguarded; but at last the innkeeper announced that
Stoyan was awaiting them at the point he had mentioned, and they
loaded the donkeys again and followed him. Stoyan and Milosch came
forward to meet them on the outskirts of a small wood, and led the way
to a clearing in the middle of it. No one else was officially present,
but Wylie was persuaded that the bushes had eyes, and that
rifle-barrels protruded through the underwood. The boxes were lifted
down, the gold counted and tested, and the chief announced that he was
satisfied.

“Then where are our friends?” asked Wylie.

“They are already released,” was the answer.

“But why? I thought they were to be given up to us here?”

“Ah, we know the Capitan of old, that he baits traps for us,” smiled
Stoyan. “If he had his friends safe, what should prevent him from
calling forward soldiers to seize us before we could escape with the
gold? Therefore he will not meet his friends while he is in our
district. They are already on the way to Therma, and he can catch them
up.”

“But why release them before the ransom was paid?”

“It was promised, and we know that an Englishman always keeps his
word. It is so, is it not? An Englishman’s word is never broken?”

“Never. But who is with them?” asked Wylie, puzzled and uneasy, he
knew not why.

“None of us. We despatched them alone, the two women riding on horses.
Hasten after them, lest some other harm befall them. See!” He
whistled, and brigands rose out of every bush, like the clansmen of
Roderick Dhu. “We are all here. The Capitan can count the whole band.”

Wylie counted, and found none absent, and he and Armitage withdrew,
awkwardly enough. As they reached the inn, a peasant who was talking
to the landlord turned and looked at them.

“You are the person for whom I had a message,” he said. “I met a man
and two women riding towards Therma, and they bade me watch for a
European gentleman with blue eyes, and tell him that they would reach
the city first.”

Wylie flung the man a coin, and shouting to Armitage to pay the
reckoning, rushed indoors to fetch their belongings. These were soon
piled upon the donkeys, and they set out, Wylie keeping the cavalcade
moving at a smart pace, for the desire to see his friends again was
heightened by the anxiety inspired by Stoyan’s words. As they hurried
on, a voice hailed them suddenly from the mountain-side, and, looking
up, they saw Milosch standing on a jutting crag.

“When you not find zat you seek,” he cried, “remember ze perjured
oass!”

“What in the world is a perjured oass?” said Armitage. “Does he mean
oaf?” with vague reminiscences of Kipling.

“From what I know of the gentleman, I should say he meant a broken
oath,” said Wylie. “But I don’t know of any broken oath, unless
they’ve broken theirs. Come on.”




 CHAPTER XVI.
 HAGIOS ANTONIOS.

The monastery of Hadgi-Antoniou towered aloft on its rocky pillar,
and the prisoners and their guards stood below looking up at it, for
there was no apparent means of reaching the top. Here and there
ladders were visible on the face of the rock, but they ceased in the
most capricious way at the points of greatest danger, and the lowest
was something like a hundred and fifty feet above the ground. But the
brigands did not share the perplexity of their captives, and two or
three of them fired off their rifles. This was evidently the
recognised way of attracting the attention of the inhabitants, for two
heads, with long beards and high square caps, appeared far above
against the sky, and a few words were exchanged, after which a rope,
with something fastened to the end, seemed to come crawling down the
rock from a projecting tower.

“Oh, Maurice, what is going to happen?” whispered Zoe, gazing
fascinated at the slowly moving rope.

“I suppose they will draw us up one by one,” he answered.

“One by one? Then we shall be separated,” said Eirene fearfully.

“I hope not, but in any case, let us make a compact together that none
of us will come to any decision, or enter into any promise, without
the other two. If they try to work upon us separately, let us each
demand to be confronted with the others. It’s our only chance.”

The girls promised hastily, eyeing the parcel at the end of the rope,
which had now reached the ground, and revealed itself as a large net,
attached by its four corners to a stout hook. The brigands unhooked
the corners, and laying the net flat, made signs to the prisoners.

“Have we to go up in that?” said Zoe, turning white.

“I had better go first,” said Maurice. “Then you’ll see what it’s
like.”

Eirene uttered an inarticulate protest, but he sat down on the net,
the corners were gathered together and hooked above his head, and he
was slowly raised from the ground. The girls watched the ascent with
panting breath and a sick feeling of horror, for the rope moved
jerkily, and at each jerk the net swung backwards and forwards, now
sending Maurice against the rock, from which he was obliged to ward
himself off with his hands, and now out into mid-air. It seemed to
them that they had given him up for lost a hundred times before the
net was grasped by sturdy hands and hauled into the tower, and they
discovered that they were standing with their arms round one another,
locked in a tight grip. A voice shouted something from the tower as
the rope began to descend again, and almost before they had realised
that one of them must make the journey next, the brigand chief was
spreading out the net, and indicating that they might go up together.
But Maurice’s voice called from above, “Not both at once. The rope
isn’t strong enough,” and Zoe pushed Eirene forward. “You next,” she
said, and immediately, after her usual fashion, began to wonder
whether she had really chosen the harder part for herself in watching
a second ascent, or had merely deprived Eirene of the encouragement of
example.

Eirene’s journey was much less exciting than Maurice’s, and Zoe
guessed that her brother was exercising a guiding influence on the
rope, for the terrifying oscillations had almost ceased. Be that as it
might, the ascent was sufficiently awful, and Zoe wished vigorously
that she had not possessed such good sight. Looking resolutely
upwards, when it was her turn to be enclosed in the net, she saw, with
a thrill of horror, that the rope, which cut the clear sky like a
black line, was old and frayed, reduced in some places, as she
persuaded herself, almost to a single strand. Looking down gave her no
comfort, for the ground seemed immeasurably distant, and the swinging
motion, slight as it now was, made her giddy, so that at last she shut
her eyes, and kept them closed until she felt herself seized and
dragged roughly sideways, then deposited upon some sort of floor, and
the net unhooked.

“Come, Zoe, it’s safely over, and you’re all right,” said Maurice, as
she sat trembling in every limb and unable to move. “They want to send
the net down for our things.”

“The rope, Maurice--it’s breaking!” she managed to articulate,
grasping his arm to help herself up.

“Oh, you noticed that, did you? That was why I wouldn’t let you come
up together. But one of the monks who speaks Thracian says that they
often draw up two men at once, and nothing has ever happened yet. The
rope is only in its fourth year now, and it’s due to last for six.”

“I hope I shan’t have to go up by it in its sixth year,” said Zoe,
forcing a smile. “Where’s Eirene?”

“In a state of collapse inside somewhere, being looked after by the
grandmother of all old women. Pull yourself together, Zoe. I think she
wants you. And we might as well get out of the way of these reverend
gentlemen.”

There was little room in the tower for anything but the rude capstan
or windlass which worked the rope and the monks who pushed at its
bars, and Zoe tottered out with the help of Maurice’s arm, to find
herself in a stone-paved court, with Eirene lying on the stones in a
dead faint, and an old woman wailing over her, while a group of monks
wavered at a discreet distance, alternately drawn by curiosity and
withheld by the consciousness that they ought not to be present.

“I say, what’s this?” cried Maurice. “She wasn’t fainting just
now--only rather shaky. Look here, Zoe, can’t you do anything? What’s
the proper thing--brandy?”

“Water,” answered Zoe reprovingly, and Maurice shouted for water in
English, Latin, Greek, French, and Thracian. It was the French that
proved effectual at last, for one of the monks understood sufficiently
to summon another old woman with a water-jar.

“Oh, Zoe, you are here!” gasped Eirene, when she opened her eyes.
“Stay with me. Don’t let them take me away. I won’t be separated from
you and Maurice.”

The French-speaking monk approached Maurice softly. “Pray reassure her
Royal Highness,” he entreated. “We have prepared for her the best
accommodation in our power, and if she desires to be attended by the
other young woman, there is no difficulty. She is to enjoy every
indulgence suited to her rank, if it is not inconsistent with her
safety.”

Much puzzled, Maurice conveyed the desired assurance to Eirene, who
took in its significance at once, and inquired sharply how he was to
be treated, in reply to which the monk declared that he would be the
guest of the monastery. Satisfied with this answer, Eirene asked to be
shown her room, to which she and Zoe were conducted by one of the
officials of the monastery and the two old women. It was a large, low
chamber, opening from a corridor, with a stone floor, and stone divans
all round it, above which was a decoration of light arcading in
plaster. There was a large fireplace projecting into the room, with a
hearth piled with logs, and three windows, all innocent of glass, but
provided with shutters. From two of these windows views of the
surrounding country far below could be obtained; the other looked out
on a smaller courtyard and across to another of the curiously
irregular buildings which occupied the summit of the rock, and from a
window in this the girls presently saw Maurice looking out. It was too
far to talk, but he signalled to them that he was all right, and they
returned into the room, much comforted, to find that the old women had
lighted the fire and spread a carpet on the divan near it. Presently
they brought in a tray of savoury food, the nature of which was not
evident, save that it contained no meat, and set it on a stool close
to the divan, when the girls were thankful to partake of it. Too tired
even for surmises, they went to bed immediately afterwards, sleeping
so soundly on their hard couch that even the thunder of a mallet on a
board, which summoned the monks to service at midnight, failed to wake
them.

They slept far into the next day, and it was late in the afternoon
when they looked out into the courtyard, to see Maurice, in full Greek
costume, wandering disconsolately about, and gazing up at their
window. They wondered that he had made no attempt to reach them, but
another glance showed one of the old women sitting like Cerberus at
the foot of the steps leading to their corridor, with the evident
purpose of preventing any intrusion.

“Oh, Maurice, how nice and respectable you look!” cried Zoe. “That
kilt suits you beautifully.”

“It doesn’t,” said Eirene indignantly. “He looks as if he was going to
a masked--no, a fancy ball. He ought always to wear English country
clothes.”

“And go to the opera in them, like the proverbial British tourist, I
suppose?” said Zoe. “But why didn’t you get some clothes for us,
Maurice, if they let you go out shopping?”

“They don’t, but there’s a Greek village somewhere near, and the old
monk who looks after me--who is second in command, or prior, or
something--got me these things through a _kosmikos_, who seems to be a
sort of lay-brother. But the women’s dress round here seems to be
distinctly advanced--rather markedly rational, in fact--and I didn’t
think you’d care to wear it.”

“Oh, well, tell them to send us two blouses and some stuff, and we’ll
make skirts for ourselves--and scissors and needles and cotton, of
course--and some hairpins. But how are we to pay?”

“With promises, I suppose. The people seem to share Stoyan’s touching
faith in an Englishman’s word--which is rather rudely shaken in his
case now, unfortunately. I told the monk I’d pay when we got back to
civilisation.”

“But why are we here at all?” asked Eirene.

“That they either can’t or won’t tell me. It has something to do with
one of the Committees, evidently--trust them to have a finger in the
pie--but I can’t make out how long we are to be kept here, or whether
anything is to happen or not. The monks are not half bad old fellows.
The Hegoumenos--that’s the abbot--has been trotting me round this
morning to show me the church and the library and all the chapels, and
at dinner last night he was full of the most infantile questions. Of
course, he had to ask them all through Papa Athanasios, who is my
particular monk, and what with his French and mine, the abbot must
have amassed some wonderful information.”

“It’s all very well their being nice, but will they let us out?” broke
in Zoe.

“Certainly not at present, but I shall work at them patiently. I
haven’t quite got at the state of affairs yet, but there seem to be
two parties among the monks, and one of them may be more pliable than
the other.”

“And are they going to keep us shut up in this room?”

“Why, you see, you really have no business here at all. Thanks to
Eirene’s greatness, you are in the quarters reserved for lady pilgrims
of the very highest rank, but you can’t be let out while the monks are
about, lest you should distract their minds. I believe that when they
are safely in church you will be allowed to walk about outside, and
then you will have to spend part of your time in sitting under my
window and talking to me, for I shall be locked up. The idea is that
if we were all free at once, we might escape, you see. But there are
little bits of garden mixed up with the buildings, where you may walk,
only you must take care not to go too near the edge of the rock, for
there’s no protection whatever. And of course your wardress, or
duenna, or whatever her capacity is, will chaperon you everywhere.
Isn’t she a caution? I spent ever so long trying to get her to go up
and ask you if I mightn’t come and call, and her only answer to my
blandishments was to threaten to brain me with her keys. Ah, there
goes the _semantron_--the wooden gong thing that calls the monks to
church. I’ll retire gracefully to my cell, and you will profit by my
self-effacement.”

The exterior of the buildings of Hadgi-Antoniou became well and
wearily known to the two girls during the days that followed, as they
paced from courtyard to garden-patch and back again, to the
accompaniment of the lusty shouts from the church which marked the
monks’ responses to the service. The regularity noticeable in western
monastic edifices was here conspicuous by its absence, for though the
church, the refectory, and the two blocks of rooms devoted to visitors
might be conceived to have been intended to occupy the sides of a
square, all symmetry had been destroyed by the crowd of smaller
chapels, and of cottages occupied by the monks, which seemed to have
been dropped down anywhere and at every angle. There was no encircling
wall, which the impregnable position of the monastery rendered
unnecessary, and though here and there a tower, or the end of a
building, reached the very edge of the plateau, its fringes were
generally occupied by uninteresting pieces of garden, in which the
girls would sit, looking at the cloudy mountains to the north, or the
dim country to the south, until their gaoler would rattle her keys to
intimate that the service was nearing its end, and they must return to
the custody of their room. Once they stood in the narthex, or porch,
of the church, which was decorated in fresco with lively
representations of the Torments of the Lost, and with infinite
precaution, peeped in, to see the monks at worship, leaning on their
crutched staves, and shouting incessant responses, while the metalled
and jewelled figures on the _ikonostasis_ made a blaze of light and
colour in the prevailing dimness.

Permission to see Maurice any nearer than the courtyard was still
rigorously refused, but he spent most of his free time under their
window; and when the difficulties of cutting out with a hopeless pair
of scissors had been overcome, Zoe, congratulating herself on her
diplomacy, announced that the need of clothes was too urgent to allow
of his being entertained by more than one at a time. Accordingly, she
sat working at one of the farther windows while Eirene talked to
Maurice at that looking into the courtyard, but she would have found
it difficult to formulate definite reasons for her altruism. A vague
feeling that the more closely Eirene’s interests were linked with
theirs, the more hope there would be of a satisfactory compromise in
the future, was perhaps her strongest impression. But one afternoon
Eirene called to her excitedly to come, since Maurice had news. Zoe
flew to her side.

“No, no, not news from outside,” said Maurice quickly. “Why did you
put it like that, Eirene? It’s only that I have found out what’s wrong
among the monks here. It seems that there are two parties, a Greek and
a Thracian party, as in Emathia generally. The Greeks are in
possession, of course, and the Hegoumenos is a Greek, but the other
lot are pretty strong, and have been gradually ousting the Greeks from
the minor offices of the community. Their idea is to carry the
monastery over to the Exarchist side--what you and Professor
Panagiotis call the schismatics, Eirene--and Scythia is giving them a
helping hand. The poor old Hegoumenos has only one idea--to keep
matters from coming to a crisis; for though he knows the few he can
trust, and the ringleaders on the other side, he doesn’t know how the
main body of the monks would vote, but he fears the worst. It seems to
have been a Scythian emissary who arranged for our being brought here,
on the pretext that Eirene’s life was in danger outside. At least,
that was what they told him, but I should say that the Thracian party
knew something more. At any rate, I have some hope of getting him to
let us go if we are left alone long enough. I’m on the track of the
dodge by which they let the ladders down so as to make a way to the
ground, with a rope-ladder at the bottom, and if they would leave us
unguarded one night we might get down by that, for we could never work
the capstan without half the monks to help. Then we might hide in the
village till we could get a message through to Wylie.”

“But why not send the message at once?” cried Zoe.

Maurice held up empty hands. “Unfortunately, we can only pay in
promises,” he said.

“But can’t you get the Hegoumenos to let us go?”

“He daren’t. Only a definite order from the Patriarch would give him
courage to override the opposition of the Thracian monks, and that
would probably mean the loss of the monastery for the Greeks. No, our
only hope is a little calculated carelessness one night, and that I
trust we may be able to arrange.”

But the very next day Maurice appeared with a long face. “I’m afraid
it’s all up,” he said. “I wouldn’t have told you, only I thought you
ought to be prepared. There’s some Scythian official coming here, and
he’s due to-night.”

“It mayn’t be about us,” suggested Zoe, without conviction.

“It is. He’s coming to ascertain Eirene’s wishes, so the Hegoumenos
told me--for the purpose of frustrating them, I should imagine.”

“Oh, what can Captain Wylie be doing?” cried Zoe.

“Why, how could he possibly know where we are? Who would think of
looking for us here? If he paid the ransom----”

“But I thought the brigands were honest in a way. Would they take the
ransom without giving us up?”

“Ah, Stoyan thought he had a grievance against us, you see----”
Maurice broke off suddenly. “I only hope he gave poor old Wylie a
safe-conduct. We know that if he’s all right he’ll be moving heaven
and earth to find us.”

“Maurice,” cried Eirene eagerly, “if I gave you the girdle of Isidora
now, would there be time? Could you bribe them to let us go before
this man comes?”

Maurice shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s too late,” he said. “Money
might do it, but a thing like that would be clear evidence that they
had been bribed, and the Hegoumenos would suffer. After all, you can’t
wonder that when the whole future of the monastery is at stake, he
should think more of it than of us.”

“Well,” said Zoe, with aggressive cheerfulness, “I am going to finish
my work. I won’t face a presumably civilised man--even if he is only a
Tartar underneath--in a skirt like a _vivandière’s_. You had better
do yours too, instead of going out this morning, Eirene. There’s the
_semantron_, Maurice. Retire to your cell.”

“How can you be so flippant?” said Eirene indignantly, taking up her
work with languid fingers.

“If I wasn’t, I should cry, which would be both useless and
disgraceful. We seem fated to fall back again every time we think our
troubles are at an end.”

“I suppose you hate me?” said Eirene.

“Oh no, I don’t. We’re all in the same boat, for one thing, and you
didn’t mean to do all the things you have done, you know. It was
Eirene-ism, not deliberate wickedness.”

“I think you are the most absolutely heartless person I ever met!”
cried Eirene, with flashing eyes.

“Very well. I’m sure it’s better to be heartless in our present
circumstances. It will save us loads of misery.”

They worked in silent mutual indignation for some little time, and
then Eirene spoke suddenly, with an obvious effort.

“I have a plan,” she said. “I think I see how to put things right.”

“Then please forget it. It was your last bright idea that got us into
this fix, you know.”

“I know it was, and I will atone for it. When this Scythian comes, I
will announce boldly who I am, and promise to submit in future. Of
course they think that you and Maurice were concerned in my escape;
but I will assure them that you had nothing to do with it--that I
merely seized on you to help me, and that you had no idea who I was
until it was impossible for you to do anything. They would make you
promise to keep all that had happened a secret, no doubt, but I think
they would let you go, and take me back to Scythia. Shouldn’t you be a
little sorry for me, Zoe? We have been so much together--and it would
mean that I had given up my mission. You asked me if I would do even
that for you and Maurice, you know, and now I am going to do it. We
shall never see each other again. If they were to forgive me, I
suppose you might possibly hear that I was married to somebody, but if
not, you would never hear of me any more.”

“Oh, don’t be tragic!” said Zoe, the more impatiently that she was
feeling rather ashamed of herself. “How can you go on in this way?”

“But it is tragedy. Why won’t you understand, Zoe, that there are some
things in life that can’t be put right by making an epigram, and then
thinking of something else? Some day you will know, perhaps. Have you
ever heard of the Black Nuns?”

“No, I didn’t know there were any nuns in Scythia.”

“There are many, and the Black Nuns are particularly useful in taking
charge of people who won’t do what they are told, or who have
committed indiscretions--people of high rank, I mean. I committed an
indiscretion in running away. The disobedient girls return to the
world obedient. The indiscreet ones die, sooner or later, and there is
a grand funeral. A grand funeral can’t hurt any one, can it? And it
shows that the relatives have nothing to conceal.”

“Oh, do stop!” cried Zoe. “You are letting things get upon your mind.
I’m sorry I said that about your having got us into this scrape; I was
a beast to do it. Let us talk about something else.”

“I think I could do it--I am almost sure I could--if it saved you--and
Maurice,” pursued Eirene, lingering over Maurice’s name with the
tenderness that spoke volumes to Maurice’s sister. “But it’s no use
pretending that I don’t know what it would mean, or that I should like
it.”

“Oh, do try and have a little sense!” entreated Zoe. “Can you imagine
for a moment that Maurice--or any real man--would let a girl sacrifice
herself to save him? I don’t know what kind of creatures you can have
known, Eirene; you have such hopeless ideas. You may be quite sure
that Maurice would never go away into safety and leave you to be
unkindly treated.”

“He might not have the choice. I should be carried off secretly. But
you and Maurice will think of me sometimes, and talk about me----”

“And come and shed tears on your grave, I suppose? Eirene, will you
have the goodness not to be sentimental? If you were carried off to
Scythia, Maurice and I would go after you and rescue you. I would
pretend to be you and remain in your place, while Maurice got you
away, and then I should appeal to the British Ambassador and get
rescued myself.”




 CHAPTER XVII.
 UNMASKED.

In spite of her optimistic view of the situation, Zoe passed a
disturbed night, which the shouts and the persistent creaking of the
windlass announcing the arrival of the Scythian emissary did not tend
to soothe. She was oppressed by the conviction that she ought to
confide in Eirene, while at the same time she was resolved to do
nothing of the kind. It was unfair, she owned, to receive her
confidence and give her none in return, but the risks were too great.
Eirene might welcome the disclosure, since it would bridge the
infinite gulf she must believe to exist between herself and Maurice,
but it might make her all the more determined to sacrifice herself, if
she realised how important it was that he should not remain in
Scythian hands. And, on the other hand, she might refuse to believe
it, and in her pique insist on acting alone, when common action on the
part of the three was indispensable. Impatiently Zoe wished that it
had been possible to predict what Eirene would do in any given
circumstances. It was the uncertainty that made her so difficult to
deal with, and Zoe almost regretted that she had not done as Maurice
advised, and told her earlier, since things could not well have fallen
out worse than they had done. At last, as she tossed and turned on the
unyielding divan, she decided on a compromise. She would not tell
Eirene before the interview with the Scythian official, lest she
should do anything rash, but as soon as they had some idea what was to
happen she would make the disclosure.

The Scythian was evidently not inclined to waste time, for the girls
had only just breakfasted when a large and imposing letter was brought
in by the old woman. In it M. Boris Constantinovitch Kirileff did
himself the honour to recall himself to her Royal Highness’s
recollection, and craved humbly permission to wait upon her, either in
her own apartments or in the guest-room of the monastery.

“Now comes the tug of war!” said Eirene. “We don’t want him up here,
do we, Zoe? We will see him in the guest-room, then. I remember him at
Pavelsburg. He is in the Imperial Chancellery.”

The old woman had brought a pen and ink, but the only paper available
was the back of M. Kirileff’s beautiful un-folded epistle, on which
the answer was duly written by Zoe. When it had been despatched, she
and Eirene looked at one another rather anxiously. It was undeniable
that their appearance was not distinguished. A badly fitting blouse, a
home-made skirt, moccasins instead of shoes, and a paucity of
hairpins--for none had been obtainable in the village--are drawbacks
which only beauty of a very exceptional order can successfully
surmount.

“I shouldn’t mind a bit, if it wasn’t that we want to look so
particularly dignified,” said Zoe. “Suppose you put on the famous
girdle, Eirene. That ought to make an impression.”

“Hasn’t it brought us enough bad luck already?” asked Eirene, with a
shudder. “No, it shall stay where it is.”

“Look here, Eirene; don’t do anything rash,” Zoe entreated her. “This
man may merely have orders to escort you to Therma, so don’t begin by
making a tragic submission.”

“I assure you I shall be altogether the Princess in my dealings with
M. Kirileff,” returned Eirene, as the old woman appeared on the
threshold and beckoned to them. “I shall resort to brag.”

“You mean bluff,” said Zoe, in a stage whisper, as they descended the
stairs. “Shall we see Maurice, I wonder?”

There was no sign of Maurice in the courtyard, but when they mounted
the steps to the guest-room they caught sight of him among a number of
monks, who were gathered round him as though responsible for his
safe-keeping. But they had no time to ask one another what this meant,
for a well-preserved man of uncertain age, in immaculate morning
dress, advanced with every demonstration of respectful delight, and
touched Eirene’s hand with a highly waxed moustache. She had meant to
present him to Zoe, but as though he had divined her intention, he led
her immediately up the room to the divan on which the old Hegoumenos
was seated, a picture of puzzled, anxious willingness to oblige. He
indicated to Eirene the place next him, and M. Kirileff, on her
invitation, also seated himself, but at a respectful distance. Zoe’s
eyes met Maurice’s with keen amusement.

“You are the bearer of some message for me, I suppose?” said Eirene to
the Scythian. He bowed profoundly.

“On the contrary, madame, I have only an apology--an apology on my own
account for the measures taken on your behalf. I know how presumptuous
and uncalled for they must appear, and nothing but the conviction that
they have secured your safety at a moment of imminent danger could
give me courage to appear in your presence.”

“Then I am to attribute my being brought here to your influence?” said
Eirene, with the slightest possible lifting of the eyebrows. “I
confess, monsieur, my own impression would be that you had left me to
pass unaided through a month of incessant danger, and only interposed
to destroy my hopes when I was upon the very verge of safety.”

“Madame, the greatness of your mind will quickly set my conduct in the
true light. As a man of honour and the faithful servant of my august
master, whose affection for your illustrious house needs no assurances
from me, I humbly assure you that at the moment you supposed yourself
on the verge of safety you were in more frightful peril than during
the whole month with the brigands.”

“You astonish me, monsieur. From whom was this danger to arise?”

“It was not a matter of the future, madame; it existed already--in
your very _entourage_. Has your Royal Highness any knowledge of the
true character of the young man and woman who shared your captivity?”

“A month in their company in such circumstances ought to be
conclusive, monsieur. I have the pleasure to be able to assure you
that they have both displayed a fidelity which would be praiseworthy
in dependants of my own, but which must be unique in the case of
strangers united to me only by the bond of a common disaster.”

“You call them strangers, madame. I am to understand they were unknown
to you at the time you undertook your--pilgrimage?”

“At the time I undertook my--pilgrimage,” replied Eirene, with an
intonation which brought an involuntary smile to Zoe’s lips, “I was as
absolutely ignorant of the existence of Mr and Miss Smith as they were
of my identity when chance threw us together on our journey.”

“Chance? Ah, yes, the meeting was casual on your part, no doubt,
madame. But the ignorance of the brother and sister Smith exists only
in your mind, so guileless, so unsuspicious of treachery.”

“I assure you, monsieur, I am by no means unsuspicious by nature,”
said Eirene, with distinct resentment. “So determined was I to
preserve my _incognito_ that I communicated the route and object of
my--pilgrimage to no one but the lady who attended me, and who is
since dead. It was impossible for any one else to be acquainted with
it.”

Zoe waited eagerly for the answer. The artistic way in which M.
Kirileff was leading up to his _dénouement_ appealed to her critical
faculty. From a purely literary point of view she could have applauded
the unblushing lie with which he countered Eirene’s declaration.

“Ah, madame, these things leak out somehow. If we were acquainted with
your intention--I speak of the office I have the honour to
represent--and were watching over your safety without your knowledge,
if it was known also to the plotter Panagiotis, why should it be
unknown to these tools of his?”

“If you were watching over my safety, monsieur, I can only say that
your measures left something to be desired,” said Eirene smartly. “I
will remind you that you have just applied a very offensive term to a
lady and gentleman whom the events of the past month have taught me to
hold in the highest esteem.”

“I could wish, madame, that they had betrayed themselves in their true
colours, since that would have released me from the sad duty of
acquainting you with their worthlessness. They are the creatures of
the arch-conspirator Panagiotis in an attempt to deprive you of the
rights bequeathed to you by your imperial ancestors.”

“Monsieur, you speak in riddles. The thing is too absurd.”

“Precisely, madame. It is too absurd. But if you ask this man, this
woman”--he pointed an accusing finger at Maurice, who was laboriously
endeavouring to follow the rapidly spoken French, and succeeding at
intervals, and at the deeply interested Zoe--“who they really are,
they will assure you that their true name is not Smith, but Teffany,
and that they are descended from Basil, the elder brother of your
ancestor Leo, son of the Emperor John Theophanis.”

“But this is preposterous!” cried Eirene.

“Madame, you have chosen the only word that fits the situation. It is
preposterous. They were brought up by their grandfather, a respectable
landed proprietor named Smith, who became possessed, late in life,
with the delusion that he was a descendant of the last Christian
Emperor. The delusion would, no doubt, have died with him, but,
unfortunately, it came to the ears of the firebrand Panagiotis in one
of his visits to England for the purpose of stirring up support for
his incendiary propaganda. He had been repulsed by your illustrious
father, who preferred to await in dignified passivity the results of
the diplomacy of his august friend the Emperor of Scythia, rather than
put himself forward as the figurehead of a revolutionary conspiracy.
Thus deprived of a _raison d’être_ for his schemes, this man
Panagiotis finds himself confronted with the means at once of
forwarding his plots and of revenging himself upon your father’s
daughter. He will produce a nearer heir. Now, madame, mark the course
of events. Your impetuous resolution to proceed on pilgrimage to the
shrines most nearly associated with the devotion of your illustrious
race has the effect of bringing you within the range of the
conspiracy, which has been so deftly engineered that even we, who are
secretly protecting your movements, are unacquainted with its full
purpose. The fiend Panagiotis sees his opportunity, and instructs his
tools to worm themselves by insidious means into your confidence----”

“You are mistaken, monsieur,” with a last effort of dignity. “It was I
who addressed myself to Miss Smith.”

“Alas, madame! must I point out that this apparent reserve was but a
means of piquing the curiosity of a young lady who had just
emancipated herself from the safeguards of her rank, and might be
supposed to possess an innocent curiosity as to the concerns of her
_bourgeois_ fellow-travellers?” Eirene grew scarlet, and Zoe,
remembering their early acquaintance, could not repress a smile. “The
ruse was successful. By the time the Roumi frontier was crossed, the
conspirators, with a confederate who poses as an officer of the
British Army, were in possession of your Royal Highness’s confidence.
I tell you frankly, with a full sense of the seriousness of my words,
that but for the accident to the bridge, which I cannot help regarding
as providential--I am no atheist, thank the saints!--I do not know
what the result would have been. Whether you would ever have been
permitted to reach Therma I cannot tell. It was the apparently
commonplace and innocuous character of your companions that baffled
all suspicion, and I doubt if our agents would have penetrated their
true nature in time. But if you had once reached Therma, and accepted
the treacherous hospitality of Panagiotis at his country villa, there
can be no doubt that you would never have left it alive and free. You
were an obstacle to his plans. Only your death, or your acceptance of
an alternative, too degrading to you as a Princess and a woman for me
to do more than hint at it, would have made his schemes safe.”

“Zoe,” broke in Maurice, as Eirene changed colour again when her eyes,
vainly seeking a resting-place, met his, “what is this blackguard
saying? Tell him to talk English, or if he can’t, to let you
interpret. I can’t understand what he says, but he is making Eirene
miserable.”

“He says that we are impostors, and that we made up to her on the
journey that we might decoy her to the Professor’s and kill her,” said
Zoe succinctly.

“Rubbish!” said Maurice. “Eirene, how can you listen to such nonsense?
You know us too well to believe it, I should hope. Zoe and I will
explain the whole thing to you in five minutes, if you will see us
somewhere without this man, who seems to be mixing himself up in
things which don’t concern him in the least.”

“I do not speak English,” observed M. Kirileff mildly, and--so Zoe
averred afterwards--untruthfully, “but it appears to me that this
young man is presuming upon the confidence with which you have
honoured him, madame. He has to learn that you are no longer
unprotected, but that the shield of Scythia is interposed between your
royal person and his presumptuous designs. I cannot sufficiently
admire the way in which Providence has utilised the atrocious crime of
the brigands to preserve you from actual danger to your life and
peace. The impostor durst not announce himself in his pretended
character, knowing the devotion of the miscreants--however
misdirected--to the Slavic and Exarchist idea, and the necessity of
retaining your confidence forced him to treat you with respect and
reserve. It was when the ransom was paid, and you were once more at
his mercy, that you would have been again in extreme danger. That
danger I had the happiness to avert by bringing you here. My measures
were hasty, even violent, I confess--I had no choice--but they were
successful.”

“Your fidelity calls for my highest gratitude, monsieur,” said Eirene,
rallying her forces. “I do not mind confessing that I am overwhelmed
by the news you have brought me. Such treachery--such duplicity--where
I saw only loyalty and respect, is almost incredible. This impudent
assertion, which touches my rights--what course is to be taken
respecting it?”

“In my opinion, madame--which is not without weight, if I may
respectfully say so, with my superiors--there could be no more
suitable place for the detention of the culprits than this. It is the
most humane, as well as the most convenient, view of the case to
regard them as suffering from hereditary mania, but they cannot be
allowed to impose their wild hallucinations upon the world. We must
have from each of them a definite confession of the imposture, and of
the steps by which they were induced to acquiesce in it, as well as of
their motives in forcing themselves upon you. Until that confession is
signed, they may well remain here in safety, carefully looked after by
the good monks, and causing scandal to no one.”

“The idea is excellent,” said Eirene. “Tell me,” she added harshly,
turning to Maurice, “are you willing to sign a confession of the
imposture of which you have been guilty, and to entreat my pardon for
your treachery?”

“I’m not going to sign anything that isn’t true,” returned Maurice. “I
don’t carry all my family papers about with me, but I have them safe
at home. It’s as certain that we are descended from the elder son of
John Theophanis as that you are from the younger.”

Eirene raised her head disdainfully. “The comparison shows your state
of mind,” she said. “You are undoubtedly labouring under a delusion,
and it is only charity to see that you are kept in safety until it has
passed away.”

“Oh, very well. Tell the first British Consul you come across your
idea of charity, and see what he will say.”

“The British Consul would do nothing,” she said sharply. “You seem to
forget that by alleging a Greek descent you have deliberately
renounced your British citizenship, and placed yourself among my
subjects--mine.”

“I am sorry to appear to contradict you, but when you come to think of
it, isn’t it just the other way about?”

“Oh, this is too much!” cried Eirene, rising from her seat. “Am I to
endure these insults--to be defied to my very face? And this from one
whom I trusted!”

“Calm yourself, madame,” said M. Kirileff, seizing the opportunity to
point a judicious moral. “All your friends must regret that your
impatience of restraint, your love of the bizarre, led you into such a
situation, but you will not be left to cope with it alone. My
instructions are to inquire your wishes for the future?”

“Oh, to go anywhere, away from here!” She sank upon the divan again.

“I fear”--M. Kirileff’s tone was slightly severe--“that your Royal
Highness can hardly expect to be received at Court as before, at any
rate until your reputation for--shall I say eccentricity of
behaviour?--has been in some degree forgotten. You would not care to
remain here?”

“Here?” Eirene shuddered. “I detest every stone of the place. No,
monsieur, I must be in a town. My health, my nerves, have suffered
cruelly from the miseries of the past month, and from this crowning
trial. I need medical care, female attendance.”

“I can well understand your feelings, madame. As I came here, Madame
Ladoguin, the wife of our Consul-General at Therma, begged me to place
her house and her services at your disposal for as long as you
required them. She is a charming and accomplished woman, and her
society will cheer and refresh you.”

“Very well,” said Eirene, rising. “I hardly dare indulge hope for the
future, after what I have suffered to-day. You will pardon me if I
leave you now, monsieur. I can endure no more.”

“I am grieved to have been the means of inflicting this pain upon you,
madame.” M. Kirileff escorted her to the door, noticing the stony
glance of disdain she bestowed upon Maurice as she swept past him, and
returned to his seat with a complete change of manner, while the monks
pushed forward to listen.

“I need not waste much time on you,” he said contemptuously to Maurice
and Zoe. “You know why you are here, and the step you must take to
obtain your release. Until you take that step, you may be very sure
you will remain in safe custody. Understand that you are prisoners, no
longer guests. We do not propose to furnish troublesome people like
you with the luxuries of a first-class hotel. You will see that the
man is placed in one of your dungeons,” he added authoritatively to
Papa Athanasios, “and the woman in one of the less commodious cells
reserved for female pilgrims.”

“But, lord, the dungeons have not been used for hundreds of years!”
protested the monk in his bad French.

“Then have one cleared for the prisoner. If there are rats, so much
the better. It is unnecessary for me to use threats,” he addressed
Maurice again; “your own mind--dull-witted Englishman though you
are--will paint the truth for you. Here you are, and here you stay
until you write out and sign the confession I shall leave you. No one
knows where you are, or would think of looking for you here, and even
if your prison was known, an army could not rescue you. Her Royal
Highness is not vindictive, but we allow no tampering with the
heritage of a princess under Scythian protection. I may as well tell
you that your accomplice, the alleged British officer, is on the point
of leaving Emathia, on the plea that he is summoned back to his
military duties.”

“He doesn’t know Wylie, does he, Zoe?” said Maurice, as they were left
standing together for a moment while M. Kirileff conversed with the
Hegoumenos, and Papa Athanasios was absent preparing the dungeon.

“Of course not. Oh, Maurice, do you believe now what I said to you
about Eirene? I knew she would take it like this.”

“It’s only for the first few minutes,” said Maurice, unruffled. “When
she gets by herself, and this fellow isn’t by to make vile
suggestions, she’ll remember all we’ve been through together, and
she’ll know we simply couldn’t have meant any harm to her. Of course,
it was bound to give her a shock, but she’ll be frightfully sorry when
she realises the things she has said.”

“Maurice, you would contentedly lie down and let Eirene trample on
you! She is--no, I won’t say it.”

“It’s awfully hard on you, I know,” said Maurice. “I wish you could
dissociate yourself from me in some way.”

“As if I would ever give away your case! Why, it’s mine as much as
yours. No, we will stick to each other, Maurice, if all the Eirenes in
the world turn against us. I shall set to work on a novel at
once--making it up in my mind, of course. I have never been able to
find time to get to work absolutely undisturbed before. And you will
frame a plan for governing Emathia, no doubt. Dear boy, keep up
heart!”

The tears were in Zoe’s eyes as she spoke, and her cheerful voice
shook. Maurice patted her on the shoulder.

“All right, Zoe. Papa Athanasios will look after me, you may be sure.
Don’t get dismal. Wylie will be here before long, trust him. And don’t
think too hardly of Eirene.”

“Always Eirene!” Zoe stamped her foot as Maurice was led away. He
turned and nodded gaily to her, and a curious thought came into her
mind. “Could it be?” she asked of herself. “Shall I suggest it to
Maurice? No, it would be worse for him if it turned out not to be
true. I wish it might be that, for his sake--and hers and mine, too,
for the matter of that. But I don’t believe she could do it.”




 CHAPTER XVIII.
 “SPLENDIDE MENDAX.”

It seemed to Zoe that, save for the fact that Maurice’s place of
confinement was called a dungeon and hers a cell, the change in the
state of affairs pressed rather more hardly on her than on him. Her
new room was very small, very dirty, absolutely devoid of furniture,
and almost destitute of light, a small grated aperture just under the
ceiling offering the only approach to a window. Moreover, Maurice had
the friendly Papa Athanasios to look after him, while the old woman
who acted as Zoe’s gaoler seemed positively to gloat over her
humiliation. This attitude was in itself a challenge, and before Zoe
had been in her new quarters half an hour she had bullied old Marigo
into providing a broom and fetching her rug and other possessions from
the room she had occupied with Eirene. The cell looked much less
hopeless when a certain amount of the dust of ages had been removed,
the rug spread on the stone divan, and Zoe’s few clothes neatly rolled
up as cushions. In the homely work of tidying up, moreover, she wore
off some of her indignation against Eirene, and was able to turn her
mind to other subjects. Her words to Maurice had not been idle, or
designed merely to console him. The idea for a story had come into her
mind, and was working itself out all the more vividly for her removal
during the past month from her usual surroundings and pursuits. It was
going to be splendid, she felt, with the curious leaping of heart
which the self-development of a new theme always caused in her. If
only she had her note-books at hand! But since they were not to be
had, she must work more carefully than usual, more by rule and line,
so as to be able to reproduce the story from memory when she regained
her freedom. The whitewashed walls of her cell offered a ready-made
tablet for memoranda, and a rusty nail she had discovered in the
course of her sweepings would serve as a stylus. In marked contrast
with the excitement of the morning, she passed a quiet and perfectly
happy afternoon absorbed in blocking out her chapters, raising
horrible suspicions in the mind of her gaoler, who could only imagine
that the mysterious signs on the wall were some kind of sorcery
directed against the welfare of the monastery.

The next morning Zoe was at work again as soon as she had put her room
tidy, and it was with unconcealed impatience that she found herself
summoned by old Marigo to follow her. “Come, O girl, quickly!” she
could understand this, at any rate, though neither now nor at any
other time could she extract any rational information from the
wardress, as Maurice called her. Following her down the steep
time-worn stairs, she found Eirene, escorted by M. Kirileff, awaiting
her in the courtyard, and she was not too much engrossed with her
story to derive some pleasure from noticing that Eirene looked pale
and ill at ease. It was M. Kirileff who spoke, after receiving an
imperious gesture.

“Her Royal Highness is anxious even now to save you from the penalty
due to your brother’s obstinacy,” he said. “If you choose to sign the
confession I have drawn out, you will be permitted to attend her to
Therma, and she will graciously see that you are sent home from
there.”

“Thank you, I prefer to be here,” returned Zoe briskly. “You don’t
know what a kindness you are doing me by keeping me where there are no
visitors. I have not had an idle moment yet, and my time is fully
occupied far ahead.”

M. Kirileff looked unaffectedly astonished, and Eirene interposed, in
the languid tones of one weary of the subject.

“I regard you with compassion,” she said, “for I know that your facile
imagination can make the wildest dreams appear realities to you. Your
brother I cannot trust myself to see, for he has not the same excuse.
If it was you who suggested the imposture, and induced him to
acquiesce in it, I can only advise you to undo the harm you have done
in leading astray an otherwise worthy young man. The good Father
Athanasios will convey to him any message from you advising him to
submit, but no others.”

“I’m sorry you took the trouble to make such an arrangement, for it
won’t be wanted,” said Zoe. “And when you have had time to think
things over, and realise what you have done, I shall be sorry for you,
Eirene.”

“There is no use in prolonging this discussion, I think,” said Eirene
to M. Kirileff. “We are not likely to meet again,” she added, over her
shoulder, to Zoe, “but should you return to a better mind, I shall
have pleasure in extending my patronage to you.”

Zoe returned to her cell fuming, and it was some time before she was
sufficiently calm to resume her work, while Eirene turned away to
begin her journey to Therma in M. Kirileff’s company. He had horses,
servants and tents awaiting him below the rock, and a girl from the
village had been impressed to wait upon her. She was treated with the
utmost deference; her tent was pitched apart from the rest; her
pleasure was consulted as to the hours of halting or starting again;
but she was kept perpetually under surveillance. In her tent her maid
watched her; if she wandered outside it, two _cavasses_ kept her
faithfully in sight; on the march M. Kirileff, riding beside her, at
precisely the right distance to the rear, divided his attention
between her face and the track. He had a way of leading the
conversation round to Maurice and Zoe, or to her experiences in the
brigands’ camp, but her replies baffled him. They told so little that
he could draw no conclusions, and they expressed still less. It was
with a mixture of resentment and relief that he handed her over at
last to the care of Madame Ladoguin, and gave his final instructions
to that lady in private.

“I hope you may have better success with our charming Princess than I
have had,” he said. “I no longer wonder that she was able to plan and
effect her escape from Scythia as she did.”

“Well, you could hardly expect her, after her late experiences, to
confide in so youthful and _débonnaire_ a person as yourself, could
you?” smiled his hostess. “But with a woman, and one who has seen
something of her world, it may be different.”

“If there is any one in the world who can win her confidence, it is
Chariclea Feodorovna,” said M. Kirileff, with every appearance of
fervent conviction; “and I only trust she may.”

“Why?” the quick note of alarm in the lady’s voice showed that she
scented danger. “You don’t imagine that she has any sympathy with the
impostor?”

“None whatever--at present; but with a woman one always fears a change
of mind. There is something most wearisomely convincing about the
youth Smith. A man of any other nation, convicted of base treachery in
the presence of a lady whose good opinion he must surely prize, would
have protested, entreated, asseverated his innocence. But this stolid
Englishman does not even give himself the trouble to offer a
statement. He contents himself with asserting that he is in the right,
in a tone which implies that it signifies nothing whether she believes
it or not, and proceeds to drive her to frenzy by insisting on his
pretensions. There is something impressive in this brutal simplicity.”

“Quite so,” said Mme. Ladoguin. “And you think it impressed her, or
will yet succeed in doing so?”

“I am trusting to your influence that it may not. I will own that I
have had moments of alarm. I imagined that I distinguished on her face
a look resembling relief when I first revealed to her the nature of
the deception. But it passed quickly when I pointed out its sordid
motive, and the _bourgeois_ origin of the plotters. A peasant would
have been infinitely more welcome as a rival than a respectable youth
of the middle class.”

“But I had the idea that these Teffanys--these Smiths, I should
say--belonged to the _petite noblesse_, what the English call
‘gentry,’” said Mme. Ladoguin. M. Kirileff smiled meaningly.

“That is an idea I must beg you to banish from your mind. For the
purposes of conversation with the Princess, they are of a superior
order of agriculturists. I brought the thing home to her when I
pointed out that she would have been offered a marriage with young
Smith as the price of her life had she fallen into the hands of
Panagiotis.”

“You have prepared the ground well, Boris Constantinovitch. She
exhibited disgust?”

“More than disgust--agony. And thereupon the innocent Monsieur Smith
spoils the effect by demanding with fury what I have been saying to
make her unhappy!”

“Ah, these unrehearsed effects--how they ruin our best scenes! But the
young man is certainly impossible. I suppose”--with sudden
keenness--“it has not struck you to hint to the young lady that in
case of any further escapades on her part, Scythia might be driven to
abandon her claim, and take up that of this pretender instead? That
would make it easier to manage her.”

“You terrify me!” cried M. Kirileff, with genuine alarm. “Is it
possible you do not see that our only hold over her is to maintain her
in the assurance that hers is the only claim worth considering? The
merest suggestion that the youth might conceivably have right on his
side would ruin everything. Down would go the barrier of disgust I
have erected with so much pains, she would see herself as the usurper
instead of him, and even if we continued to support her, the moral
support of her own whole-hearted confidence in her rights would be
gone.”

“I see,” said Mme. Ladoguin slowly. “Well, frankly, if that is the
case, I wonder at your bringing her here. I will keep a careful watch
over her, of course; but in a place like this there are endless
opportunities for mischief. Panagiotis is always at hand, and that
Captain Wylie is a perfect terror. Since he was tricked into paying
the ransom without rescuing his friends, he has given the city no
peace. The consular body are just as tired of him as the authorities
are, and he is bringing the Ambassadors at Czarigrad into the matter.
He is certain to insist on seeing the Princess when he finds out she
is here, to try and discover from her where the Smiths are, and he may
persuade her of the truth of their claims.”

“He must not see her,” was the prompt reply. “Do you think I should
have entrusted her to your care if I had not had full confidence in
you? You must manage--somehow--anyhow--to keep them apart. A word to
the doctor will ensure a certain amount of quiet and retirement for
the Princess--she sees only your very intimate friends, and no
foreigners, you perceive? Your brother will keep you informed of
Captain Wylie’s movements, and when he is in the city you will go to
no place where you would be likely to meet him, and you will take care
that the direction of your drives does not leak out through the
servants. He will scarcely force his way into the Consulate, or if he
did, I have no doubt your husband would repel force with force, and
public opinion would justify him. If he should obtain an entrance by
any stratagem, I can trust you to deal with him.”

“Oh, I’m not afraid of that. It is the scandal, the unpleasantness.
The man is so atrociously persistent.”

“I understand. I don’t mind telling you that I dislike this delay in
Therma as much as you can. But what is to be done? It is all very well
to give out that the Princess went on pilgrimage, but every one in the
Court circle knows the real state of the case, and she cannot be
received as if nothing had happened. Their Imperial Majesties are
deeply incensed. I shall represent as strongly as I can the expediency
of bringing her back quickly, and you must prevail upon her to write a
letter of penitence and submission, which will help matters on. Short
of a convent--and I should not care to trust her in one outside
Scythia--she is safer with you than she could be anywhere else.”

“I suppose a letter signed by her would not be sufficient?”

M. Kirileff shook his head. “It would appear too casual. No, the
writing must be her own throughout. But I hope much from your
persuasions. You will keep constantly before her, of course, the peril
and disgrace from which she has been rescued, and point out that her
only hope for the future lies in a return to Court favour. One warning
I must give you. Don’t attempt to represent the young man Smith as a
plotter, or as intending anything but the most honourable and
_bourgeois_ of marriages. One glance at his face shows you that he is
absolutely incapable of the slightest approach to art or _finesse_ of
any kind. Remember that he is a mere tool in the hands of the
remorseless Panagiotis, who spares no one who comes in the way of his
schemes.”

“I will remember,” laughed the lady. “It is a comfort that you think
the Princess is willing to be persuaded.”

“I do, but I think she needs to be kept in the same mind. I saw signs
of wavering myself, on the morning we left Hadgi-Antoniou, when she
expressed a wish to see Smith’s sister in private. I pointed out that
the girl--who is endowed with more vivacity than her brother--might
very probably, in her rage at the discovery of their plot, attempt
some violence, and she agreed at once that I had better be present.
That is the sort of assistance I hope for from you--an unobtrusive
influence constantly exerted, both to protect her from intrusion and
to turn her thoughts in the right direction.”

This conference put Eirene’s two guardians into a state of the highest
mutual appreciation, and M. Kirileff went on his way to Scythia with
an easy mind, leaving his confederate to make Eirene’s life a burden
to her. The next few weeks were the most absolutely miserable the girl
had ever experienced, for she knew exactly what Maurice and Zoe must
think of her, and she had no means of fulfilling the task she had set
herself. The realisation of the part she must play had come to her in
a flash as she sat beside the Hegoumenos on the divan, and listened to
the measured periods of M. Kirileff. Her first feeling had been
something more than the relief he had read in her face--positive
triumph. She had been right, after all, when she suspected Maurice of
being a prince in disguise. But even as the thought crossed her mind,
she read in the Scythian’s expression that she had betrayed herself,
and she saw her course clear before her. To remain at Hadgi-Antoniou,
throwing in her lot with that of Maurice and Zoe, would do no good.
The monastery which had guarded the faith for centuries could guard
secrets as well. The prisoners might remain in a living death,
unsuspected by the outside world, while it would be announced to
Europe that they had met their fate at the hands of the brigands. The
Embassies would demand an indemnity and the punishment of the
murderers, and Scythia would supply the Roumi Government with the
necessary money, while the crime would be added to the record of the
next few criminals who had not the wherewithal to grease the palms of
justice. Even Wylie would be deceived by a circumstantial story,
perhaps by the production of relics of his friends, and would return
sorrowfully to India, taking away their last hope. Eirene saw it all,
even while she called up the look of resentment and disgust which had
assured M. Kirileff of the success of his rearrangement of facts. She
must efface from his mind the memory of her momentary slip, she must
deceive even Maurice and Zoe, lest he should see in their faces that
he was being played with. She must return to civilisation, and in some
way communicate with Wylie, and that she might do this, she must throw
dust in the eyes of friend and foe alike.

It was a curious feature of her state of mind that the momentous news
which she had heard from M. Kirileff scarcely occurred to her, except
as a cogent reason why Maurice and Zoe would not be allowed to go free
save as discredited and self-confessed impostors. She did not ask
herself what its effect might be on her own future, for the exigencies
of the present occupied all her thoughts. The magnitude of her task
kept her sleepless during her last night at the monastery, and led her
to the desperate attempt, which M. Kirileff had frustrated, to secure
Zoe as a confederate. It would be so much easier to communicate with
Wylie, or with some British representative, if there were two to watch
for opportunities instead of one, that she conceived the idea of
inducing Zoe to make an apparent submission and accompany her. The
envoy’s watchfulness had not only destroyed this hope, but had obliged
her to deepen the bitterness with which Zoe must regard her, and she
entered on the journey with feelings almost of despair. Without
protest she acquiesced in M. Kirileff’s suggestion that it should be
announced that her Royal Highness had returned from a pilgrimage to
the shrine of Hadgi-Antoniou, and was resting at Therma after the
hardships she had undergone, while the friends who had shared with her
the experience of being captured by brigands were making a more
extended tour among the rock monasteries near the Morean frontier. The
announcement would, at any rate, give Wylie some idea of the
whereabouts of his friends, and surely, surely, it must lead him to
insist on seeing her, and learning from her the true state of the
case.

But in this forecast Eirene had reckoned without Chariclea Feodorovna,
and the very capable staff of assistants she had gathered round her.
The Princess was received with the tenderest affection and respect,
and promptly bound hand and foot with bonds too imperceptible to
resent, too strong to break. The doctor who was called in to prescribe
for her shattered nerves ordered quiet and retirement, with a very
little society of a cheerful and familiar kind. What could be more in
accordance with the prescription than to limit Eirene’s visitors to
selected members of the Scythian colony and a few favoured
representatives of those other Powers which were in sympathy with
Scythian aims? At the same time, Madame Ladoguin, whose own appearance
was a testimony to her skill, took in hand the restoration of her
guest’s complexion, which had suffered from a month’s exposure to all
kinds of weather, without the protection of hat or veil. It was clear
that Eirene could not appear at the Scythian Court--whither she was so
soon to return--with a brown face and red hands, and her adviser acted
the beneficent tyrant to the life, forbidding her to go out on days
when a particular wind--or any wind--was blowing, and applying healing
balms which required, in order to produce their full effect, that the
patient should spend a day in bed. Resistance was useless, and Eirene
acquiesced helplessly for fear of arousing suspicion, but in one thing
she would not yield. All Madame Ladoguin’s persuasions and
encouragements could not induce her to write the desired letter of
penitence to the Scythian Court. To such expedients was she driven
that she would spend whole mornings in writing out drafts of the
letter and making beginnings, which were all torn up. “I will not
leave Therma until I have done something to help Maurice and Zoe,” she
said to herself. “After that, it doesn’t signify what happens to me. I
suppose I must go back to Pavelsburg, but I won’t write what isn’t
true to make them treat me better. Maurice wouldn’t, and I won’t.”

All this time Wylie made no sign. As soon as she reached Therma,
Eirene had asked her hostess about him, saying frankly that she wished
to thank him for his efforts in procuring her ransom; but she was told
that he had returned to India, satisfied that his friends were safe.
She did not believe this, but she thought it very probable that he
wished it to be believed, in order that he might have more freedom to
act, and in her drives she looked narrowly among the crowd of many
nationalities that thronged the streets for the tell-tale eyes which
no disguise could hide. But she never saw them. Once or twice she
ventured casually to inquire of Madame Ladoguin’s guests if they knew
anything of Captain Wylie, and was always assured, with a look of
astonishment, that he had made himself only too well known in the city
while he remained there, but that he had now, happily, left it. Still,
this did not necessarily prove that he had not returned to it, and
Eirene began to wonder whether she could not write to him, as he
seemed so strangely slow in seeking her. She did not know his address,
but the British Consul-General would certainly forward a letter. Would
it be best to send it by post or by one of the servants? So far as she
knew, she was free to correspond with any one she would, and it was
merely the feeling that she had very careful and subtle adversaries to
deal with that made her hesitate. She could not afford unsuccessful
experiments. If it was discovered that she was attempting to
communicate with Wylie, the fact would give the lie to the attitude
she had so resolutely maintained, and even if it were only discovered
that she had written to him, it would enable the Ladoguins to
anticipate any step he might take.

Curiously enough, the danger attending both the means of communication
she had contemplated was made clear to her on the same day. She was
well supplied with money, and had been occupied in the very necessary
task of getting some new clothes. One of her orders had been sent to a
British firm in Vindobona. It was written in Eirene’s name by Madame
Ladoguin, who acted as a kind of unofficial lady-in-waiting, but it
chanced that she was called out of the room before it was finished,
and Eirene addressed and fastened the envelope in a hurry, in order to
catch the post. The answer arrived in due time, but the tradesman
begged to know whether there had been more than one enclosure, as the
letter had been skilfully unclosed and refastened before it reached
him. The incident spoke volumes as to the safety of letters confided
to the Consulate post-bag, and Eirene realised that, though she had
not discovered it, she was under as strict surveillance as that which
had proved so irksome on the journey. Was it safe to attempt to bribe
the servants, she wondered? They all seemed anxious to oblige--even,
so it struck her, to be bribed--especially Madame Ladoguin’s French
maid, whose services she shared. Were they also spies, eager to tempt
her to employ them, that they might carry a report to their mistress?
An impulse, for which she could not account, prompted her to look at
the money with which she had been furnished. It was all in gold, and
every coin was marked with a tiny scratch in exactly the same place.
Eirene gave up the idea of bribing the servants.

One attempt she did actually make, which might have ended more
disastrously than it did. She was driving with Madame Ladoguin, and
the latter had stopped the carriage at a shop in order to leave a
message. Before the _cavass_ had time to return, she caught sight of a
lady advancing towards the carriage.

“Pardon, dearest Princess!” she said, stepping out hastily, “but that
is the Pannonian Consul-General’s wife, who has not been presented to
you. I won’t inflict her on you, if you will permit me to go to her,
for she is a sad bore.”

Not guessing that the lady in question was really the wife of the
British Consul-General, and one of the persons in all Therma whom
Madame Ladoguin least wished her to meet, Eirene looked round for some
means of utilising this opportunity. The programme of a concert which
was to take place for some charity lay on the seat opposite her, and
she snatched it up and wrote on it in pencil:--

“The Princess Eirene Féofan will be glad to receive Captain Wylie at
any time convenient to him. Let him see that his name is taken to her
direct.”

She folded the paper, addressed it to the care of the British
Consul-General, and beckoned to a beggar whom the absence of the
_cavass_ had tempted to draw near the carriage. In her hand she held a
gold piece.

“For Sir Frank Francis, at the Consulate of Great Britain,” she
whispered in French. “This is for you, if you will take it to him.”

He looked up at her with greedy, uncomprehending eyes, and she waved
him hastily away as Madame Ladoguin turned round. “The British
Consul-General!” she repeated, in an agony, and saw that he understood
her; but he shambled away down an alley in the opposite direction to
that in which the British Consulate lay. Eirene never heard anything
more of him or her message, but she realised gradually that she ought
to be thankful she had lighted on a rogue too unsophisticated to
double his gains by carrying it to the Scythian instead of the British
Consul-General.




 CHAPTER XIX.
 ART WITH A PURPOSE.

Akin to Eirene’s feelings at this time were those of Wylie. As soon
as he heard of her arrival in Therma he tried to see her, but was
assured that she was too ill to receive visitors. Losing no time, he
took ship with Armitage for Morea, and paid a sufficiently exhaustive
visit to the rock monasteries on that side of the frontier to make
sure that his friends were not and had not been at any of them. There
remained only Hadgi-Antoniou, but on trying to penetrate to it he was
promptly turned back by the frontier guards, who asserted that he was
attempting to lead a Greek band into Emathian territory. Returning to
Therma, with the intention of reaching the monastery from thence, he
found himself confronted with obstacles of every description. The Vali
had become intolerably solicitous for his safety, and refused to let
him go without an escort, while declining either to provide the escort
or to allow Wylie to raise one for himself. It was the same with the
purveyors of guides, horses, servants, all the necessaries of a
traveller, but Wylie was stolidly combating one objection after
another, when the distant sight one day of Eirene in the Ladoguins’
carriage gave a new direction to his thoughts. His determination to
see her was, however, only the prelude to a fresh series of
disappointments. Once, and only once, he obtained an entrance into the
Scythian Consulate, where he was received by Madame Ladoguin, who in
honeyed accents conveyed to him her Royal Highness’s thanks for his
past services, and regret that she was unable to see him. Entreaties,
arguments, threats, fell powerless against the armour of her suave
impenetrability, and though Wylie retired with the determination to
try his luck another day, he was not admitted again.

After this, he tried writing to Eirene. His first letter was answered
in her name by Madame Ladoguin, and conveyed the same message that he
had already received from her lips, but couched in more formal terms,
as though to rebuke his presumptuous importunity. Two or three
succeeding letters remained unanswered, and those that followed were
returned unopened. Bribery was the next resort, and he found many
itching palms among the servants and underlings of the Consulate; but
it was not long before he was forced to the conclusion that none of
his messages had been allowed to reach their destination.

There was a certain obstinacy in Wylie that refused to be baffled. He
watched the doors of the Consulate, he laid ambushes at spots which
Madame Ladoguin and her guest were likely to pass in their drives. But
his adversaries were equally obstinate, and far more subtle. Nicetas
Mitsopoulo dogged his movements with unfailing watchfulness, and
reported daily, sometimes hourly, to his sister. False information as
to the direction to be taken by the ladies in their drives was
liberally supplied, and the carriage never issued from the Consulate
when Wylie was on the watch. And yet his persistence was not without
its effect at last. An Englishwoman would have said that it got upon
Madame Ladoguin’s nerves. If this wretched Englishman continued to
picket the approaches to her house in this way, some accident must at
length give him the interview which he sought, for she could not
always be on the watch everywhere. After mature consideration, and
consultation with her brother, she took one of those bold steps which
are possible only to great minds. She called on the wife of the
British Consul-General and requested a private interview, in the
course of which she complained to her with deep regret of the
ungentlemanly conduct of one of her husband’s nationals. This person
had been one of the party captured by brigands at the same time as
Madame Ladoguin’s royal guest, and had so far presumed upon the
circumstance as to fall violently in love with the Princess, and to
persecute her, even now that she had returned to civilisation, with
attentions that were as insulting as they were undesired. He waylaid
her daily, bribed servants to convey amorous notes to her, and had
filled her with such terror and disgust that she could scarcely bring
herself to venture beyond the precincts of the Consulate.

To Lady Francis this revelation supplied at once a key to Wylie’s
persistent efforts, and a new and intense interest in life. In all
innocence she lent herself to Madame Ladoguin’s manipulation, moved by
a sincere pity for him, coupled with a gratifying sense of personal
importance in thus becoming involved in the love affairs of a royal
personage. She conveyed Madame Ladoguin’s appeal to her husband, and
Sir Frank, who liked Wylie and was now doubly sorry for him, requested
his presence, and talked to him like a father.

“No discredit to you--most natural, I’m sure--but you see, in the case
of a young lady of such high rank, this sort of thing won’t do,” was
the burden of his song, and the impossibility of convincing him of the
truth drove Wylie nearly frantic. Sir Frank persisted in regarding his
solemn denials as attempts not to compromise the lady, and sturdily
demanded why he laid wait for her and annoyed her with letters if he
was not in love with her.

“But don’t you see, sir,” cried Wylie at last, “that the Princess is
the last person who saw the Smiths? I only want to know from her the
truth about them.”

“But you have heard that they are exploring among the monasteries. Why
should you wish to discredit the Princess’s word and that of M.
Kirileff?”

“Why haven’t the Smiths written to me? Why can I find out nothing
about them? They must want clothes and things--and money. How can they
go exploring without it?”

“I see,” said Sir Frank, beginning for the first time to regard the
mystery as something more than a figment of Wylie’s brain. “But what
exactly do you want to find out from the Princess?”

“I want to ask her where she left them, and in what circumstances, and
how they proposed to manage.”

“But you don’t need a private interview for that.”

“I have never asked for a private interview, sir. I shall be delighted
to ask her the questions in the presence of yourself and Ladoguin and
the full staff of both Consulates.”

“Well, perhaps Lady Francis and Madame Ladoguin would be sufficient
for the purpose, and less alarming to the young lady,” chuckled Sir
Frank. “I’ll see about it, then. You leave the matter in my hands, and
don’t hang about the Scythian Consulate meanwhile--you understand?”

Wylie acquiesced and departed, to rage furiously over the matter in
the hearing of Armitage, who was still waiting at Therma to see him
through his troubles, and incidentally to make Emathian sketches for
the ‘Plastic.’ He listened placidly to Wylie’s wrathful
declaration--when his fury at the absolute injustice and stupidity of
the accusation allowed him intelligible utterance--that he had been
made to look a fool before the whole city. Not even the suggestion of
ungentlemanly behaviour appeared to sting him so deeply as the charge
of having fallen in love with Eirene.

“Calm yourself,” said the artist coolly, when Wylie had anathematised
all concerned to an extent that seemed to him sufficient. “You are the
lion in the net; well, will you allow me the honour of being the
mouse?”

“What’s this?” growled Wylie, taking up the large envelope addressed
to Eirene which his friend placed before him.

“That is a letter from Princess Florence, Duchess of Inverness,
introducing an English artist of the name of Armitage to the Princess
Eirene Féofan, whom H.R.H. met in France in the spring.”

“And how in the world did you get to know the Duchess of Inverness?”

“I really don’t know, unless I say like the old Italian chap, ‘I also
am a painter.’ I had the cheek to ask for a letter in her own writing,
lest the Ladoguins should suppress it and answer it themselves, like
yours. Of course, I didn’t say why I was so anxious to see Princess
Eirene, but the lady-in-waiting says that the Duchess has suggested
she should let me wait upon her with my sketches, and perhaps paint
her portrait if she happens to want it done. So I suppose she thinks
I’m hard up.”

“Well, and am I to go instead of you?” demanded Wylie.

“Oh, blessed innocence! Do you think you would ever be admitted into
the Scythian Consulate if you brought a letter from the Emperor of
Scythia himself? or that your appearance, and especially your eyes,
aren’t known to every bootboy about the place? Of course I shall go.
You don’t catch me abusing the Duchess’s kindness by sending an
objectionable fire-eater like you--objectionable to Scythia, I
mean--to represent me. But I shall have a try at doing your business.
What is it you want exactly?”

“To see her, to know from her own lips what has become of them!” cried
Wylie. “Tell her that if I still hear nothing of them I shall follow
her wherever she goes until I get the truth out of her.”

“Gently. This is eminently a case for the use of guile. Now let us
devise a scheme. You must remember that it’s quite possible you won’t
be allowed to see her even now. Let us try if we can’t arrange it so
that I may manage to get hold of the needed information in any case.”

They laid their plans, and in due time Armitage delivered his letter
at the Consulate, where it caused great searchings of heart. As he had
anticipated, it proved impossible to treat an introduction from the
art-loving British Princess in the cavalier fashion which was good
enough for Wylie’s notes, and he was gratified by an intimation that
the Princess Eirene would receive him the next day. When he presented
himself with his portfolio of sketches, it was no surprise to him to
be received first by Madame Ladoguin, who desired to impress upon him,
with an unspeakably frank air of taking him into her inmost
confidence, that he must not mention in her Royal Highness’s hearing
the name of Captain Wylie. He had probably learnt from the rumours of
the city of that person’s extraordinary behaviour with regard to the
Princess, but he could not possibly guess what pain it had given her.
Armitage faced the ambassador with a mien as open as her own.

“Thanks so much for telling me,” he said, in his boyish way. “I don’t
suppose I should, in any case, have mentioned him unless the Princess
had done it first, but now I’ll be extra careful.”

When he was ushered into Eirene’s presence, he caught a momentary look
of disappointment on her face, a glance to see whether any one was
following him, which told him in a moment that she had been cherishing
the wild hope of seeing Wylie in disguise. The discovery took away
half the difficulty of his task, by resolving at once the question
whether she was or was not a willing accomplice in the conspiracy of
silence. The weary languor of her tones when she asked him where he
had studied, and how the Duchess had become acquainted with him, was
welcome, as calculated to lull the suspicions of Mme. Ladoguin. It was
quickly evident, however, that no temporary assurance was to be
allowed to blind that lady’s vigilance. She stood between Eirene and
Armitage, and handed to the former each sketch as it was taken from
the portfolio. It was not until the entire contents had passed through
her hands that she retreated to the end of the table, and sat down
with some fancy work. Armitage observed that the work was not of a
very engrossing nature, for while her hands were busy with it, her
eyes were free to roam as before. Eirene was still looking through the
sketches, now guaranteed harmless by her guardian herself.

“It has been a great pleasure to me to see your work,” she said
graciously to the painter. “I only wish you had brought more
portraits. The Duchess of Inverness says you have painted a
half-length of the Duke for her.”

“I have a photograph of it here, ma’am,” and Armitage took the card
from a pocket in the portfolio, contriving rather ostentatiously to
exhibit first one side and then the other to the vigilant gaze of Mme.
Ladoguin, somewhat in the manner of the conjurer who desires to assure
his audience that there is no deception.

“Yes, I like that very much,” said Eirene, after studying the
photograph carefully; “but I have never seen the Duke--or indeed any
of the people you have shown me. Have you no portrait of any one I
know?”

“Only one, I’m afraid, ma’am--a sketch of Captain Wylie,” with a
deprecating glance at Madame Ladoguin.

“I must have missed that. Let me see it, please.” Armitage produced
the portrait from under the others, where Madame Ladoguin had
dexterously slipped it instead of passing it on to Eirene. It was a
pencil sketch, worked up with a good deal of care. One foot
impatiently advanced, Wylie seemed almost to be stepping out of the
picture, with a look of reckless resolution on his face.

“Oh, this is lifelike. How well I know that expression!” said Eirene,
with a smile and a sigh over the memories called up by the portrait.
“But the picture should be coloured. Nothing can do justice to Captain
Wylie that does not show the colour of his eyes.”

“This is merely a rough sketch, ma’am. I happened to catch him in an
attitude I liked. I tell him I shall work it up into a picture of him
terrorising an army with a riding-whip, _à la_ General Gordon.”

“You will be obliged to alter the background, then. Why place a
soldier in such sylvan surroundings?”

“Oh, that was a bit of woodland I wanted to get in somewhere,” said
the artist frankly. “I was rather proud of it, because I thought I had
got the look of that particular kind of bush rather well. You don’t
like it, ma’am?” with some disappointment. “Perhaps if you saw it in a
better light----?” He moved towards the window, and Eirene turned in
her chair.

“I see you have made him sign it. What a bold hand he writes!” she
observed easily. “Yes, Mr Armitage, I think I did you an injustice.
The growth of that particular shrub must be very difficult to render.
It is the sweet-scented plant that grows in thickets, is it not?”

She spoke lightly, almost at random, for Armitage had placed the
sketch in her hands upside-down, and all the shading of the bushes was
discernible as writing.


 “You must manage to receive me. When can I see you? Where are the
 Smiths? I am certain there has been foul play. I have been trying in
 every possible way for weeks to get an interview with you, but have
 been assured that you refused it. Only tell me where Smith and his
 sister are, and how to help them, and I will give you no more trouble.
 You cannot be so heartless as to abandon them to no one knows what
 fate.--James Graham Wylie.”


“When was this taken? Captain Wylie looks thinner than when I saw
him,” Eirene went on.

“Two days ago, ma’am.”

“Two days ago? but not here? He is not in Therma? I have several times
said that I wished to receive Captain Wylie, to thank him for his
services to me, but I was always assured he had returned to India.
What does this mean?”

“He is staying at my hotel, ma’am, and I know he is most anxious to
wait on you.” Armitage cast a glance at Madame Ladoguin which blended
cleverly perplexity and a request for pardon, and she responded to it.

“I am grieved to tell you, madame, that since Captain Wylie’s return
to Therma, his conduct has been such as to call down the reprobation
even of his own Consul. The kindest thing is to attribute it to a
disordered brain. I can’t enter into the details, but it is absolutely
impossible for you to receive him.”

“I see,” said Eirene, with a slight frown. “I must ask you, Mr
Armitage, to inform Captain Wylie that it is not convenient to me to
receive him.”

“It is not for me to question your decision, ma’am,” said the artist,
“but I think I could explain things to your satisfaction if you would
allow it?” She made no sign, and he continued bluntly, “I fancy,
ma’am, that my friend could dispense with paying his respects if you
would be good enough to send him the information he wants about Mr and
Miss Smith.”

Eirene raised her eyebrows. “I thought it was understood that when I
parted from them they were in perfect health?” she said.

“And cheerfulness, madame,” put in Madame Ladoguin. “You have
mentioned to me more than once Miss Smith’s extreme cheerfulness when
you quitted her.”

“Yes,” said Eirene, with a little smile, “I rather resented her
cheerfulness, for I did not like her staying behind, and had exhausted
all my powers of persuasion to induce her to return with me to Therma,
but in vain. I am afraid that is all I can tell you, Mr Armitage. And
now about your own work. Could you undertake a portrait of me--now,
while I am still here?”

“I should be highly honoured, ma’am.”

“Then let us decide----” began Eirene, but Madame Ladoguin interposed.

“Dearest Princess, pardon me, but what will Dr Simovics say? He
ordered you complete rest from anything that might try the nerves, and
you have no idea of the strain of sitting for a portrait. If you like,
I can send and ask his advice, but I fear I know what his answer will
be.”

“So do I,” said Eirene resentfully. “This means that I must give up my
portrait, then. But I must have a picture of yours,” turning to
Armitage. “I wonder”--she took up some of the sketches--“whether you
would object to try a view of Hadgi-Antoniou from my description
merely? I like the pictures of the Morean monasteries extremely, but
as I have never seen them they do not appeal to me as Hadgi-Antoniou
does.”

“I will try my best, ma’am; but I fear the picture would not be very
satisfactory. If you could give me just a rough sketch of your
own----?”

“Unfortunately I can’t draw at all. But I suppose I could show you
roughly what it is like. I should like a picture of the church, but I
know it would be hopeless for me to try to do that. The view must be
from the ground below. Now you must not laugh at my crude efforts,” as
Armitage supplied her with a pencil and an unused sheet of paper. “The
rock goes up, up, nearly straight, like this, and the monastery is at
the very top, hanging over in some places. This is the rope and net by
which visitors are drawn up. These things which look like caterpillars
on the face of the rock are ladders. The monks must have some more to
bridge the gaps, but I never saw them in use, and I don’t know where
they keep them. Here at the edge of the summit are the monks’ gardens.
Don’t expect me to draw bushes as you do.” She was scribbling with
intense energy, and Armitage, looking over her, read--


 “They are here--Z. in pilgrims’ rooms, M. in underground dungeon.
 Monks are divided into two parties, Greek and Thracian. Hegoumenos and
 Greeks friendly but timid. Thracians under Scythian orders. Greeks
 will yield to definite order from Œcumenical Patriarch for release of
 prisoners. Be prepared to bribe Thracians heavily, and to threaten, or
 even use, force. Be secret, or prisoners may be removed.”


“This is an overhanging forest, ma’am, I presume?” asked Armitage.
Eirene laughed consciously.

“Oh no, only bushes, and in some places grass.”

“Then--pardon me--I think, perhaps, this kind of touch would express
it better.” He took the pencil, and wrote--


 “Are you in danger? Can we help you first?”


“I think I shall get you to give me some drawing lessons,” said Eirene
admiringly. “Is this it?” and she wrote--


 “You can do nothing for me. I shall be taken back to Scythia. Show
 disappointment about the portrait.”


“If I might venture to offer a suggestion, ma’am, bushes don’t
generally wear their branches on the outside,” said Armitage drily,
taking the pencil again, and covering Eirene’s writing with light and
dark shading bearing a sufficient resemblance to foliage.

“I really must have some lessons,” said she, with renewed admiration.
“Chariclea, you are not to tell me that Dr Simovics would object to
that.”

“Alas, dearest Princess!” lamented Mme. Ladoguin, who was firm in a
not unnatural determination to save herself the wear and tear of the
perpetual surveillance any further visits from the artist would
entail. “The doctor was most particular in ordering complete rest for
mind and eye and hand.”

“If I might have the honour of painting your portrait, ma’am,”
ventured Armitage, “I am sure I could manage so that you would find
the sittings very little strain. Once we had settled on a
characteristic attitude, you could move about as you liked.”

“I knew it wouldn’t be so bad,” said Eirene triumphantly. “You hear,
Chariclea?”

“How unfortunate I am, compelled to represent the doctor, and bear the
odium of his measures!” cried Mme. Ladoguin distractedly. “I can only
say as I did before, let us ask him, madame.”

“I know what that means,” said Eirene, with a pout. “A princess in
disgrace is a very helpless person, Mr Armitage.”

“You don’t know what a disappointment it is to me, ma’am,” he
answered, while Madame Ladoguin made a deprecating movement. “I had
hoped so much from the Duchess’s introduction.”

“When you see her you must tell her that it was not my fault,” said
Eirene, scribbling vigorously. “The rock is grey, the walls are white,
the roofs red tiles, the bushes grey-green, the sky very blue. I have
written the colour on each, so that you may remember. There,
Chariclea, what do you think of it?”

Madame Ladoguin viewed the work of art with a caustic eye.

“Indeed, madame, I fear I should hardly recognise Hadgi-Antoniou from
your picture of it.”

“Then you must make it right, Mr Armitage,” said Eirene, rising. “Cure
its defects instead of mine, if you please.”




 CHAPTER XX.
 BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION.

“Now that you have your information,” said Armitage, when he had
recounted to Wylie what had passed during his audience of Eirene,
“what do you think of doing?”

“There can’t be much doubt about that. We must go to Czarigrad and get
hold of the Patriarch. Panagiotis must go, I suppose, as he is the
only one likely to have influence in that quarter, and I must go to
keep him up to the mark when he gets discouraged.”

“You won’t exactly publish abroad the object of your journey, I
suppose?”

“What do you take me for? We go to Czarigrad to stir up the Embassy,
of course.”

“And what is my part in the programme?”

“To stay here and keep an eye on Princess Eirene, I presume. She may
manage to send us some further particulars. You are sure she is
staunch?”

“Not a doubt of it, and wild to give what help she can, I should say.
All right, I’ll look out. But how if at the same time I make
unostentatious preparations for a visit to Hadgi-Antoniou, for the
purpose of painting a picture of it for the devout and orthodox
Imperial Princess Eirene Theophanis? She gave me a commission for the
outside, and said she would like one of the church as well. They will
probably grant me a passport all right, if you are known to be safe at
Czarigrad, for it won’t do to keep all Europeans away from
Hadgi-Antoniou, or people will begin to think there’s something wrong
there. Sir Frank will back me up, too, when he has got you off his
mind. Then you must cover up your tracks at Czarigrad, and come
across, preferably by sea, and join me without passing through Therma.
There’s a little port called Myriaki where we could rendezvous
comfortably, and at the worst I can leave one of my servants behind
and take you in his place.”

“You must have done a good deal of thinking between the Scythian
Consulate and here,” said Wylie drily.

“Ah, you don’t know how my brain works when it’s put to it. I’m bound
to see this thing through now. How are you off for the wherewithal?”

“Oh, the Professor has just come into another quarter’s income, and
he’s quite chirpy.”

“That’s all right for Czarigrad, but at Hadgi-Antoniou we may have to
outbid the Scythian agent. I can raise anything up to a
thousand--shall I do it?”

“I suppose it would be as well,” said Wylie unwillingly. “It sounds
awfully odd to hear you talking about ‘we,’” he explained, rather
ashamed of his coldness. “I seem to have let you in for a good deal,
when you remember that the Smiths have nothing to do with you.”

“Well, for the matter of that, they have nothing to do with you
either, have they? It was a mere accident of association that brought
you together. Of course, you went through a lot in their company, but
I hope I may do what little I can to help an English lady in distress,
though I haven’t had the honour of being introduced to her.”

“Right you are! You must think me a surly brute. I’m glad you have
pulled me up--honestly I am. I suppose I might have gone on to wish
the Smiths not to be rescued unless I had the chief hand in it.”

“You shall have the chief hand in it, so far as it depends on me,”
said Armitage heartily. “After all you have done, it would be a black
shame to rob you of the honour. I’m under your orders, remember, and
you may be sure I shall say so. I’ll get things ready here, while you
do the Czarigrad part of the business, and then we’ll meet and achieve
our final _coup_ in company.”

There was no hesitation in Wylie’s agreement, but during the next week
or two he was inclined to consider that Armitage had chosen
conspicuously the easier task. Nothing but iron resolution on his part
would have dragged the Professor to Czarigrad, and kept him there when
he had arrived. His dislike of approaching the Patriarch was so marked
that Wylie began to suspect that the tales he had heard of the secret
organisation of Greek bands in Emathia were true, and that the
Professor intended to employ them to rescue Maurice by force, thus
committing him to their cause, and them to his. But since the
Professor vouchsafed no account of his plans, Wylie could only proceed
with his own, which were not rendered easier of execution by the
reluctance of the Patriarch and his _entourage_ to do their part.
There could be little doubt that Scythian agents had been beforehand
with him, for it required weary days of waiting, and persistent
refusals to depart, before he could gain a sight of any one in
authority. By this time Professor Panagiotis seemed to have made up
his mind to work heartily with him, and they went together to the
Patriarchal palace, where they were received by a kind of domestic
chaplain, or clerical private secretary, a dark-robed, high-capped
monk with a keen, astute face. Having heard their request, the
secretary addressed himself to the Professor, apparently regarding him
as the more reasonable being of the two.

“If you realised the state of the community at Hadgi-Antoniou, you
would know that what you ask is impossible,” he said. “Since the first
Thracian monks were unfortunately admitted, under an agreement that
their number was never to exceed one-fourth of the whole, they have
steadily aimed at dominating the monastery. The agreement is still
nominally in force, but certainly half the brethren must be Thracian,
and in a year or two they will swamp the Greek element altogether. At
present the community remains faithful to the Patriarchate because the
Hegoumenos and other officials are Greeks, but should anything
precipitate a collision between the two bodies, it is almost certain
that they would be out-voted. To avoid such a collision is our
perpetual aim. How, then, can you expect us, for the sake of a couple
of unknown English tourists, to bring about the loss of an important
outpost?”

“You would wink at murder, if you might keep your monastery?” asked
Wylie. The monk shrugged his shoulders.

“Why don’t you apply to your Embassy?” he asked.

“Because we know that before any demand for the release of the
prisoners could be made effective, they would be carried away
somewhere else, or handed over to one of the brigand bands to be
murdered.”

“We are alike, then,” smiled the secretary. “You will not do what you
might, for fear of the consequences. Neither will we. There is no
question of any immediate danger to your friends, I believe? Why
trouble about them, then?”

Wylie rose angrily, but Professor Panagiotis laid a hand upon his
sleeve. “We have not taken into consideration the fact that the
prisoners are not unknown English tourists, but the heirs of the
blessed John Theophanis,” he said.

“The fact is curious, but no more,” said the secretary, with a wooden
face. “Living, as we do, under the tolerant and enlightened rule of
the Grand Seignior, survivals of the kind you mention have no interest
for us.”

“In certain eventualities, it might be inconvenient for the
Patriarchate if the heir of John Theophanis had a just cause of
resentment against it,” pursued the Professor.

“It is not for us to consider possible eventualities, but to maintain
truth and loyalty in the present,” was the answer, which filled Wylie
with helpless fury. The Professor remained calm.

“Very well: we will consider the present alone. The only other heir is
in the hands of the Scythians, pledged supporters of the schismatical
Exarchate. Is it or is it not a matter of importance that a nearer
heir should exist, attached by bonds of gratitude and affection to the
Patriarchate, and capable of being brought forward whenever Scythia
shows signs of asserting the claims of her candidate?”

“This sounds more businesslike,” said the secretary approvingly. “You
can answer for the young man’s strict Orthodoxy?”

“I have myself instructed him, and the experiences he has since
undergone at the hands of the schismatics can hardly have attracted
him to their cause. If the Patriarch intervened to rescue him, it
would bind the youth to him indissolubly.”

“The idea is good, but there are difficulties in the way of carrying
it out. To give you an order directing the release of the prisoners
would probably lead to their disappearance--we are surrounded by
spies--and would certainly lose us the monastery. It must be in
general terms. But even then you are too well known,” to the
Professor, “and I have been warned against this English gentleman,
your companion, so that he also will be watched for. You must find
some trustworthy agent, who may receive the Patriarchal letter, and do
your business by its aid.”

“Make it out in the name of Harold Armitage, an English painter, who
is commissioned to obtain views of the monastery for the Princess
Eirene Theophanis,” said Wylie.

“The Scythian candidate? You are ingenious, monsieur, to make the
devout purpose of the Princess contribute to her undoing. Well, the
letter shall be prepared, and all possible assistance desired for Mr
Armitage in his pious task. The rest of the business you must manage
for yourselves.”

He bowed them out, and as soon as they had crossed the threshold Wylie
expressed his candid opinion of the Patriarchal surroundings. The
Professor smiled grimly.

“When the Morean insurrection broke out, the Patriarch of the day was
hanged at his own church door,” he said. “We are not all ready to be
martyrs nowadays.”

Wylie said nothing, for the explanation was evidently all-sufficient
in the Professor’s eyes, but he wondered how much affection and
gratitude Maurice was expected to feel towards the Patriarchate, and
whether too much had not been promised in his name.

The Patriarchal letter arrived next day, its preparation having been
quickened by a discreet distribution of gifts among the persons
concerned, and Wylie was able to carry out his plans. The Professor
was to remain some days in Czarigrad, visiting the British Embassy
daily, and apparently devoting all his energies to obtaining the
release of the prisoners by its means, while Wylie took his departure
in a small fast sailing-vessel for Myriaki. The boat was chartered by
the Professor exclusively for this service, and Wylie suspected that
it was not the first time he had employed it on secret errands, so
knowing did the captain show himself with respect to ships and
customs-stations which it was advisable to avoid. Arriving off Myriaki
late one evening, Wylie, standing in the bows, raised and dipped a
light three times. The signal was answered from the shore, and
presently Armitage came off, brimming over with excitement.

“It’s all right,” he said. “You are my _cavass_, Spiridion Istriotis,
and I have brought you a suit of his clothes. The real Spiro is
remaining in the seclusion of the paternal mansion, on full wages,
until I send him word. You had better get the things on before coming
on shore, hadn’t you? Your cabin is large enough to allow of that,
though it certainly wouldn’t hold us both at once.”

“What about the passport?” demanded Wylie, as he made the change
rapidly in his little shelter under the half-deck, while Armitage
leaned against the bulkhead outside.

“Oh, that’s the greatest joke! The _teskereh_ they’ve given me would
apply to you, or your friend Smith, or any mortal man, just as well as
to me. I believe they keep a form in stock with the description of an
ideal Englishman--tall, fair hair, blue eyes, and so on--and simply
copy it. It will really fit you best, for the eyes will be right, at
any rate. What coloured eyes has Smith?”

“I don’t know--ordinary, I suppose,” growled Wylie, with whom the
point was a sore one.

“Well, it can’t be more unlike him than it is to me, so we ought all
to be able to use the same passport, if we can bribe the police to
look away while we pass it from one to the other. But you’ll go as
Spiro, of course, so you won’t want it. Ready? I sculled myself off,
to the great disapproval of the seafaring population on the quay,
because I had something I wanted to say without eavesdroppers.”

Wylie’s possessions were transferred to the boat, and he bade farewell
to the captain of the vessel, arranging with him to lie off Myriaki
for the next fortnight. In the boat he took the oars, and Armitage
pushed off. When they were about half-way to the shore, the artist
produced a small but weighty parcel contained in a chamois-leather
bag.

“Put that in the safest and best-hidden pocket you can find in Spiro’s
garments,” he said. “It has two hundred and fifty pounds in English
gold in it, and I have another just the same. I have scarcely dared to
sleep since I left Therma. The rest of my money is in notes and cash
of various fancy currencies peculiar to this delectable peninsula, and
is contained in an imposing cash-box, which all my servants have been
taught to regard with profound respect. But I thought it might be
desirable to have a secret store in an attractive form, and I’m
thankful to shift half the responsibility--and weight--off on you.”

“Good man!” said Wylie, concealing the bag inside his shirt, and
securing it with his girdle, and they rowed to the quay, where
Armitage was quartered in a villainous little Greek inn, having chosen
it that he might be able to keep watch for the vessel. He had allowed
it to become known that he was expecting the arrival of a special
messenger with a letter from the Patriarch to assist him in his work
at Hadgi-Antoniou, and Wylie was an object of intense veneration to
the Greeks of the port as he swaggered in front of Armitage, clearing
the way as the absent Spiro would have done. A number of the notables
of the place visited them after supper, anxious to enjoy the honour of
beholding the outside of the Patriarchal letter, and one or two of the
chief of them were allowed the supreme distinction of kissing it. In
the morning they escorted the letter and its bearers some distance on
their way, and parted from them the best of friends, amid much festive
firing of guns.

Armitage had neglected no precaution for ensuring the success of his
journey that the wisdom of many advisers in Therma could suggest to
him. The four men whom he called servants were really guards,
Mohammedan Illyrians, armed to the teeth, and faithful unto death
until the job for which they were engaged was over, after which they
would be quite ready to murder their late employer at the bidding of a
new one. Their presence ensured a friendly reception whenever Roumis
were met with, and the unofficial rulers of the country were
recognised by a letter to the principal brigand chief in the district,
who rejoiced in the name of Fido--a letter of safe-conduct obtained,
for a consideration, from Fido’s accredited agent in Therma. Armitage
had not ventured to make any preparations that might suggest his
intention of rescuing the prisoners, but he calculated that by the
time they reached Hadgi-Antoniou the stores would have diminished so
much that there would be a mule for Zoe to ride coming back, and he
had laid in a lavish provision of scented soap, handkerchiefs, and
other minor luxuries, ostensibly for his own benefit.

The journey proved to be uneventful, for such trifling incidents as
the frequent stopping of the cavalcade by bands of armed men could not
be considered events when the exhibition--with due discrimination--of
the Patriarchal letter, the brigand’s safe-conduct, or the Roumi
passport, according to circumstances, sufficed to close them. One of
Armitage’s precautions had been to provide a large store of
sugar-candy and other sweets, and the unfriendliness of the most
ferocious brigand or densest commissary of police was never proof
against a gift from it. The arrival at Hadgi-Antoniou was the close of
a triumphal progress, and Armitage and Wylie looked up at the
monastery on its pillar of rock, and wondered whether the rest of
their work was to be as easy.

The firing of the rifles of the escort brought the monks, as usual, to
their watch-tower, and questions and answers were bellowed up and down
the cliff. The news that the English lord was the bearer of a letter
from the Œcumenical Patriarch caused great excitement, and the net
was let down at once. Wylie went up in it, lest the monks should
refuse to admit him if Armitage went first. He was grabbed and hauled
in as the prisoners had been, and while he waited for his friend to
make the ascent he examined the tower and capstan with a keen eye.
Armitage having been landed, rather pale and uncomfortable-looking,
they were led first into the church, where the monks bowed to the
ikons and chanted with extreme rapidity a very brief service, which
might have been intended either as a welcome to the visitors or a
thanksgiving for their safe arrival. Wylie accepted it gratefully as
the latter. He was once more within a few yards of his friends, after
their long separation.

The old Hegoumenos, who had sent an apology for not welcoming the
strangers immediately, was awaiting them in the guest-room, with his
monks assembled round him. Armitage presented the Patriarch’s letter,
which the Hegoumenos kissed and laid to his forehead, and handed to
Papa Athanasios to read. The artist’s devout intention of painting
pictures of the monastery for the illustrious Princess who had so
lately been their guest was announced to the brethren with high
commendation, and after the letter had been handed round for them to
kiss, they retired. The last, and apparently the most reluctant to
quit the room, was a grey-bearded man with a look of authority, who
had been watching Wylie narrowly. When he had gone, a young and rather
foolish-looking monk came back furtively and peered at the visitors,
and they heard him saying something to his fellows outside. Papa
Athanasios looked annoyed, but he also cast an inquisitive glance at
Wylie.

“What are they saying?” asked Armitage.

“Oh, our younger brethren are foolish--they are like children,
unaccustomed to strangers--there is a silly saying among them----”
said the monk incoherently. “They do not often see any one like the
English lord’s _cavass_.”

“But what is the saying? Is it an old one?”

“No, not very--in fact, it is only a few weeks old. The Scythian lord
who came to escort the Princess to Therma bade one of our brethren
beware of the man with blue eyes, and they think they have found him.
But this is foolishness. The Lord Hegoumenos desires to know what else
he can do for you, since the sacred letter of the Universal Patriarch
orders him to pleasure you not only in your devout purpose, but in
other matters which you will confide to his ear.”

But when Armitage had asked for the release of the two English
prisoners, Papa Athanasios and the Hegoumenos looked at one another,
puzzled, timid, and anxious. Then they began to explain in low tones
that if it had depended on them, the prisoners would never have been
detained, but that M. Kirileff had arranged matters with Papa Demetri,
the treasurer of the monastery, and the only Thracian who had as yet
attained office. Papa Demetri was a most wonderful treasurer, his two
superiors confessed reluctantly; everything he touched seemed to turn
to gold, and the monastic revenues had never been so elastic. The
church was being entirely redecorated--this merely meant that the
frescoes and ikons were being painted over in exactly the same forms
and colours as before--and even the Greek brethren would support him
through thick and thin for making such a thing possible. The reason
for the wonderful advance of the Thracian element in the monastery was
now clear to the listeners, but they could not bring themselves to
point out to the two old monks that they were--however delicately the
transaction might be disguised--selling their nationality for Scythian
gold.

“Papa Demetri must be getting something out of Kirileff for this
business,” said Armitage to Wylie. “We must outbid him. Did the
Scythian traveller make any gift to the monastery?” he asked of Papa
Athanasios.

“He promised a very great gift, through Brother Demetri”--the monk
named a sum which worked out at about four hundred pounds. “The
brethren have all been rejoicing because it will restore the
_ikonostasis_, and complete the renewing of the church.”

“If he only promised it, whether it was through prudence or because he
hadn’t it with him, it’s a most lucky thing for us,” said Wylie.
“Offer them the five hundred down if they’ll give the prisoners up at
once.”

But this was much too summary a suggestion. The matter must be laid
before the monks in full conclave, it appeared, and they must choose
between five hundred pounds certain and a possible four hundred. Wylie
suggested that it might make the choice easier if they were not asked
actually to release the prisoners, but only to leave their cells
unlocked and unguarded, and the ladders on the face of the rock
available for use. The capstan he did not venture to advise, since no
one in the monastery could remain ignorant when it was being used. The
idea seemed to remove much of the two old men’s alarm, and the
Hegoumenos announced quite cheerfully that he would call a conclave
for the next day to consider the generous offer of the English lord.

“Can’t you show us where the prisoners are?” asked Wylie of Papa
Athanasios, as they paused in the courtyard, after leaving the
guest-room, to allow Armitage to make a hasty sketch of a corner of
the church. The old monk had already shepherded back the supposed
_cavass_, gently but firmly, from so many unauthorised excursions into
other buildings and courtyards, that he began to think M. Kirileff’s
warning not uncalled for, and he answered with some asperity--

“The lodging of the monastery’s guests is no concern of yours.”

“At least tell us how they are,” entreated Wylie, and Papa Athanasios
answered more gently--

“They are both in good health. I myself have allowed the youth to walk
in the courtyard at hours when Brother Demetri thought him safely
locked unto his cell, so eagerly did he entreat leave to smell the
air, and I have talked much with him at other times. The girl is left
to the charge of a devout woman, who has been much edified to behold
her continually rapt in contemplation, so that, had she been Orthodox,
she would have imagined her to be a seer of holy visions. One thing
perturbed our sister greatly--that her prisoner made many strange
signs on her wall with a nail, which she feared might be unholy
spells. So much was she troubled, that on a certain feast-day--was it
Holy Trinity or Holy John? I forget-- I allowed the girl also to walk
in the garden, and examined the marks for myself. But there was
nothing evil in them; they were such foolish and meaningless scrawls
as might be made by one distraught, and I quieted our sister’s mind
with this assurance.”

Armitage was laughing involuntarily, but to Wylie the thought of Zoe
enjoying a glimpse of liberty on Trinity Sunday, unconscious that her
scribbles were being scrutinised for evidences of witchcraft, was pure
pathos, and he turned away abruptly.




 CHAPTER XXI.
 “THERE’S MANY A SLIP----”

The conclave was held, and despite the strenuous efforts of Papa
Demetri, the monks decided by a large majority to accept Armitage’s
offer, and wink at the escape of the prisoners. Had M. Kirileff paid
down his two thousand five hundred roubles, the monastery would have
been bound in honour to fulfil his conditions, as the aged Papa
Apostolos pertinently observed, but since he had merely promised it,
and had not so far fulfilled his promise, it would be folly to refuse
an additional sum which would allow the silver-gilt haloes of the
saints on the _ikonostasis_ to be replaced by plates of pure gold.
And, after all, they were not asked to promote the prisoners’ escape;
it was merely a matter of leaving the ladders down for a few nights
instead of drawing them up, and of a temporary mislaying of his keys
by Papa Athanasios. It was also arranged--the suggestion came from
Brother Nikola, the vacuous-faced young monk who had identified
Wylie--that the escape should not take place until Armitage had
finished his picture of the church, lest the Princess Eirene should be
disappointed of her devout desires. The good news was carried by Papa
Athanasios to Armitage, who was diligently at work in the courtyard,
and he conveyed it to Wylie, whose indiscreet behaviour the day
before, coupled with M. Kirileff’s warning, had caused him to be
denied further admittance. He bore the monks no ill-will for his
exclusion, since Brother Evangelos, who was in charge of the ladders,
was authorised to show him how they were managed, and he spent the
afternoon of the day of the conclave in crawling up and down the
cliff-face like a fly on a wall. The next evening, however, when
Armitage descended in the net after a long day’s work, Wylie met him
and drew him aside from their camp.

“Those venerable frauds at the top there are up to some mischief,” he
said.

“How? what do you mean?” asked Armitage.

“Fellow came down the ladders this morning with a basket--apparently a
lay-brother going to the village for provisions. It struck me he
seemed to look about him a good deal, as if he was afraid of being
followed, so I promptly followed him, stalking him through the
brushwood on hands and knees. It was just as I expected. When he had
got well out of sight of our camp, he put down his basket, tucked up
his gown, and scampered off as hard as he could in the opposite
direction from the village. I tried to follow him, but as I didn’t
dare to stand upright he distanced me easily, so I took cover near his
basket to see when he came back. He was about an hour gone, then he
came and picked up his basket again, and went off to the village as
jauntily as you please.”

“But where do you think he went?”

“Clearly to some one who acts as go-between for Papa Demetri and the
Scythians--probably a brigand. The village is Greek, you see, so they
would have to look elsewhere. Of course, the plan is to fetch Kirileff
back with larger offers before we can get away. I distrusted that
stipulation about your finishing the picture, you know. When are you
likely to get it done?”

“Not for a good many years, if the monks are to be the judges. They
expect a regular Byzantine arrangement, showing every stone in the
walls and every tile that’s missing from the roof. They aren’t
educated up to modern methods, you see, and I’m putting as much detail
into it as I conscientiously can, just to please them. Still, with
another day’s work I ought to be able to produce a daub that will
pass, at any rate.”

“That’s all right. We couldn’t start to-night, anyhow. I am going up
the ladders when it’s dark, so as to know my way about them. I
couldn’t undertake to get Miss Smith down without. It’s a bad enough
climb to take a woman anyhow, and in the dark----! But perhaps that’s
just as well, since she won’t see what it’s like.”

“I wish I had your cool head. I suffer agonies every time I go up and
down in the net, even. By the bye, to avoid further artistic
controversy with the brethren, can you make a drawing, roughly to
scale, of the place for me to-morrow, from the ground, and jot down
the colours, so that I can paint from it afterwards? They’re so full
of the church that they haven’t remembered the outside view yet, but
Papa Demetri is quite capable of making use of it to delay us.”

“All right. It’ll be very rough, but that won’t signify. Meanwhile,
you tip the wink to Papa Athanasios to lose his keys before locking-up
time to-morrow night, will you?”

 * * * * * * *

Only one incident occurred to trouble the conspirators during the
following day, and this was a mishap to Brother Evangelos, who, in
passing through a dark passage, tripped over one of the crutches on
which the monks supported themselves during the long services, and
sprained his ankle so severely that he could not leave his cell. But
Wylie had ascended and descended the ladders safely during the night,
and was confident that he knew his way from one to the other, so that
there seemed no reason for delay. Papa Athanasios had warned Maurice
to be ready when the _semantron_ sounded for midnight service, and the
judicious gift of a rosary from the Holy Mountain had induced old
Marigo to convey the same message to Zoe. A dark robe and high cap,
such as were worn by the monks, had also been smuggled into the cell
of each, in case any belated brother, hurrying into church, should run
across the two strangers.

Wylie was half-way up the ladders when the clangour of the _semantron_
smote upon his ear, and he climbed the rest of the way in entire
forgetfulness of the perilous nature of his path. The sound was still
reverberating through the monastery when he reached the tower to which
the ladders led, and he could see the last-awakened among the monks
scurrying through the courtyard. Presently the noise died away, the
brother who had been wielding the mallet followed the rest into
church, and Wylie went softly across to the quarters of the Hegoumenos
and laid upon his divan the second packet containing two hundred and
fifty pounds, the first having been handed over as soon as the result
of the conclave was declared. Then he returned to the shelter of his
tower, and waited with beating heart, not daring to make his presence
known, even when two figures appeared round the end of the church, for
in the monkish garb it was impossible to distinguish who they were.
But they came unhesitatingly straight to the tower, and stepping out
from the doorway to meet them, he grasped a hand of each and led the
way to the ladder, sternly silencing their eager questions. Without
giving them time to consider the means by which they were to descend,
he went a few steps down, with his face to the ladder, then told Zoe
to follow him, and guided her feet to the steps, which were by no
means evenly placed. Maurice came last, well behind Zoe, that she
might have full liberty to cling to the sides of the ladder, and thus
they worked their way down, the cold sweat standing on Wylie’s brow.
The camp fire looked so small and so distant below--almost as distant
as the great clear stars, which seemed unnaturally bright in that
cloudless atmosphere. Had Maurice alone been in question, he would
have faced the adventure with a laugh, but that Zoe should be hanging
between heaven and earth on that rickety ladder, with the night-wind
whistling round her, was something unspeakably horrible. His feet
seemed like lead, and he could hardly feel the next rung as he moved
down to it, but Zoe distinguished no trembling as he guided her slowly
lower and lower. She followed his muttered directions as if in a
dream, for the imaginary world in which she had spent the greater part
of her captivity still lay about her, and it was as though her mind
received and her body obeyed his orders, while her real self was not
there at all.

At last they came to a ledge of rock, on which Wylie allowed a rest
from sheer necessity, for he found himself forced to cling to the
ladder even when standing on firm ground. But no sooner had Zoe’s feet
touched the rock than an exclamation from her turned his nerves to
iron again.

“What’s that?” she cried. “There’s some one here! Something high and
dark went round the corner.”

Neither Wylie nor Maurice, with their faces to the ladder, had seen
anything, but she had turned her head to see where Wylie was, and she
persisted that in that moment some one who had been standing close to
him had vanished. Peering round the corner, they could see nothing,
but Wylie drew a revolver as he led the way along the path which
formed the link between this ladder and the next. Still there was no
one to be seen, and he returned the weapon to his sash before stooping
to feel for the head of the ladder. All along the brink he groped
without success before the truth dawned upon him. The ladder was not
there. It was not a very long one, but it crossed slantwise a deep
chasm in the rock, which offered an insurmountable obstacle to any one
trying to ascend the cliff without it.

“The ladder is gone,” he said, turning to the other two, and hoping
that his voice did not betray his feelings. “We must let ourselves
down. Take off those monks’ gowns you have on. They will have to do
for ropes.”

They obeyed, and Wylie slit the long shapeless garments in two from
neck to hem with his dagger, then tied the halves together by their
huge sleeves, and the two gowns to one another. “I’ll go first,” he
said, “and you had better both hang on to the rope, for it’ll be a big
strain.”

They obeyed, not understanding how he meant to get across; but to
their horror, when he had let himself down over the edge, the rope
began to oscillate violently. He had fastened the end round his waist,
so as to leave his hands free, and he was doing his utmost to swing
across the chasm. Again and again his efforts fell short, and he swung
back bruised; but at last, with a wild clutch, he caught hold of the
bushes growing on the other side, and hauled himself up.

“Now, Miss Smith,” he said breathlessly, “recall your gym. days at
school. Do you think you can come down this rope hand over hand?”

Zoe would have died sooner than confess to inability or fear at that
moment, though the clumsy knotted cable had little resemblance to a
gymnasium-rope. “Rather!” she said promptly, and Wylie twisted the end
he held round and round, so as to make the bridge as strong as
possible. Sliding down it was out of the question, on account of the
knots, and she saw that she must work her way along. Maurice put his
end of the rope under the largest stone he could find, as an added
security against slipping, then, bracing himself firmly, held it as
taut as he could. Zoe gripped it with hands and feet, thankful for the
flexible moccasins, which were so much more serviceable than shoes,
and dropped slowly from knot to knot, descending diagonally until
Wylie, standing on his end of the rope, was able to catch her in his
arms. She stood aside, panting, while he asked Maurice whether the
stone was large enough to balance his weight.

“Nothing like,” was the reply. “I shall jump. In case I miss, I shall
tie the rope round my waist, and you must pull me up. Zoe had better
hold on to it as well, for fear the jerk might drag you over. Stand
clear.”

Wylie and Zoe stood well back, and waited for the shock, but Maurice
had judged his distance so well that though he did not land on the
rock where they were standing, he was able to grasp the bushes which
grew below it, and before they could give way, Wylie had him by the
hand. The bushes afforded sufficient foothold to enable him to raise
himself over the edge of the rock, and winding the rope round him in
case it should be needed again, he followed the other two to the head
of the next ladder. This was duly in place, and they began to descend
it in the same order as before, but about midway Wylie’s heart stood
still. What if the unknown enemy who had removed the second ladder
should have sawn through the supports of this one? He said nothing to
his friends, and they went on steadily until they reached the foot of
this ladder, and passed through a hole cut in the rock to the head of
a fourth. This also was passed in safety, and they stood on a rocky
platform, extending some way into the rock in the form of a cave. This
was only some hundred and fifty feet above the ground, and the
rope-ladder was hanging from its two iron stanchions ready for their
descent.

“I say,” said Maurice, “I don’t like the look of this cave. We can’t
very well search it without a light, for any one hiding in it could
see us against the stars, but if Zoe’s phantom is there, he might
think it rather a good dodge to cut the ladder while we were all on
it. You take Zoe down first, Wylie, and I’ll stay on guard until you
are safe down.”

“All right,” said Wylie. “Take my revolver, and don’t hesitate to
shoot. I wonder if Armitage is down below?”

He whistled softly, and an answering whistle came up, while the limp,
dangling ladder became firm. Once again Zoe was thankful for her
moccasins, for it was much more nervous work descending the loose
rungs of rope than those of the wooden ladders. Wylie guided her feet
as before, and slowly and steadily they came nearer to the darkness
which meant firm ground. She had kept up valiantly hitherto, but when
it came to the last step she could not induce herself to take it. She
seemed to have been crawling down shaking ladders for unnumbered
hours, and she clung shivering to the ropes, utterly unable to quit
her hold. Wylie unclasped her hands gently at last, and lifted her
down, saying, in a commonplace, society voice which dried up her
threatening tears, “I want to introduce my friend Armitage, Miss
Smith. You have to thank him for getting you out, for he wasn’t
suspected as I was.”

“Awfully glad to see you safe on firm ground,” said Armitage. “I’m
afraid you’ll find things rather rough, but if you’ll kindly put up
with it----”

“We should like to have brought a whole outfit, and a lady’s-maid, and
all sorts of Eastern luxuries for you,” said Wylie, who was holding
the ladder steady for Maurice to descend; “but we were afraid of
rousing suspicion. As your sister--I mean Princess Eirene--isn’t here,
may I say that you must think you are on active service?”

Zoe had been laughing rather nervously, but the question roused her to
recollection. “Oh,” she cried, “have you brought me any note-books?”

“No, really, I’m afraid not,” said Wylie, dismayed. “Why?”

“Oh, I have been living the most splendid story all the time I have
been in the monastery, and I wanted to write it down before I forget.
I know it will all fade when I get with other people.”

Her tone spoke of such complete absorption in the story that Wylie was
conscious of a jealous feeling that the absence of the note-books was
not an unmixed misfortune.

“I’m awfully sorry,” he said hypocritically. “We’ll bring you
cartloads of note-books as soon as we get to Th----”

An exclamation from Armitage broke into his sentence. Above, on the
edge of the rocky platform, a high cap and a bearded face were
momentarily outlined against the starry sky, and something shining
caught the light. One side of the ladder seemed to drop, and the rungs
hung drooping. Wylie felt for his revolver, but it was in Maurice’s
sash as he clung half-way down the ladder, and before Armitage could
thrust his into his hand, the remaining side-rope parted with a sound
like the report of a gun, and Maurice seemed to fly outwards through
the air. He came to the ground with a thud which drew an agonised
shriek from Zoe, and Wylie scarcely doubted that he must be killed. He
was unconscious when they reached him, but as they were anxiously
feeling his limbs, he opened his eyes for a moment.

“Broken, I think,” he said, as Armitage touched his right arm, and
Wylie confirmed the opinion.

“Well, better than a leg,” said Maurice feebly. “You’d have had to
leave me here if it had been that.”

“Nonsense, we’d have rigged you up a cacolet, and carried you on a
baggage-mule,” said Wylie, examining into the extent of the injury by
the light of the vestas which Armitage struck. “You may think yourself
jolly lucky if this is all that’s wrong with you, Smith. I can
manufacture some splints and strap it up, but if it had been an elbow,
or a compound fracture of any sort, it would have been beyond me. Now,
can you get to the camp if we help you along?”

Maurice set his teeth, and submitted to be helped up and supported as
far as the tents, where Zoe, much to her indignation, was ruthlessly
ordered to rest for an hour or so, on the ground of having gone
through quite enough already. In vain she recalled her possession of
First Aid certificates, Wylie was adamant, and even the ungrateful
Maurice entreated her to go and lie down and not make a fuss. When she
was called, in the early morning, the arm was set, and Maurice, though
pale and in considerable pain, was quite ready to start. Wylie gave up
his horse to him and walked at his side, and Zoe was mounted, as had
been arranged, on the mule. What the guards thought of the additions
to the party no one knew, for they asked no questions and made no
remarks, and all went smoothly. There was one disagreeable moment
during the day, when a peripatetic police official, travelling with an
escort, was encountered. He accepted with enthusiasm the assurance
that Maurice and Zoe were the two famous Europeans whose capture and
detention by brigands had produced such a stir, and immediately
afterwards declared his intention of arresting them for travelling in
the interior of the country without a passport. Asked what he intended
to do with them, he replied that it was his duty to conduct them
immediately to the nearest port, whereupon he was assured that they
were going thither as fast as they could. To this he rejoined that he
felt it right to escort them there, and as his room, and that of his
ragged regiment, was infinitely to be preferred to his company, it was
clear that an attempt must be made to overcome his sense of duty. The
means of doing this was simple, but expensive, and to the last it was
doubtful whether his affection for the travellers would not lead him
to attach himself to them as long as they had anything left that
commended itself to his fancy. They succeeded in freeing themselves
from him, however, and the rest of the return journey was as
uneventful as that from the coast had been. Maurice bore the
travelling well, and he and Zoe took unfeigned delight in the open-air
life after four weeks within stone walls.

The only person who was not satisfied was Wylie. He had accomplished
the object to which all his efforts had been bent, he had the society
of his friends again, but the reality was not equal to the
anticipation. Zoe and he were not close comrades, as they had been in
the early days of their captivity. Sometimes he tried to look at the
fact from a common-sense point of view, deciding that Maurice’s
accident was enough to account for the change, but at other times he
told himself bitterly that it was all his own fault for forgetting the
note-books. Of course, Zoe must think that he was utterly and wilfully
indifferent to the things that interested her. It was so unfair, too,
for though, like most men of his type, he had little fancy for any
woman with whom he had to do “mixing herself up with writing,” he was
sure that Zoe could not have discovered this. He had acquiesced in the
jesting, matter-of-fact way in which she chose to allude to her
literary efforts, and had even congratulated himself that the taste
could not be very deep-rooted. And now this wretched story of hers was
coming between them, he was sure of it. When she rode for an hour in
silence, and had to be recalled to her present surroundings with a
start, he knew she was living in that world of hers in which he had no
part. It did not affect his feelings towards her. If she chose to
write novels all day and every day, he would accept the fact, and
prize the results, however little he could enter into them, because
they were hers, but the sense of aloofness came from her side. As she
had put it to herself after their parting in the forest, she had been
learning to do without him, and with her mind preoccupied with her
story, she had found it easy.




 CHAPTER XXII.
 UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS.

“I am so dreadfully worried about Maurice,” said Zoe, meeting Wylie
in the courtyard of the Professor’s villa at Kallimeri, to which they
had come immediately on reaching Therma by sea from Myriaki.

“Why, is the arm worse? I thought that Greek doctor was too
complimentary to my surgery. Shall I ride in and find a European
surgeon and bring him out?”

“No, I don’t think it’s that. I can’t help fancying Maurice must have
got a touch of fever the night we lay off the harbour. He is worrying
about Eirene, and says that he feels she’s in some great danger. That
sort of thing is so unlike Maurice--thought-transference and things of
that kind, I mean--and I think he must be ill. He talks of going into
Therma himself and insisting on seeing her, and you know the doctor
said he was to keep perfectly quiet. I suppose they may be carrying
Eirene off to Scythia, but I don’t see how he knows about it. At any
rate I’m sure he’s not fit to go and contend with all the obstacles
they would put in his way at the Scythian Consulate.”

“Well, I’m not exactly a favoured visitor there myself, and it’s
pretty clear that Armitage isn’t either, since they have sent back his
pictures without even undoing them.”

“Oh, I hadn’t heard that,” said Zoe.

“They arrived this morning, with a note from Mme. Ladoguin to say that
the duplicity of Armitage’s behaviour since his audience of her had so
shocked the Princess that she considered herself released from any
obligation to him. They have found out what happened at
Hadgi-Antoniou, you see. I suppose Papa Demetri’s messenger got
through just too late for them to stop us.”

“I wonder if it would be any good my going?” mused Zoe. “I scarcely
like leaving Maurice for a whole day, but----”

“You musn’t think of it. You don’t imagine that if they let you in it
would be for any good? The next thing we should find out would be that
you were smuggled away to Scythia, and we should have to begin the
hunt all over again.”

Zoe laughed. “Perhaps if I wrote a note to Eirene, they would let her
answer it,” she said. “I suppose Maurice would be satisfied if he knew
she was well, and not utterly miserable. You don’t think she has
started already, do you?”

“There was nothing of that kind in the note, and they could just as
well have said that the pictures had arrived too late, if they wanted
to snub Armitage. Well, shall I ride in with the note, and do my best
to get it into the Princess’s hands? More I can’t promise, but it’s
just possible that they won’t be looking out for me now, and I may
manage to see her.”

“I don’t like giving you so much trouble----”

“It’s no trouble. In fact, I must have gone in to-day or to-morrow to
report to Sir Frank Francis, who has done what he could for us all
along, in a blundering, slow-coach, civilian sort of way. He’s a good
old chap. The Professor has been talking of going in too, to see the
Vali. He believes he’s on the track of a Thraco-Dardanian conspiracy
to destroy all the Greek and Roumis in Emathia at one fell swoop, so
he’s naturally excited, and thinks he’ll make the Vali so too.” Wylie
spoke lightly, for his pride had imposed upon him the expediency of
treating Zoe as she treated him. If she did not care to remember the
days in which they had faced death and hardship together, he was quite
willing to behave as a mere ordinary acquaintance. He would serve her
in any possible way--that much his love for her demanded of him--but
he would not court rebuff by exhibiting his feelings. The natural
result of this course of conduct was that Zoe, missing something in
his manner which she liked, while objecting to what it implied, began
to make delicate experiments for the purpose of ascertaining how far
she could go. She declined now to be drawn aside from the topic she
had started.

“It doesn’t seem fair that you should always be running errands for
us. We seem to have annexed you altogether. How is it you haven’t had
to go back to India yet?”

“Got an extension of leave,” said Wylie, unmoved. “Always glad to make
myself useful when I can, you know. Well, if you will write that note,
I’ll find out whether the Professor is going into town, and go without
him if he isn’t. I should think we shall spend the night at his house,
and come out to-morrow, which will give me a little more time to
besiege the Princess.”

“I don’t know how I shall keep Maurice quiet all day,” sighed Zoe.

“Oh, he’ll be all right when he knows some one is trying to see her.
Are you going to ask her to come out?”

“Oh, not in the note. They would never let it reach her. But if you
see her, you might suggest that she should spend a day here. The
Professor knew her father, you know. Of course, Madame Ladoguin must
come too, but I’ll manage her.”

“You will be the first person that ever did that,” said Wylie, as he
went off to find his host.

Professor Panagiotis was quite willing to accept him as a companion,
and they rode off early in the afternoon. At the Professor’s house in
the town they separated, the Professor going to the Konak to seek an
interview with the Roumi Governor, and Wylie to the British Consulate.
Sir Frank was busy, but asked him to come to dinner that evening and
tell his story afterwards, and he went on at once to the Scythian
Consulate, where the comedy of which he had formerly grown so tired
recommenced. Servant after servant poured forth floods of eloquence in
the attempt to convince him that the Princess was indisposed, that she
received no one, that she was out driving, that she was preparing for
her journey to Scythia, that he might safely leave the note to be
delivered to her. This Wylie declined, and asked for an interview with
Madame Ladoguin, which was denied him, and he put the note back into
his pocket, and took up his old position opposite the Consulate. Here
he remained until it was very nearly dark, without seeing the ladies
return, so that it became pretty clear that one of the excuses, at any
rate, was false. He quitted his post reluctantly, and finding that he
had barely left himself sufficient time to go back and dress for
dinner, called a cab to take him to the Professor’s house.

He had scarcely departed when the great gates were thrown open, and
Madame Ladoguin and Eirene drove out. They were going to dine at the
Hercynian Consulate, one of the “safe” houses where there was no fear
of meeting any meddling English people. Even in cases like this,
however, Madame Ladoguin insisted on the list of guests being
submitted to her beforehand, representing that the Princess was very
strict on such points of etiquette, and refused to waive them even
when paying visits, as at present, under a partial _incognito_. There
was a cloud on Madame Ladoguin’s brow. Wylie’s unexpected reappearance
had much perturbed her, and she scented a deep-laid scheme for
carrying off Eirene before she could be safely removed to Scythia. She
had sent anxious messages to her husband and brother to ask them to
come to her before starting, but M. Ladoguin had been out all the
afternoon, discussing with his fellow-Consuls the alarming rumours
which were prevalent in the town of impending revolutionary movements,
and Nicetas Mitsopoulo was still away on one of his mysterious
errands. As a last resource, Madame Ladoguin ordered her coachman to
stop at a club much frequented by the European representatives, in the
hope of finding her husband there, intending to send him to complain
to Sir Frank Francis that his troublesome fellow-countryman was
renewing his intolerable persecution of the Princess.

M. Ladoguin was at the club, but his wife would not have him summoned
to speak to her. Apologising to Eirene, she left the victoria and went
into the hall, where her charge could not hear what was said. Eirene,
left alone, looked out indifferently down the brightly lighted street.
Here, in the European quarter, thanks to the efforts of the consular
body, paving and lighting conformed to Western rather than Eastern
standards. Next door to the club towered the dark bulk of a building,
which she knew to be the Seignorial Bank, now closed for the night,
but something moving on its steps attracted her attention. It was
difficult to see what it was in the shadow, but she thought that a
porter must be laying down his burden there while he rested. At this
moment her thoughts were distracted by a cab, which drove up
furiously, its wheels almost grazing those of the carriage, and by the
bad language which ensued between the driver and the consular
_cavass_. Then--it all happened in a moment--the houses seemed to
reel, she was thrown violently forward, and the air was filled with
the sound of a tremendous explosion. The frightened horses went off
like the wind, further terrified by the crash of falling fragments of
masonry which came hurtling through the air. Eirene crouched dazed at
the bottom of the carriage, face and shoulders cut and bruised by the
stony shower. The sound of fresh explosions showed her that she was
not deafened, but she could not hear the coachman’s voice calling to
his horses, and guessed that he had been thrown from the box. At the
same moment she became aware that she was in pitch darkness. Her first
horrified thought was that she had been struck blind, but as she
looked up through the tattered hood of the carriage she saw a jet of
flame soar into the sky, and realised that whoever had caused the
explosions must also have cut off the gas supply of the town. The
horses had now turned out of the foreign quarter into one of the
native streets, as she could tell by the way the carriage swayed and
bumped over the cobbles, and it was a marvel to her that it was not
every moment upset, as the wheels now collided with a post and now
grazed a projecting shop-front.

The air was full of shrieks and cries, still punctuated by an
occasional explosion, and there was a distant sound which she thought
must be firing. Sitting helpless, as the maddened horses tore along,
she analysed probabilities with a calmness that surprised herself, and
wondered whether the wild race would end in the waters of the harbour
or in one comprehensive smash. Then there happened something that
struck her with greater horror than all that had gone before. She had
raised herself to the front seat, and kneeling, was trying to look out
ahead to see where she was going, when a black figure gained the box
with a mad spring, and seizing the whip, lashed the horses on. By the
glare in the sky she could see that it wore the high cap and flowing
robes of a monk, with unkempt hair and beard. They dashed on into
another street, which Eirene had a vague idea belonged to the Moslem
quarter, and peering out she saw a dark mass of people in front. She
shrieked to them to stop the horses, but they did not understand, and
scattered to let the carriage through. This brought it opposite a
large building, and the man on the box, dropping the whip, stood
upright and hurled something with all his strength. The explosion that
followed was no surprise to Eirene; it seemed to her that she waited
for the sound. The building appeared to crumple up, and the horses
sprang forward again with a jerk, which threw the monk from the box;
but a minaret at the side fell across the street, and they could not
face the ruin which came crashing down. Driven on by the shouts from
behind, they dashed at the obstacle formed by the heap, turned when
they found themselves thwarted, and dragged the carriage violently
round, with one wheel high on the stones. Eirene had just sufficient
presence of mind to spring clear as it went over, and to crouch
against the houses on one side while the horses kicked and struggled
furiously to free themselves. One succeeded, and rushed wildly down
the street, but the other, which had fallen and was entangled in the
harness, tried in vain to raise itself from the ground.

Seeing that the danger was past, the people behind came running up,
and Eirene found herself dragged from her shelter. The monk had
disappeared, and, to her horror, she perceived that the mob evidently
took her for the person who had destroyed their mosque. They were all
Moslems, armed with knives and daggers, and they poured blood-curdling
imprecations upon her as she stood surrounded by a ring of steel. In
every language she knew she entreated them to take her back to the
Consulate, or merely to let her go, but no one would listen, or seemed
to understand. She tore off her rings and the diamond stars from her
hair and threw them among them, then her pearl necklace--not the
historic necklace which had been given up to the brigands, but a less
valuable one which had been sent on into safety in the jewel-case
after the railway accident. The string snapped as she pulled it off,
and she caught the pearls in her hands and offered them to the mob if
they would let her go, but in vain. They forced her hands open, and
fought for the pearls, but never so eagerly as to leave a gap by which
she could escape. She would have given even the girdle of Isidora as
the price of her life if she had had it with her, but it was reposing
safely at the Consulate.

After the first moment it gave her no comfort that she was not cut to
pieces at once, for she guessed from the gestures of her assailants
that while some of them advocated this course, others were proposing
to take her into one of the houses and torture her in order to
discover her accomplices. In another moment she must have fainted from
sheer horror, when the prostrate horse, which every one had forgotten,
created a diversion by struggling to its feet and lashing out
furiously, clearing a space round it. Seeing her chance, she tore
herself from the men who held her, leaving her cloak in their hands,
and sprang up the heap of rubbish which blocked the road. She could
never have crossed it in cold blood, for the foothold was insecure,
and the projecting pieces of rough stone and jagged wood caught her
clothes and tore her hands; but she descended like a thunderbolt into
a second crowd which had collected on the farther side, and burst
through them before they could understand the agonised shouts which
reached them from her defrauded captors.

Gathering her long skirt over her arm that it might not impede her
movements, she ran headlong down the street, slipping on the horrible
cobbles. Very soon she heard the hue and cry after her, and knew she
must quickly be overtaken, for her high-heeled shoes caught in the
treacherous interstices between the stones and nearly threw her down.
Passing the mouth of another street, a desperate expedient suggested
itself. The door of the first house stood open, and she slipped
inside, hearing her pursuers rage by. As soon as the last was past the
door, she crept out, and ran down the side street, more slowly now,
for one shoe had lost its heel, and she could only get on with
difficulty. Before she reached the end of the street she heard the
shouts of the mob growing nearer again, and knew that they must have
discovered her evasion. Two narrow passages between overhanging houses
were before her, and she darted down the nearest, which was unsavoury
to a degree. It ended at last, and she came out on a wide open space,
surrounded by squalid hovels, the outlines of which were just
discernible by the dull glare in the sky. Panting, she paused for a
moment, took off the shoe which still possessed a heel, and tried
vainly to hammer it off with a stone. It was beyond her efforts, and
she pushed back her hair, tied her handkerchief across her face below
the eyes, so that it hung down like an Egyptian face-veil, and turned
the skirt of her evening gown over her head, hoping that she might
pass for a Roumi woman, whose veil would be a safeguard to her in the
event of meeting any Moslem. Happily for her peace of mind, it did not
occur to her that the frills of silk and lace at the edge of the
lining would betray her at once, and she began to limp across the open
space, which she recognised as the remains of a Roman amphitheatre
which forms one of the sights of Therma.

She had scarcely emerged from the shadow of the houses when she heard
footsteps behind her. She stopped, but they came on, and she broke
into a feeble run, hearing the footsteps following and coming nearer.
She thought she heard a voice, but she drew the skirt more closely
over her head and tottered on, until the treacherous heel caught in
something and she fell. The footsteps approached at a run, and she
shut her eyes and waited for death.

“I’m awfully sorry I frightened you,” said a voice in English. “Can I
help you in any way?”

The revulsion of feeling was so great that Eirene crouched helplessly
where she had fallen, and looked up at her questioner. With a gasp of
relief, such as she had never expected to feel in the circumstances,
she recognised the blue eyes bent upon her.

“Oh, Captain Wylie!” she sobbed.

“Why, who is it?” he asked, helping her up. “Is it possible--not Miss
Eirene?--I mean the Princess.”

“Oh, yes,” she cried, pulling off the handkerchief; “and there is a
crowd trying to kill me, and I can’t get away. Oh, what shall I do?”

“Gently,” said Wylie, drawing her back into the shadow of the houses.
“Are you hurt? You seemed to walk lame.”

“It’s my shoes. I have only one heel left.” She took off the shoe, and
he amputated the offending heel with his knife.

“I can’t promise to get you back to the Consulate,” he said, steering
her across the corner of the open space, “for most of the outrages
have taken place in the foreign quarter, and the troops are out, and
firing wild. I like the Roumis generally, but to-night I must confess
I would as soon meet a mob as soldiers. It’s natural enough after what
has happened.”

“But what has happened?” cried Eirene. “Did some one blow up the
Seignorial Bank?”

“Yes, and a good many other places as well. I gave up trying to count
the explosions at last. I am staying with Professor Panagiotis, and
was driving back to his house when the first explosion came and the
gas failed. My driver refused to take me any farther, saying the
Professor’s house would certainly be one of those blown up. I tried to
get there the nearest way on foot, but there were troops pursuing
imaginary revolutionists in all the foreign streets, and too many
bullets were flying about for the atmosphere to be healthy.”

“But are we going to the Professor’s house now? What is the good, if
it’s blown up?”

“I have no reason to think that it is. As far as I can see, the
outrages have been mostly directed against foreign buildings. I
suppose the malcontents are displaying their disgust and contempt for
the reforms forced on the Grand Seignior by the Powers. At any rate,
as the Professor’s guest, I should be more likely to find shelter in
the Greek quarter than elsewhere.”

“But why do you say the troops are shooting imaginary revolutionists?
Who do you think threw the bombs? There was a monk who jumped up on
the carriage--oh, it was terrible!”

“Agents of the Thraco-Dardanian Committees, certainly, but I don’t
think they will wait to be shot. They will have provided for their
escape, and it’s only poor wretched passers-by, who have nothing to do
with the outrages, and are too terrified to get away, that will suffer
in this moment of panic.”

“But how can I go to the Professor’s?” asked Eirene, her thoughts
returning to her own situation, as, clinging to Wylie’s arm, she
traversed the deserted streets.

“Well, I should think it was better than staying out of doors,”
returned Wylie grimly. “I shall be thankful if we can get there.”

There was a significance in his tone which she did not at first
understand, for his trained ear had caught sooner than she did the
regular tramp of soldiers, disentangling it from the confusion of
sounds which still filled the air--not close at hand, for the
shuttered houses might have been the abodes of the dead, but coming
from the quarter they were approaching. Reaching the corner of a
street, Wylie peered round it cautiously, and drew Eirene back with an
exclamation.

“There’s a detachment of the troops who are clearing the streets
coming this way. There! they’ve got some poor devil,” as the sound of
a volley and a piercing shriek rent the air. “Stand in this doorway.
They may go straight on and not see us.”

Eirene shrank as far into the shelter of the doorway as she could, and
Wylie stood in front of her, concealing her as much as possible.

“They’ve got the jumps badly, and are firing at everything they see.
That’s the worst of it,” he said over his shoulder. “If I go down, you
must try to make them understand what an enormity they’ve committed in
firing on a European, and invoke Sir Frank Francis till all is blue.”




 CHAPTER XXIII.
 A FUSION OF INTERESTS.

The soldiers came down the street talking loudly and excitedly, for
the bonds of discipline were evidently relaxed. Every now and then a
stray shot told that one of them thought he had seen a figure lurking
in the shadow, and was taking the surest way of making things safe.
The fitful beams of an old and inefficient lantern wavered from side
to side as the leading man swung it towards each doorway in turn, but
the light was so feeble that Wylie, standing rigid in his corner,
almost hoped not to be seen. But his tweed clothes stood out against
the dark and greasy stonework of the porch, and as the beam fluttered
over him a voice called, “There’s a man hiding in that door!”
Instantly the ready rifles were focussed upon him, and even before he
could step forward two or three random shots struck the stonework and
spattered up the dust at his feet, but these were only due to nervous
men with twitching fingers. Before the order could be given to fire,
his voice rang out, “Cease firing!” in Roumi, and, taken by surprise,
the soldiers obeyed. He seized his opportunity, and called out that he
was English, and demanded their protection as far as the British
Consulate.

“Why, it is a dog of a Christian, after all!” said one.

“If he did not throw the bombs, he stirred up the rascals to do it,”
said another.

“And what is he doing here, anyhow?” demanded a third.

“Discovered under suspicious circumstances,” growled the sergeant. “He
can’t do any harm dead.”

“He can do you a lot of harm when his body is found, you old fool!”
said Wylie vigorously. The sergeant jumped.

“Here! give me the lantern,” he said, and taking it from the man who
held it, swung it so that the light fell on Wylie’s face. “Why, it is
the Bimbashi Bey with the cruel eyes, who gave us cigarettes when we
were up in the north three months ago!” he cried. “He is a good man,
Christian or not. Let there be no more talk of shooting him. What does
the Bimbashi Bey desire?”

“Can you get us to the Consulate?” asked Wylie, moving aside. The
men’s eyes grew round as they distinguished Eirene crouching in the
shadow behind him.

“It will be very difficult to take the lady such a long way through
the streets,” mused the sergeant. “Has the Bimbashi Bey no friends in
the Greek quarter?”

“I am staying with Professor Panagiotis,” said Wylie.

“Oh, the chief of the Greeks! That is well, unless his house is one of
those destroyed. We can soon see.”

The soldiers opened out, and Wylie and Eirene took their places in the
midst. The sergeant, stalking just ahead, conversed with Wylie over
his shoulder. Ever since their meeting in the north, he and his men
had been sent hither and thither to places where outbreaks were
expected, but the outbreaks always occurred in the districts they had
just left, or, as now, had been allowed to come to a head instead of
being nipped in the bud. Every one had been expecting this particular
outbreak for days, or even weeks, he declared. It might have been
entirely prevented, but some one must have been heavily bribed.
Undoubtedly it was all due to the representatives of the Powers, who
with one hand egged on the revolutionists to their outrages, and with
the other held back the Roumis from punishing them as they deserved.

Argument of this kind did not admit of much reply, and Wylie attempted
no defence of the action of the Powers, which had certainly not been
marked by any particular success. They were now in the Greek quarter,
and scared faces peeped at them from upper windows, while every door
was fast shut. Arrived at the end of the street in which Professor
Panagiotis lived, they found a cordon of soldiers drawn across it,
guarding a carriage which was waiting ready to start. About the middle
of the street, a gap in the row of houses dark against the sky showed
where the Professor’s dwelling had stood. The sergeant questioned his
colleague in charge of the guard, and found that they had been
detailed by the Vali to escort the Professor home, as his life was
considered to be in danger, but on arriving they discovered from the
neighbours that the house had been destroyed almost simultaneously
with the first explosion--that at the Seignorial Bank. The Professor
was now examining the ruins, to see whether any of his property could
be saved, but in a few minutes he was to be escorted to the city gate,
and set safely on his way to Kallimeri.

“This is most fortunate,” said Wylie to Eirene. “I will make bold to
offer you the shelter of the Professor’s villa instead of his house
here, and you will meet the Teffanys again. They are longing to see
you.”

“Teffany? Oh, you mean Maurice and Zoe. I always think of them as
Smith. I should rejoice to meet them again, but not--not like this.”
Eirene looked down at her torn clothes and ruined shoes. “It would not
be proper--becoming. We are not now in the mountains.”

Wylie laughed involuntarily. “They must have seen you in much worse
trim often in the mountains,” he said. “Why is it improper now, if it
wasn’t then?”

“The circumstances are different,” she said, flushing. “They know now
who I am. I cannot thrust myself upon them and ask help. At least we
were all in the same plight in the mountains.”

“I can relieve your mind on one point, at any rate. There’s no
question of thrusting yourself upon them, for they are most anxious to
see you. I have a letter from Miss Teffany for you here, if you can
see to read it, and I was charged in addition to use all the arts of
diplomacy to persuade you to visit Kallimeri, if only for a day, and
even if you had to be accompanied by Madame Ladoguin.”

“You really mean it?” she asked, looking up at him doubtfully. “You
are not saying it merely to make me willing to come? You may not quite
understand, but it is a tremendous step for me to take. I mean, if the
Ladoguins choose, they may say--things about me, and I may be cast off
entirely--if I don’t go back to the Consulate at once, you know.”

Wylie cut short her halting utterances. “Don’t be afraid,” he said
kindly. “You shall go back to the Consulate as early as you like
to-morrow. To-night you simply can’t get there. Slander itself could
say nothing against your accepting a night’s shelter from your
father’s old friend and his wife. Now, will you get into the carriage
and read your letter, while I go and look for the Professor? You will
promise me to wait here until I come back?”

Much to his relief, Eirene uttered no protest, and the idea which had
occurred to him that she might slip away when his back was turned, and
lose herself in the mazes and dangers of the streets, had evidently
not entered her mind. She was too much exhausted by all she had
undergone to have energy left to make plans for herself, and it was an
untold relief to find her movements settled for her. Gratefully she
accepted Wylie’s help, and entered the carriage, receiving Zoe’s
letter from him with a word of thanks, and leaning forward eagerly to
read it by the light of the sergeant’s lantern. Her piteous little
white face, as she looked up at him in utter bewilderment of fatigue,
was in Wylie’s thoughts as he passed the cordon to find the Professor,
and it made him very determined to obtain success in a task which he
foresaw, though without exactly knowing why, would have its
difficulties. He met the Professor returning to the carriage, and
condoled with him on his losses.

“Oh, it was only to be expected,” was the philosophical reply. “It
would have been something of a slight if I had been left unmolested on
such an occasion. Of course, the miscreants hoped to benefit
themselves,--I hear there were a dozen Jews raking over the ruins
almost before the fire had ceased, under pretence of helping to save
my possessions,--but I need not tell you they found nothing. We shall
save nothing of the furniture or contents of the house, unfortunately;
the destruction was too thorough. Two or three bombs must have been
used, I should say, and remarkably well placed. The caretaker’s wife,
who escaped, tells me she noticed a very tall woman, whom she
suspected to be a man in disguise, hanging about just at dusk. Well,
we had better get back to Kallimeri. I am sorry it is no use looking
for your bag, if that was your reason for coming down here.”

“Never once thought of it,” said Wylie, detaining him. “No, I have
picked up a European lady in distress, and I want to take her back
with us. There’s nothing else to be done.”

“Who is the lady?” asked the Professor sharply.

“The Princess Eirene Féofan.”

“I suspected as much. No; let her go back to the Scythian Consulate. I
have no responsibility for her.”

“She can’t. The streets are impassable. You knew her father; you can’t
refuse her shelter.”

“I will have nothing to do with her. Do you realise that she is a
Scythian tool, the only person whose right to the Greek Imperial crown
approaches--in some eyes even overshadows--that of Maurice Teffany?
Let Scythia look after her own candidate; my interests are
diametrically opposed to hers.”

“Professor,” said Wylie, a bright idea seizing him, and enabling him
to choke down his indignation, “you can’t deceive me. Don’t try to
tell me that the same thought isn’t in your head as in mine. The game
is in your hands, and it’s no use trying to persuade me that you think
of throwing away your advantage. If you can get the Princess to
Kallimeri, and marry her to Teffany, you and he are both made men.”

The Professor drew in his breath with a hissing sound. “He might be,”
he said. “I should be left out.”

“Oh, nonsense! when both of them would owe you a debt of gratitude
ever after for having brought them together? Why, it would give you
the strongest possible influence at once.”

The Professor considered the matter, and it was evident to Wylie that
he was weighing the merits of various courses in his mind. Like
Maurice, the soldier had the unpleasant feeling that in the
Professor’s cogitations his wishes or arguments had little part. The
issue would be decided by considerations far less obvious.

“Your idea is excellent,” he heard at last, with sensible relief.
“Such a marriage would at once checkmate Scythia, and strengthen
enormously Mr Teffany’s position. I will represent the propriety of it
to him as soon as we reach Kallimeri, and there need be no difficulty
with the lady. She will be in our hands.”

“Are you mad?” demanded Wylie, seizing him again by the arm as he
turned quickly towards the carriage. “You can’t be serious in
proposing to put pressure upon the Princess. Why, Teffany would become
your enemy for life. The Princess comes to Kallimeri purely for
refuge, and incidentally to see her old friends before returning to
Scythia. If Teffany can induce her to stay, it’s all right. Otherwise,
we must take her back to the Consulate to-morrow.”

“That will be too late,” muttered the Professor. “The streets will be
clear again, and she will pass safely.”

“Look here,” said Wylie; “let me give you a word of advice. You and I
are men of the world, and know exactly how much and how little you
mean when you say things like that. But it would not sound well to the
Teffanys, and they might believe you meant it. Do you see?”

The Professor signified reluctantly that he did, and asked, “Then what
is the good of taking the Princess to Kallimeri?”

“Simply to bring them together. If Teffany wants her, he won’t let her
go again, after his sister and I have piled up the agony about endless
separation and the dangers that will surround the Princess in
Scythia.”

“Ah, and what interest have you and Miss Teffany in the affair?”
demanded the Professor, severely.

“Miss Teffany hopes to gratify her brother, who would have come into
Therma to-day to try and see the Princess, if I had not insisted on
coming instead. My only interest is to gratify a wish expressed by
Miss Teffany.”

Baffled by the unmoved tone, Professor Panagiotis went on towards the
carriage, where Eirene, tired out, had fallen asleep in her corner.
Wylie presented the Professor to her, and gave what money he had with
him to the friendly sergeant, to distribute among his men, before
taking his seat. The soldiers who had formed the cordon surrounded the
carriage, and they drove slowly towards the gate nearest Kallimeri.
Many streets were blocked with the ruins of houses which had been
destroyed, in others fires were raging and troops forbade passage, in
others the search for revolutionists was still being carried on, to
the accompaniment of shots and shrieks, others again were empty, save
for rigid forms prone in the shadow of the houses. At the gate, the
Vali’s seal, exhibited by the officer of the escort, obtained them a
speedy passage, and the soldiers convoyed them through the environs of
the town until they were safely on the upland road leading to
Kallimeri. Then the escort was dismissed, the driver was at length
allowed to whip up his horses, and in the wild, headlong style dear to
him and his tribe they rattled up to the villa.

“Oh, what has been happening?” cried Zoe, rushing down from a point of
vantage beside the gate. “We have seen explosions, and the most
dreadful fires--not the ordinary kind that happen every night, but
whole streets must have been burnt. We were all so frightened. I have
been watching here for hours.”

“That was very dangerous,” said Wylie, his heart leaping,
nevertheless. He had jumped out of the carriage to meet her, and the
Professor and Eirene, the latter still slumbering, had driven on. “If
a revolutionist had been hanging about ready to blow up the villa, he
would have killed you, lest you should give the alarm.”

“But in that case I shouldn’t have been much better off in the house,”
said Zoe flippantly. “It was revolutionists, then--who have been
blowing up the town, I mean? So you were not able to deliver my note,
I suppose?”

“Wasn’t I?” said Wylie triumphantly. “Why, I’ve brought the Princess
back. She’s in the carriage.”

“In the carriage? Eirene? and you have kept me walking slowly here!
What will she think of me?”

“Wait one minute,” said Wylie, as Zoe quickened her pace to a run;
“I’m very proud of myself for the way in which I did your errand, for
I have had to employ all the resources of diplomacy to overcome the
Princess’s objections to coming here, and the Professor’s objections
to having her. But we must manage to rush things a bit to-morrow
morning, for she means to go back.”

“And if she does, we may as well give it up, for she will be out of
our reach,” said Zoe. “Clearly we must precipitate matters. Oh, but
how did you know what I was hoping for?” she cried suddenly. “I never
told you.”

“I guessed, from what you told me about your brother, and then it came
to me in a flash that we might get things settled at once, thanks to
all this affair in the city. Nobody knows where the Princess is, you
see, and it’ll take some time to track her.”

“You mean they could get married before she is found? Oh, how
splendid! We must manage it. I will think about it to-night, and you
must play up to me to-morrow.”

“Trust me!” said Wylie, as they arrived at the door, where Madame
Panagiotis, a very correct German lady of commanding proportions, was
looking with evident suspicion at Eirene, with her bare shoulders and
tattered evening gown. With a cry of delight the two girls rushed into
each other’s arms, and on Zoe’s guarantee, Madame Panagiotis consented
to receive the dishevelled-looking stranger. There was a room next to
Zoe’s she could have, she said, and she herself would lend her decent
clothes, unless Miss Teffany cared to do so. Zoe declared joyfully
that no one else should look after her friend, and carried her off
upstairs at once, pausing only to say aside to Wylie--

“Just tell Maurice, as you pass, that she is here. Then perhaps he
will be able to sleep.”

Returning to Eirene, she found the Professor saying pointedly how glad
he was to receive under his roof a younger branch of the illustrious
house to which his honoured guests belonged, and she swept her off at
once, afraid that he might go on to say something that would spoil her
plans.

“Isn’t Madame Panagiotis funny?” she asked of Eirene, when they were
by themselves. “Maurice and I used to wonder whether she would sit on
the floor and eat with her fingers, and you can imagine our feelings
when we found her such a monument of propriety. Do you know, the
Professor called her at first ‘the Mrs Professor’ when he talked
English--_die Frau Professorin_, you know--but he must have seen it
sounded queer, and he gave it up.”

Eirene sat listening passively while Zoe took down her hair and
brushed it. “Oh, Zoe,” she broke out suddenly, “it is such a rest to
be here. I don’t mind any one else--Professor or Professorin--if I can
be near you and Maurice. You can’t guess how I have longed for you!”

“It’s awfully sweet of you to say it,” said Zoe, penitently. “I know I
was perfectly horrid to you often.”

“You weren’t!” was the indignant reply. “You and Maurice were always
just the same to me, whether you thought I was Miss Smith or a
Princess. You were quite right to scold me when I said silly things.
And, Zoe, you were right about Vlasto, and I was too silly. He was
Nicetas Mitsopoulo, Chariclea Ladoguin’s brother, in disguise. I
recognised him as soon as he was presented to me, and I thought how
you would triumph. I deserved it.”

“At any rate, it’s quite new for us to be paying each other
compliments. And have you brought the girdle of Isidora with you?”

“Oh no, how could I? I did not dare to carry it in my dress any
longer, because of the maid. Do you know, Zoe, they were so anxious
that I should send it as a peace-offering to the Empress? Chariclea
and her brother both hinted at it. But I would not do it. It seemed
like buying back her favour by giving up my rights--your rights, too.
I found out a hiding-place for it, but I don’t know whether it’s safe.
Perhaps they will discover it this evening while I am away, and send
it to Pavelsburg, pretending that it comes from me!”

“Well, if they do, you can’t help it,” said Zoe. “Let it alone for
to-night. Are you frightfully tired, Eirene? There are such a lot of
things I want to ask you. Look here, let us bring your bed into my
room, and then we can talk without disturbing any one till we go to
sleep. I know Maurice will want you all the morning.”

Loss of sleep, and her adventures of the evening, did not seem to have
told on Eirene’s spirits when she appeared the next day. Zoe had
dressed her hair low to hide the cuts and bruises received in the
explosion, and she looked very pretty in a white gown, which Zoe
surrendered to her heroically, though she had just had it made for
herself to replace the horrible German ready-made garments with which
she had been obliged to content herself on reaching Therma. The two
girls were sitting in the verandah looking into the inner courtyard of
the house, when Wylie, already primed for his part, brought up the
steps first an armful of cushions, and then Maurice, and established
him in a long chair.

“Could I speak to you a minute?” he said to Zoe, as they had agreed,
and she went to the other end of the verandah with him.

“I really have something to say,” he said. “It’s quite impossible for
the Princess to get back this morning. Firing is still going on in the
town, and they don’t think things will quiet down until fresh troops
arrive, which won’t be till to-night. What do you think of my riding
in and asking the Ladoguins to send a proper escort for her?”

“It would provide the necessity for decision, which is what we want,”
said Zoe gravely. “I will call her away to write a letter to Madame
Ladoguin when it is time for you to start. Perhaps they will have
settled things before that. I shall leave them to themselves for the
morning, as soon as I have explained to Eirene that she must stay here
till she is sent for.”

“Won’t that be rather pointed--leaving them to themselves, I mean?”
asked Wylie solicitously.

Zoe gave him a look of pity. “I shall stay here,” she said. “If they
talk loud, I can hear them, and join in, but if they choose to talk
low, I shall work quietly.”

“I suppose I mayn’t come and share your vigil?”

“No, your company would be too distracting. I must be unobtrusively on
the watch, you know.”

Wylie departed without a murmur, possibly a little to Zoe’s
disappointment, and only returned, equipped for riding, about two
hours later.

“Now for it!” said Zoe. “I must take my courage in both hands. Shall I
save the situation, or shall I ruin it?”

“But don’t you think it’s all right by this time?”

“Not a bit. Every now and then I have heard what they said, and it was
always ‘Do you remember?’ like children talking over a Sunday-school
treat. I might have sat with them the whole time. Well, now to
interrupt them. Doesn’t it make you feel a brute?”

“Not in the least, nor you either. You know perfectly well that you
feel like a whole three-volume novel, or a goddess out of a machine,
or anything else that annihilates time and space to make two lovers
happy.”

Zoe looked at him critically. “You mustn’t thought-read to such an
extent,” she said, “or I shall be afraid of you. It’s uncanny. Now I
am going to make the plunge. Eirene, are you ready? Captain Wylie is
waiting to start.”

“Start? Where to?” demanded Maurice.

“For Therma, of course, to take Eirene’s letter. If she is to get back
to-night, she must be sent for.”

“With these outrages still going on, when she has barely escaped with
her life already? Nonsense! she can’t go back.”

“I can’t stay away any longer,” said Eirene.

“It’s awfully hard that you should just get this one glimpse of us,
like a condemned man saying good-bye to his friends, and then go away
for ever,” said Zoe.

“Why should she go away at all?” said Maurice suddenly. “Zoe, give us
two minutes more. And just tell Wylie, will you? Eirene,” as Zoe
vanished, “do you want to go back?”

“I must,” she said, smiling at him bravely.

“Can you bear to go back? I can’t bear you to go.”

“But I must,” she murmured, trying to draw away her hand.

“Oh no, you needn’t, if--Eirene, I know it will sound frightful cheek
to you, but I must say it--if you would marry me.”

“You are sorry for me,” she said quickly, “because you know I am no
longer the heir.”

“I never thought of it. I am sorry for you, but only because it’s so
rough on you to give you the alternative of taking me or going back to
a life you dread.”

 “_I can’t bear you to go_.” “_But I must_,” _she murmured._]

“I suppose you understand,” said Eirene with energy, “that if I went
back to Scythia I should be replaced in my old position, and be rich
and received at Court?”

“Yes, I know, and I can only offer you a country life in England--for
certain. Anything else is mere possibility.”

“Do you imagine I am thinking of that? I want to be sure you do not
say this out of pity.”

“But I do. I want you to take pity on me.”

Sunshine succeeded momentary dismay on Eirene’s face.

“You know,” she said softly, “there was a condition to be fulfilled
before I could be received at Court again?”

“That you should marry some one, I suppose? Who is the brute?”

“Oh no, they would not say that in words. The condition was that I
should write to ask forgiveness, and say I was sorry for running
away.”

“Well, and did you do it?”

“No, I would not--because I am glad, glad, glad, that I ran away. If I
had not----”

“Yes?” Maurice had her hand fast by this time.

“I should still have been a rebel, opposing the head of my house,”
said Eirene demurely.

“We might even have been pitted against one another,” said Maurice,
with equal solemnity. “By the bye, have you gone into my claims at
all?”

“No, they are yours, and you believe they are just--that is enough,”
said Eirene.




 CHAPTER XXIV.
 THROUGH ANOTHER MAN’S EYES.

“Well, did I play up to you?” asked Wylie, finding Zoe in the
verandah the next day.

“You did, indeed. Your booted and spurred impatience was most telling.
I’m sure it woke Maurice to a sense of the desperate nature of the
situation, and so brought about the happy result. Don’t you feel proud
of your first attempt at match-making? I do.”

“You were the match-maker; I only acted under your orders. What am I
to have for it?” demanded Wylie.

“A promise of further employment if your services should at any time
be needed,” said Zoe, with unnatural coolness, looking round
desperately for a way of escape. “Oh, here are Maurice and Eirene,
released at last from their conference with the Professor!” she cried,
with real relief. “Well, what have you settled?” as they came up the
steps, Maurice obviously quivering with excitement, Eirene reluctant
and blushing.

“Everything!” cried Maurice triumphantly. “No, Eirene, I’m not going
to shout or chortle, or do anything I promised you not to, but I must
tell these two, because they’ll have to know, and we want Wylie’s
help. Where are you off to, Wylie? Come back at once. You are our
stand-by, our victim, our resource, as you have been all along.”

“Didn’t know you’d want me,” muttered Wylie, returning, and Maurice
perceived that they had arrived at an inopportune moment, but was wise
enough to take no notice.

“We want you tremendously,” he said. “I must tell you that Eirene is
behaving like a brick. She is willing to marry me as soon as ever it
can be arranged. It’s a proof of confidence I should never have
ventured to ask of her, and if ever I fail to justify it, I hope you
two will just talk to me as I deserve.” He took Eirene’s hand gently
in his, and she gave him a smile which was not far removed from tears,
and then drew back into the shadow behind him, unable to meet the eyes
of the others. “You see,” he went on, “it will save us no end of
bother if we can only get married before the Ladoguins can track
Eirene. It seems that the Professor made it right with the soldiers
who escorted you here, and the gate-keepers, so that no one will know
there was a lady with you, and most happily, no one will dare to make
inquiries openly, lest it should be asked why Madame Ladoguin didn’t
take better care of her charge. The Professor thinks that when they
find no trace of Eirene near the wrecked carriage--for, of course, the
Roumis who attacked her will say nothing, for their own sakes--they
will give out boldly that she was killed in the first explosion. We
can’t let that remain uncontradicted, for the sake of her claims, but
it will be much safer if she only comes forward again as my wife.”

“Look here,” said Wylie, “I don’t want to spoil your pleasant
arrangement, but where is the danger from Scythia now? The Princess is
of age; how can any one prevent her from marrying you if she likes?”

“What’s to keep them from saying that she’s under age, or mad, or
anything?” demanded Maurice. “We could call for an inquiry, but she
wouldn’t be allowed to remain with us, and you ought to know, if any
one does, how hard it would be to get at her if they once got her into
their hands again. And besides, they could bring such pressure to bear
that no Greek priest in the world would dare to marry us.”

“I should like to join Maurice’s Church,” explained Eirene softly to
Zoe, “but he thinks it would be such a good example for the Emathians
if they saw that people of different creeds needn’t necessarily
quarrel.”

“Poor thing! Is he offering you up as a political sacrifice already?”
said Zoe.

“But, I say,” said Wylie hastily, “you seem to forget that a religious
marriage isn’t enough. You’ll certainly need a civil ceremony as well,
if not two. Do you propose to drive up to the Scythian Consulate and
request Ladoguin to perform his duties as registrar?”

“Scarcely,” said Maurice, “though for a long time we couldn’t make out
how we were to manage without his services. A declaration that we were
Sovereign Princes and could legislate for ourselves would hardly meet
the case. But, happily, Eirene has remembered that her father never
surrendered his Dacian nationality. When he went to Scythia he held on
to his estate in Dacia--I suppose to have something to fall back upon
if things went wrong--and now it belongs to her. The simplest thing
would be for us all to migrate there, and be married by the village
pope and at the British Legation, but the trains are sure to be
watched, however unobtrusively. So we must take advantage of the
nearest spot of Dacian ground, which is their Consulate in Therma. The
Professor is on the best of terms with the Consul, for Dacia has not
so far joined in the scramble for influence in Emathia, and sides
rather with the Greeks than any one else. No doubt she hopes to have
her reward some day, but that doesn’t signify now. There’s a church
quite close to the Consulate which is regarded as their special
preserve, so we can have both ceremonies complete.”

“The Princess will be married fast enough, but I’m pretty sure you
won’t,” objected Wylie.

“I shall be if the British Consul or acting-Consul is present, and
registers the marriage,” said Maurice. “The Professor has been looking
it up. Now, Wylie, this is where you come in. We want you to get round
your friend Sir Frank Francis. The best of it is”--Maurice’s voice
became unsteady--“that if the Ladoguins have told him anything about
Eirene’s disappearance, he’ll suspect _you_ of having carried her off,
and of wanting his kind offices for yourself. So the first thing
you’ll have to do will be to disabuse his mind on that point. Then you
must swear him to secrecy, and tell him the real state of the case.
Tell him nothing would have induced us to patronise the rival
establishment if we hadn’t felt certain that, if we came to him, his
conscience would have driven him to give Ladoguin an opportunity of
forbidding the banns. As it is, he is only asked to attend at the
Dacian church and Consulate, and register the marriage of a British
subject in the usual way. If he feels that even that is too much, ask
him to take a day off, and appoint his chief clerk acting-Consul for
the occasion.”

“But if he won’t, what is to happen?” said Zoe.

“Why, we should have to escape in a half-married condition, and find a
less Scythia-ridden British Consul. But Wylie must put things so
movingly that he won’t have the heart to refuse. After all, I am the
head of Eirene’s family, and who has the right to arrange for her
marriage if I haven’t? And if I choose to marry her myself, instead of
handing her over to some one else, and she doesn’t object, who has any
right to prevent me?”

“All very well,” said Wylie. “It sounds most logical and convincing,
but you know there are a good many people who both could and would
prevent you. Don’t be afraid; I’ll exhaust my eloquence on Sir Frank,
and if nothing else will bring him, I’ll persuade him it’s his duty to
be present to make sure that I am not marrying the Princess after all.
Well, consider the ceremony safely accomplished. What next?”

“Next we are to be very snobbish, and send detailed announcements of
our marriage--showing that it means the union of the elder and younger
branches of the descendants of John Theophanis--to the principal
papers of the world. Also, Eirene is to announce it to the various
royalties whose acquaintance she enjoys.”

“And where are you to be when the announcement bursts upon the
universe?”

“At home, I hope, for our honeymoon. The Professor seems inclined to
allow us a breathing-space. I can’t quite make out what he’s up to,
but apparently he thinks of nothing at present but getting the wedding
over. I fancy winter is a close time in Emathia, too. I should like to
show Stone Acton to Eirene, and we should be out of the way until the
fuss had blown over.”

“Well, I hope you mean to apply for police protection,” growled Wylie.

“Or import a detachment of Pinkerton men from America to garrison the
house, with instructions to shoot at sight any foreigner who appears
in the village,” suggested Zoe.

“And what next?” persisted Wylie.

“That’s what I can’t quite make out. Eirene’s got an idea that the
Professor has in his mind’s eye--or even in his actual
possession--some fortified island in the Archipelago, where we might
practise sovereignty, so to speak; but that makes him a sort of
benevolent magician, and I can’t quite fit it in with the other things
I know of him.”

“Oh, but it’s such a delightful idea!” cried Zoe. “You would stay
quietly in your island when nothing particular was going on, and when
adventures were going to begin, you would be close at hand. But you
must be sure and let me know whenever that is, and I shall come from
the ends of the earth.”

“But what are you proposing to do?” demanded Maurice.

“My dear Maurice, allow me a little liberty. You didn’t expect me to
trail about after you and Eirene, did you? I have so many plans that I
don’t know which to carry out first. I am going to write my great
book, and to pose as a Balkan expert in literary society, and to
travel all over the world.”

“Oh, well, I daresay circumstances will make the decision for you,”
said Maurice, with a significance which Zoe recognised and resented.
There was a touch of defiance in her rejoinder.

“On the whole, I think I shall choose the literary part first. I shall
shut myself up, and write and write; but every now and then I shall
pounce out on unhappy people who think that the Emathian problem is a
simple one, or who make mistakes in spelling Balkan names.”

“But who is going to accept you as a critic?” asked Maurice.

“Every one,” triumphantly. “I have the one great qualification. I have
failed in literature.”

“But I thought you were going to succeed now. You’ll find yourself in
a glass house--a mark for all the other critics.”

“Maurice, I have had to tell you before that you were dense, but I am
sorry to have to repeat it in Eirene’s presence. When my success has
come--as soon as ever I am sure of it--I shall start upon my travels.
In Tibet or the Sahara I shan’t be bothered by what people are saying
about me. I shall have quite enough to do with taking care of myself.”

“I am sorry to break in on these blissful dreams of the future,” said
Wylie, in rather a forced voice, “but the fact is, my extended leave
is nearly out, and my time here is limited. How soon am I to intimate
to Sir Frank that his presence will be required at the Dacian
Consulate?”

“This day week,” returned Maurice promptly. “Eirene is pledged not to
protest, and the Professor has promised to get her the Patriarch’s
blessing as a reward.”

“Then I shall just have time to see you through. I sail in the
afternoon.”

“If there’s any risk, we’ll put the wedding earlier,” said Maurice.
“Don’t mind my feelings; tell me if it’s necessary. I must have you to
support me.”

“Oh, you’ll have Armitage.”

“I shall have Armitage anyhow. The Professor says two best men are
necessary. But you I must have--as better best man, I suppose. So let
me know the worst, or I’ll keep you back by force, and get you
cashiered.”

“Oh, that’ll be all right,” said Wylie, compassionating Eirene’s
blushes. “I hope you realise what a lucky fellow you are, and that the
Princess won’t let you forget it.”

“How could I forget it, when I have got her?” demanded Maurice. “He
talks treason, doesn’t he, Eirene? Let us depart in dudgeon, and leave
him and Zoe to plot the subjugation of Sir Frank. No, Zoe, we don’t
want you. I am surprised that a person of your discernment should try
to make a third in the walks of an engaged couple. _You’re not the
only one in the family to take up match-making_,” he added in a
whisper, as Zoe sat down again, somewhat discomposed. But the
emergency put her on her mettle, and she turned to Wylie with smiling
coolness as Maurice and Eirene went down the steps into the garden.

“It’s delicious to see them looking so happy, isn’t it?” she remarked.
“It makes one feel quite choky.”

“Doesn’t it make you feel that such perfect bliss ought to be
infectious? Don’t you think you and I----”

“Oh no, please don’t!” she cried.

“What am I not to do?”

“Don’t say it. I like you tremendously, of course, and I think you are
the most splendid friend any one ever had, but I want to travel about
for ever so long, just as I like, and write, and be _in_ things, you
know.”

“Then you haven’t been in things enough the last three months?”

“I should think not! It has only whetted my appetite for more. Things
are so frightfully interesting. I should like to plunge right into the
midst of life.”

“Is it absolutely necessary to take the plunge alone?”

“Oh, I know what you are going to say. But don’t you see that I want
to be without responsibilities for a time? I have always had Maurice
on my mind, but now I can hand the dear boy over with an easy
conscience to Eirene, and do just as I like. I want to be able to shut
myself up and write, or start off on my travels, and go on, or come
back, or break my journey, just as the fancy takes me--not to have to
feel that I ought to be doing anything whatever.”

“You would soon get tired of that sort of life.”

“So everybody would say, but I want to try it. But you are better than
most people. You are the only man I ever met who wouldn’t have been
scandalised at what I have said, and done everything to keep me back.”

“Perhaps I know better than to say all I feel. Or perhaps I am trying
to allure you by a deceptive show of sympathy. Honestly, Zoe, your
life shouldn’t be a dull one if I could help it--with me, I mean,” he
added lamely. “And you can’t think I should try to stop your writing.
I should be awfully proud of your books.”

“I know. It’s very nice of you to say it, but you don’t understand.
Think of me stuck down in a small Indian station----” Wylie opened his
lips, but closed them again. “You told me long ago you were to be
stationed in a horrid, humdrum little place when you went back.
Nothing would happen, there would be the same dull, deadly monotony of
duties every day--and yet I couldn’t have a writing fit in peace. It
isn’t even as if you were still on the frontier.”

“It’s rather a good thing I’m not, if your feelings would be liable to
change the moment I was transferred anywhere else. But I should have
thought a quiet, regular life would have been the best possible thing
for your writing.”

“For manufacturing books, not for writing. Why, just think, if I woke
up one day with a perfectly splendid idea, and wanted simply to sit
down and work it out--not to bother about meals or anything, except
coffee and biscuits, or something of that kind, which I could eat
without thinking about it. You would come--I know you would--and sweep
my books away ruthlessly, and insist upon my taking proper food, and
expect me to be grateful to you for doing it!”

“And I should be disappointed? Well, I will try to moderate my
expectations. It might come to our both having scratch meals,
surrounded by books, at opposite corners of the table.”

“No, you would never get like that, and it’s quite right you
shouldn’t. You would have your duties, demanding punctuality and
regularity, and all the things I want to escape from for a time, and
you would insist on them. It would be different if you were more
easy-going.”

“I’m afraid the woman who marries me will have to take me as I
am--unless she can change me. Zoe, take me in hand, won’t you? I’ll
give you a free hand to make all the alterations and improvements you
like.”

“But it’s just those very qualities that I like in you. No, you won’t
see. When--I mean if--I marry, I shall really do my duty and settle
down. If I went back with you now, I should sink my own life in yours.
I should think of nothing but seeing that your meals were in time and
as you liked them, and that the house and everything did you credit,
and you would congratulate yourself on having driven all my foolish
aspirations out of my head. And then one day I should wake up to find
that I was growing old, and had done nothing, and the visions had
faded, and I should--_hate_ you. No, I shall never be young again, I
shan’t always feel my heart leap up with a great idea coming
suddenly--I must follow the gleam while I can. It will be different in
a few years, but at present I have such lots of interests, and I can’t
narrow them all down to----”

“To one man and his career? Well, put it that you spend these years as
you suggest. What then?”

“Why, whether I succeed or fail, I shall have tried my wings, ‘proved
my soul,’ like Paracelsus. Perhaps the visions will fade naturally,
perhaps they will be more under control. Then I shall have time for
the other side of life.”

“In other words, you might be willing then to turn to the man who
loved you and had spent his best years waiting for you?”

“You are trying to make me out perfectly horrid! I--I----” Zoe blushed
and stammered--“I shouldn’t mind very much being engaged, if it was
quite certain that the engagement was a long one.”

“But I should. Do you really expect me to go on working quietly, not
knowing where you were, or in what wild scrapes you might be involving
yourself? Suppose you were again in circumstances like this summer’s.
Another man is thrown with you, as I have been, falls in love with
you, as I have done; you discourage him steadily, as you have
discouraged me, but he forces an explanation--also like me. You plead
that you are already engaged. ‘Why, what kind of double-distilled fool
can the fellow be, to let you run about by yourself like this? He
can’t care for you much!’ And it would be perfectly just.”

“I have said more to you than I could ever have imagined I should say
to any man on earth,” said Zoe resolutely, but with a tremor in her
voice. “If you won’t wait, it is not for me to offer concessions. Why
are you so impatient?”

“Because life is short and apt to end suddenly, I suppose. What’s the
good of talking, Zoe? I want you, and you don’t want me, and that’s
all about it.”

“Oh,” said Zoe impulsively, “when you talk like that, I have a feeling
as if I saw your real self for a moment. The rest of the time you seem
not to be putting forth all your strength. If you did, I---- What is
it?”

“It is just that. I believe that if I looked you straight in the eyes,
and said, ‘Come,’ you would come. I could make you listen to me, but I
won’t. I don’t want my will merely to triumph over yours; I want your
sober judgment to decide that you care for me enough to give up
everything else, no matter what, for my sake, and not regret it.”

Her puzzled face was a mute request to him to go on.

“Remember what I have learnt, since I knew you first, about your
brother’s future prospects. The Professor has been rubbing it in
diligently. If Teffany’s claims were once recognised, or even
influentially taken up, think of the gulf between you and me. Married
to a poor and undistinguished soldier, you would be heavily
handicapped; free, you could aspire to almost any position. Unless you
really loved me, heart and soul, you must feel that I was a drag on
you, and resent it, and I--I could stand anything but seeing you
repent that you had married me.”

“Oh, how unkind you are!” cried Zoe. “As if anything that could
possibly happen could make me change! Why, if I were a princess, and
you came in as a stranger, I should step down to you and hold out my
hand.”

“And I should kiss it and pass on.”

“You are cruel. Don’t you see how terribly I should be wanting you if
I did such a thing as that? Oh, promise, promise, that if I ever do it
you won’t pass on!”

Wylie laughed bitterly. “What a queer girl you are!” he said. “Your
eyes are full of tears at the mere thought that you may want me some
day, and yet you won’t take me now.”

“I was feeling it as if it was in a book,” murmured Zoe shamefacedly.
“But you will promise?”

“No, I won’t, because I shouldn’t do it. I shall do my level best to
forget you from the day I leave this.”

This was high treason, and cried aloud for condign punishment.

“Can you forget when you like?” asked Zoe incisively.

“No, I wish I could! It won’t be much comfort for me, away in the
Soudan, to think of you wandering about the world and getting into all
sorts of difficulties.”

“The Soudan? But aren’t you going back to India?”

“No, I am to be lent to the Egyptian Government for special work in
the Soudan. That was how I got longer leave.”

He went away abruptly, and Zoe gazed after him with mingled feelings.

“Of course we shall meet again,” she said to herself. “It’s all
nonsense about forgetting. He can’t forget if he really cares. And we
shall be older then, and more tolerant, and get into one another’s
ways better.” A vision crossed her mind of herself and Wylie placed
farther apart by the passage of years, both more fixed in their own
ways and opinions, each finding it more difficult to understand the
other, but she brushed it aside. “I have a right to live my own life,
just as he has a right to try and get me to live his, if he can. I
wonder whether he could have made me marry him, as he said? It would
be hard to refuse, I know, if he had looked at me. I--I almost wish he
had tried. And why didn’t he tell me about the Soudan until just at
the end?”

She wondered in vain, but Wylie vouchsafed enlightenment later to
Eirene, who felt that her own engagement supplied a vantage-ground
from which to stretch out helping hands to those who were less
fortunate in their love affairs. With the gracious little air of
condescension which she had now laid aside in Maurice’s case, she took
Wylie to task.

“The Soudan is just what Zoe would love,” she said. “You should have
told her about it sooner--quite at the beginning. Why didn’t you?”

“Because I didn’t want her to marry me merely as a purveyor of
adventures.”

“You are a very rude man,” said Eirene, with dignity.

“Sorry,” said Wylie. “It’s not the first time you’ve had that against
me, is it?”

“But it makes me unhappy that you should manage things so badly, for
you are the very person for Zoe.”

“You mustn’t flatter my self-conceit by agreeing with me. She doesn’t
think so, you see.”

“Oh, but she will, some day. Don’t think me meddling, prying”--she
blushed--“but you won’t suddenly marry some one else in despair, will
you?”

“There won’t be much chance of marrying any one where I shall be,” he
said, looking down at her kindly, “so I can reassure your mind by
saying that it’s in my work I hope to forget all this.”




 CHAPTER XXV.
 “POUR MIEUX SAUTER.”

Maurice and Eirene were married. In the little church of Hagios
Gerasimos, Maurice the servant of God had been crowned for Eirene the
handmaid of God, and Eirene the handmaid of God for Maurice the
servant of God. They had drunk of the Common Cup, walked in procession
round the church with the crowns held over their heads by the
groomsmen, exchanged wedding-rings, to Maurice’s surprise and
gratification, and they had been dismissed with the blessing of
Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Rachel. Sir Frank
Francis was duly present to register the marriage. Wylie had again
displayed his diplomatic powers by laying siege first to Lady Francis,
whose fertile imagination, defying probabilities and dates, swept her,
as soon as she heard his story, to the wild conclusion that he had
been wooing Eirene for his friend during those trying weeks when he
had maintained so assiduous a watch on the Scythian Consulate. Even
when approached through the person who might be presumed to know his
weak points best, Sir Frank was not easy to persuade. His promise of
secrecy prevented his revealing everything at once to M. Ladoguin, but
he declared long and loudly that he would have nothing to do with any
clandestine, hole-and-corner business. It was by working on his
feelings of sympathy for Eirene that his wife at length extorted his
consent. The poor girl would be indubitably married; was it to be
thought of that her bridegroom should be bound only by honour? Once
away from Therma, he might or might not repeat the ceremony before a
British Consul, and was it just to subject the bride to such a risk?
Maurice would certainly not have recognised his own character had he
heard Lady Francis expatiating on the danger of Eirene’s too probably
finding herself a deserted wife, and Wylie was filled with grim
amusement when the injustice of it occurred to him; but the natural
desire of an honest man to see that a young fellow did honestly by the
girl who trusted him carried the day over Sir Frank’s sense of his
duty to his colleague. Two stipulations he made, which were promptly
accepted, namely, that he should see Eirene alone before the ceremony,
in order to ascertain her true wishes and make sure that she was not
breaking any former contract of betrothal, and that on the day after
the wedding he should be allowed to make a clean breast of the matter
to M. Ladoguin.

The arrangements of the wedding-day were curious, for though the
wedding itself was obliged to take place in the morning to allow Wylie
to be present, the ship in which the bridal pair and Zoe had taken
their passage for England did not sail till the evening. Accordingly,
after the ceremony Armitage escorted Wylie to his steamer, and the
rest of the party returned to Kallimeri, Eirene wearing Greek peasant
costume and passing as the maid of Madame Panagiotis, for there was to
be no relaxation of vigilance until they were safely at sea. Zoe was
in specially high spirits, accusing the bride and bridegroom of
sharing the sense of depression which is usually believed to settle
down upon a wedding-party after the departure on their honeymoon of
the chief actors.

“Stuff!” said Maurice. “Why, my wedding-ring alone would keep me from
being depressed,” regarding his hand proudly. “It’s really awfully
swagger. Makes a man feel so undeniably married, don’t you know?”

“Oh, that’s all very well,” said Zoe. “It’s no use trying to wear a
mask before me. You forget that I have an advantage which no other
living bridesmaid possesses. I am like the Infant Phenomenon, going
away with Mr and Mrs Lillyvick on their wedding tour. Have you read
‘Nicholas Nickleby,’ Eirene? Not? What a lot of things we have to
teach her, haven’t we, Maurice?”

“There’s one thing I should like to teach you, and that is to know a
good man when you see one,” growled Maurice.

Zoe turned upon him. “If you think you are doing Captain Wylie any
good by the way you have behaved to me all this week, you are very
much mistaken,” she said. “Any one would think I was a child who
didn’t know her own mind, instead of a reasonable being, acting
deliberately. I told him exactly how I felt, and he understands. He
doesn’t wish to marry me while I feel as I do; he said so. And now I
hope you will leave off treating me in this absurd way, as if I was in
disgrace, and allow me the liberty I allow you.”

“Oh, Zoe, Maurice didn’t mean that!” cried Eirene anxiously. “He was
only so sorry for Captain Wylie.”

“I hope, Maurice,” said Zoe, unappeased, “that you realise how
detestably you have behaved, when you see that it’s necessary for
Eirene to interpret your intentions to me.”

She left the verandah with great dignity, but found herself confronted
by Armitage on the steps.

“Oh, are you back already?” she cried. “Well, did you see him off?”

“Yes, the steamer was actually punctual; we had barely time, in fact.
He begged me to give his farewells and good wishes all over again. I
only stayed to watch him out of the harbour, and hurried back here,
because I thought Mrs Teffany might let me make a sketch of her in
that Greek dress. It’s awfully fetching, and I shan’t have another
chance.”

Armitage was to wait until the next steamer, so as to cover the
retreat of the rest, or rather, to find out if any measures were
likely to be taken against them. What his paper thought of his long
delay at Therma he did not inquire, trusting to be able to placate it
with a terrific double-page drawing of the city on the night of the
dynamite outrages, as seen from Kallimeri, as well as by a whole
supplement illustrating the adventures of his friends, whose capture
by the brigands had first brought him south.

“If you would stand just as you are now, leaning against that pillar,
Mrs Teffany,” he continued persuasively. “You see, I have your husband
in Greek dress already, and I could work up the two sketches into a
tremendously telling portrait.”

“I bag it, then,” said Maurice. “All right, Eirene, let him do it if
he’s taken that way. It’s only like being photographed at an ordinary
wedding.”

“It ought to have been a group,” objected Zoe, whose anger had
evaporated before the duty of arranging Eirene so that her costume
showed to the best advantage. With skilful fingers she pulled out here
and patted down there, until Armitage begged her not to make the
effect too studied.

“Talking about groups, we really ought to have had one taken before
Wylie left,” said Maurice. “Just the four of us who were captured
together. He always seems rather left out, and yet he worked so
tremendously for us.”

“Oh, that reminds me,” said Armitage. “I can’t help thinking”--he went
on, with some embarrassment--“at least, I know I should like to be
reminded if it was my case. It doesn’t seem quite fair to Wylie----
You know he paid your ransom?”

“No!” cried Maurice. “I thought my bankers did it. Why, this explains
the apologetic, self-congratulatory letter they wrote to me this week.
I was too busy to bother about it, but I was going to ask for an
explanation when I got home. Wylie paid, you say?”

“I believe the Professor raised some of it. But I know Wylie scraped
together fifteen thousand, by selling out every shilling of his
investments, and mortgaging the little place he has in the north. You
see, your bankers had refused to advance the money, and the brigands
had sworn to kill you if it wasn’t forthcoming.”

“But why in the world has he said nothing about it? What a set of
ungrateful brutes he must think us! Oh, I say, this is the rankest
thing I ever heard!” cried Maurice, tramping about the verandah in his
perturbation.

“Why, you see, the money didn’t actually ransom you. The brigands
bagged it all right, but Scythia had been beforehand with us, and we
might as well have chucked it into the sea. I only found out Wylie’s
feeling about it just now. He forbade me to say a word to you--said
his pay gave him enough for his wants, and his place would do as well
with a mortgage on it as without--but I thought you ought to know.”

“I’m jolly glad you did!” cried Maurice. “I feel a perfect hound.
After all Wylie has done for us--and everything----”

Zoe had risen suddenly and gone down the steps, her face resolutely
turned from the rest, her hands clenched until the nails made deep
marks in the palms. A rush of overwhelming shame, unavailing regret,
had swept over her. Stiffly she walked along the garden paths, guiding
herself instinctively, her head held rigidly, her eyes seeing nothing.
Presently, in the shelter of a clump of bushes, out of sight of the
verandah, Eirene caught her up.

“Oh, Zoe, don’t look so dreadful!” she entreated. “He must know you
didn’t know.”

“‘There are strange punishments for such,’” came harshly from Zoe’s
lips. “It’s only what I deserve.”

“But,” suggested Eirene timidly, “Maurice will pay him back. He won’t
really suffer.”

“It’s not that. It is that he could do it, and say nothing, even
when---- Oh, Eirene, you don’t understand, you can’t understand. Be
thankful you can’t. You didn’t shut your heart against love; you took
it and were thankful. I chose to live my own life, and I have got it.”

“But if he really cares----” ventured Eirene, with increasing
nervousness. “Oh, Zoe, I don’t like to say it, but if I could do
anything----?” An angry flush rose to Zoe’s face, but faded quickly.

“No, you can’t. He knows me now as I am, you see, and it would be no
use. You understand, Eirene, there is nothing to be done--nothing
whatever. Swear that you won’t try anything.” Eirene promised hastily.
“Just let me alone for a little. I should like to go out somewhere and
howl, but that would attract attention. Leave me alone here and go
back to the others. I shall be all right presently.”

Eirene obeyed, the more readily that the sight of Zoe in this mood
frightened her horribly. A sense of duty had made her follow her, but
she ran back gladly to the verandah and Maurice. He met her below the
steps, and she nestled close to him.

“Oh, Maurice, I am so glad I have you!” she whispered. “It is horrible
to be a woman alone, even if you can’t help it.”

Into the meaning of this cryptic utterance Maurice did not inquire,
but it was some little time before he rearranged the floating odds and
ends of the Greek dress, and led her up the steps into the field of
view of the patient Armitage, demanding sternly what she meant by
running away when she was sitting for her portrait. She was posed
afresh against the pillar, and Armitage went on with his sketch, but
it seemed that fate was warring against its completion. Only a few
strokes had been added when Professor Panagiotis appeared on the
verandah and invited Maurice’s attention.

“It is rather a serious matter, though the cause is a trifling one,”
he said. “Perhaps you would prefer to discuss it privately?”

“I knew we were not married enough!” groaned Maurice. “Wylie always
said we ought to have four weddings at least, and we have only had two
and a half--counting Sir Frank’s presence as the half. Well, Eirene,
you’re just as much concerned as I am, so you had better come. Put in
some background or something, can’t you, Armitage, while we’re gone?”

The Professor ushered them into his private room with some ceremony,
as though to remind them of the position they held in his plans for
the future. On the table lay a document written on parchment in Greek
characters.

“It was about this that the slight difficulty arose,” said the
Professor. “I thought it well to draw up a brief statement of the
circumstances of your marriage, with the signatures of the witnesses,
in view of possible developments. One copy you would take to England
and place among your family papers, the other I would either entrust
to the custody of the Œcumenical Patriarch or put in a safe place of
my own, as you prefer. In these days of dynamite, one can never be
sure that some night the British and Dacian Consulates will not be
blown up simultaneously, and both the original registers destroyed. I
have the signatures of the Consuls, you see, but unfortunately Papa
Sotirios, the old priest whom we chose to perform the ceremony on
account of the simplicity of his character and his detachment from
politics, makes a difficulty. You noticed, of course”--turning
suddenly to Maurice--“that you were described in the service as ‘the
Orthodox Prince Maurice, son of Theodore,’ just as your bride was
termed ‘the Orthodox Princess Eirene, daughter of Nicholas’?”

“Not I,” said Maurice. “I knew it was Greek he was reading, and of
course I grasped the general drift, but I couldn’t follow his
pronunciation a bit.” Eirene’s eyes were anxious.

“Well, it is really very troublesome and absurd,” said the Professor,
in hearty, paternal tones, “but it seems Papa Sotirios observed that
you did not venerate the ikons on leaving the church, and when I saw
him afterwards, he insisted on knowing whether you were truly
Orthodox. It sounds ridiculous, but actually, in the hurry of
arranging for the wedding, and the difficulty of doing so without
arousing notice, I never thought of mentioning that you had not yet
joined the Greek Church. Your name disarmed suspicion, and the
Patriarch sent his blessing, as Papa Sotirios performed his office, in
ignorance of your schismatical standpoint.”

“But does that vitiate the marriage?” cried Maurice. “Nonsense! of
course it can’t. The civil ceremony in the presence of the two Consuls
can never be upset.”

“Oh no, quite so,” said the Professor hurriedly. “Nothing can touch
the validity of the marriage. But in the eyes of the people, you
see--well, any informality about the religious ceremony----”

“Would the marriage not have been allowed to take place if it had been
known that I was not a Greek?” demanded Maurice.

“Well, it is true that, strictly speaking, mixed marriages are
forbidden. Of course, the prohibition often yields to special
circumstances. And as the marriage has taken place, I don’t see that
its religious validity could be questioned. It is merely that we ought
to avoid the slightest suspicion of any informality in your case. You
must remember that Prince Christodoridi will be on the watch for any
flaw in your title from the moment you come into the public eye.”

“But according to him, my title is nothing but a series of flaws, by
what you told me at first. You said he would declare every foreign and
non-Orthodox marriage in my family a bar to my succeeding.”

“Exactly, but--there is a further consideration. From that point of
view, the Princess, your wife, has now contracted a heterodox
marriage, and therefore loses her right of succession, the only one
incontestably superior to Prince Christodoridi’s.”

“Well, but what’s to be done?” cried Maurice, after a pause of dismay.
“We must be married over again, I suppose. But no, that would be no
good, and you say they wouldn’t allow the wedding to take place. I
have always known that my rights were not worth much if the bigots got
the upper hand, but I can’t let my wife lose her rights through me. I
suppose you have something to suggest?”

“A very simple and practicable expedient, happily. You have only to
announce your adhesion to the Orthodox Church at once. A brief
renunciation of the errors of your former schismatical creed, and a
profession of faith--equally short--uttered in the presence of Papa
Sotirios and other accredited witnesses, will put everything right.”

“But how? I don’t see----” began Maurice.

“The conversion and the marriage will have taken place on the same
day,” said the Professor, patiently and impressively, “and it will
naturally be accepted that the conversion came first. The priest will
be glad to fall in with the wishes of so distinguished a convert, the
Consuls can say nothing either way, as the subject was not broached in
their presence, my silence may be relied on. The Princess’s claims are
safe, while yours are infinitely strengthened.”

“But I have no intention----”

“It will merely be anticipating a step which you must have taken
eventually, and which will come from you now with a much better grace.
No one not belonging to the Orthodox Church could be considered as a
serious candidate for the heritage of John Theophanis.”

“And yet you have invited me to consider myself a serious candidate
without saying a word about this?”

“The thing was so obvious that no mention was needed. It was certain
that the necessity would force itself upon you as soon as you
considered the question at your leisure.” The Professor’s tone was
bold, but his eyes were shifty.

“Well, it hasn’t. What’s more, the exact opposite has. If I had felt
any drawing towards the Greek Church before I came to Emathia, what I
have seen would have altered my views. My object is to unite the
Emathian Christians, not to accentuate their divisions. To throw
myself on the side of the Patriarchists would make every Slav in
Emathia my bitter enemy. Why, I would almost rather turn Exarchist, as
my wife is already enlisted on the Greek side.”

“A heterodox Emperor is no Emperor,” said the Professor, with deadly
meaning.

“A good many of my ancestors were not particularly Orthodox,” said
Maurice drily.

“All the Christians in Emathia--Greeks and Slavs alike--would unite
against the heretic who dared to aspire to----”

“I’m very glad to hear it,” Maurice broke in. “First time in their
history they ever united for or against anything. I should have
achieved a triumph. But I don’t believe they would. If they have never
united against the Moslem they would scarcely do it against me.”

“Are you so false to your race that you could bring yourself to adopt
a neutral, even a hostile, attitude towards it?” cried the Professor.
“Are our sufferings, our sacrifices, our efforts towards emancipation,
clogged by the dead weight of the sullen indifference of the Slavs,
nothing to you?”

“I think the Greeks are getting hard measure at present, undoubtedly,
but it’s only what they have given in the past. Your ignorant,
avaricious priests and self-seeking Bishops and Patriarchs have much
to answer for in alienating the people upon whom they were forced.
Your men of letters have stifled all culture but their own, and they
have their reward in a population bitterly hostile to Greek and
ignorant of everything else.”

“Mr Teffany,” said the Professor angrily, “this is very fine, but it
is not business. It is absurd to think that the party I represent will
consent to throw its influence on the side of a candidate who derides
its most cherished institutions and ideals. I ask you plainly, are you
prepared to join the Orthodox Church and accept whole-heartedly the
Hellenising programme of the Greek party in Emathia, as the price--if
you choose to call it so--of its support of your claims?”

“And I answer you plainly--I am not.”

“Don’t decide hastily,” urged the Professor. “You may not be aware
that since your rescue I have made some progress in sounding the
representatives of the Powers on the subject of your claims. Sick of
the clamour for reform, and the slight success of the steps already
achieved, they did not turn an unfriendly ear. A Christian
Governor-General, with the support of the most influential section of
the population assured to him, ought to succeed, and the neutral
Powers seemed to think so. There remain Scythia and Pannonia. Scythia
never fights against the inevitable; you are far more likely to suffer
from her patronage than her hostility. Pannonia cannot afford to be
outdone in unselfish magnanimity by Scythia. In fact, the signs are so
favourable that we cannot pause. If you desert us, we must press the
claims of Prince Christodoridi, whose way will be cleared by your
destruction of the claims of the Princess, your wife.”

“Eirene,” said Maurice, “do you want me to secure your rights at the
Professor’s price?” His tone was harsh, and Eirene knew the reason. He
could not be sure which side she would take. She responded to the
unuttered appeal.

“Not at the price of your conscience. Do what you feel is right. Our
claims remain as just as they ever were.”

Maurice’s hand sought hers in the joyful assurance of confidence not
misplaced. “My wife and I are agreed,” he said. “We maintain our
independence.”

“I am sorry to hear it, but there is no more to be said. You have
chosen your own course, and you know the consequences----” The
sentences shot out venomously.

“Most certainly, but we hold ourselves at liberty to take any steps
that may commend themselves to us in support of our rights. We are
still the heirs of John Theophanis, and both the common law of Europe
and actual Byzantine usage are on our side. Come, Eirene.”

They left the Professor moodily gnawing the end of a penholder at his
table, and once outside the room, Maurice put his arm round his wife.
“You know I would rather have cut off my right hand than married you
if I had known what you would lose by it,” he said.

“Maurice,” she said quickly, “you know I don’t mind. If you had
yielded to him, it would have destroyed all my faith in you. I was
afraid--oh, dreadfully afraid for a moment, that you would do it for
my sake, but something seemed to keep me from saying a word. And now
I am glad. But you don’t see”--she broke into something very like
hysterics--“that even what he wanted you to do would not have put
things right. It would only have been a trick, a dishonest compact
between you and him and the priest. I should have married a schismatic
after all!”

“By Jove, so you would!” cried Maurice. “The Professor’s too deep for
me. Why, he would have had us completely under his thumb. If we had
kicked, he would only have had to hint that the priest’s conscience
was becoming uneasy about his share in the business, or that he
himself could give Prince Christodoridi an important piece of
information if he liked, and we should have had to cave in. Little
girl, we have not only told the truth, but shamed the--tempter!”

 * * * * * * * *

“‘My native land--good night’!” said Maurice impressively, looking
back from the deck of the steamer at the semicircle of twinkling
lights which represented Therma.

“‘A long, a last adieu’!” said Zoe, not without regret.

“Not a bit of it!” said Maurice. “We’re only going to recruit our
strength for further efforts.”

“My dear boy,” said Zoe solemnly, “Cambridge ought to reject you with
ignominy, and Oxford gather you to her bosom with tears of joy. You
are a lost cause in yourself.”

“I’m a made man,” declared Maurice, feeling Eirene’s hand creep
sympathetically into his. “I came out with an open mind and a sense of
duty. Now I have a wife whom I have robbed of her rights. Clearly I am
bound in honour to recover them for her.”

“Men always say that it’s women who lose sight of a cause in an
individual,” said Zoe sententiously.

“I don’t quite follow you, Zoe. I am the cause--the lost cause--you
said so just this minute; and Eirene is the individual. Oh, I see--and
we are one. That’s all right.”
